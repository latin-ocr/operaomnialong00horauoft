360 HORATII FLACCI

SATIRE IV.

Here again Horace is at pains to defend himself from the charge of malevolcnee.
'rhat this charge was loudly brought against him is clean and the second Satire of
this book may have gone a long way towards making him enemies. But he must have
written many more pieces than that, for he speaks of ‘mea scripta’ (v. 23), ‘meos
libellos ' (v. 71). It is probable his other Satires were in the same strain as the second,
which appears to have been published as a specimen of the style he here defends, but
which he thought fit to abandon, for there are no other Satires of that kind. Inde-
pendent of the above, Horace here shows something of an author's soreness in respect
to the neglect his poems had met with, compared with others which he believed to have
less merit ς and though he attributes it entirely to the jealousy and fears of the multi-
tude, every man apprehending that he may be attacked next, it is clear that he puts it
down in some measure to a false taste which preferred a wordy flowing style to the
terseness and accuracy of his own. The poems of Lucilius were popular in spite of the
looseness of their compositionand many defects, which a depraved taste had come to
regard as merits. (See note on v. 6.) The virulence of Lucilius’s Satires did not affect
Horace’s generation, who could afford to admire them, but had no liking for verses that
came home to themselves. Horace began his career as a satirical writer with Lucilius
for his model, and the second Satire is a specimen of the style resulting from that
imitation. It sat uneasily upon him. Lucilius he found, with all his power and his
merite, was not the model for him, and he was probably taunted with coming short of
the vig-our of his original,-and this perhaps by the persons who were loudest in charging
him with a malignant temper. He had therefore to set himself right in respect to
Lucilius, and this he does both here and elsewhere (S. 10 and ii. 1) with much good
temper, candour, and forbearance. He has also to contrast his own pretensions with
those of the Crispini and Fannii of the day, as well as to quiet the apprehensionis
of his friends, and disarm the malignity of his enemies, and these are the objects
of the Satire. Every body must admire the way in which he takes occasion, from the
necessity of self-defeuce, to pay a tribute of grateful affection to his father's memory,
and it would be difficult to find a more pleasing picture of paternal solicitude and sound
sense, as applied to a boy's education, than Horace has drawn in the latter part of this
Satire.

About the date, Franke says it must have been written before *Lu-c. 716, when
Asinius Pollio first introduced the practice of regular reeitations of their works by
authors. He says Horace would not have treated the reciters so contemptuously if
their practice had come into fashiou through the example of his friend Pollio. As Ι
have said on v. 73, Ι (10 not think the practice alluded to by Horace has any thing to
do with Pollio’s practice 3 and as to Fannius’ books and bust having been deposited, as
some have said, in the library built by this same Pollio in Ass-c, 715, there is not the
remotest reason to believe it. Franke says Horace could not at this time have been on
good terms with Augustus, or he would not have mentioned “ acerba irrisione'' Petillius
Capitolinus (94 sqq.), who was a friend of his. But the only bitterness in Horace’s
words is in the sneer which he puts into the mouth of Petillius’ friend and condemns.
111 short, the Satire appears to me to contain no clue to the date ‚- but it certainly con-
cerns Horace's early reputation‚ and so must be placed early, and not very long aster
S. 2, which he quotes in v. 92.
