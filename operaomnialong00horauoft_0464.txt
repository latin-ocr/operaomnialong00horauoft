HORATII FLACCI

vigorous taste than Hermogenes or Deme-
trius pos ssessed to appreciate or even to
read such writers as Aristophanes and his
brethren‚ for whom he had an unbounded
admiration. It might be supposed that
Horace intends to express a poor opinion
of Calvus and Catullus : but I cannot see
why if a man were to say of a modern
English coxcomb who could do nothing
better than please a circle of ladies with a
popular song and agreeable voice, that he
could sing Moore’s ballads from beginning
⁷to end, but could not understand a line of

“ Shakspeare, therefore he was dis1)araging

that graceful song-writer, between whom
and Shakspeare there can be no compari-
son, as there could be none between Ca-
tullus and Aristophanes.

20. quod verbis Graeca Latinis] This
is a new fault in Lucilins’ style not before
mentioned. See the note on S. 4. 6.
Cicero's advice in respect to the consist-
ency of our lives is illustrated thus: “Ut
enim sermone eo debemus uti qui notus est
nobis, ne ut quidam Graeca verba incul-
cantes jure optimo rideamur, sic in ac-
tiones omnemque vitam nullam discrepan-
tiam conferre debemus '' (De Off. i. 31).
‘Seri studiorum ’ represents the Greek
ὀψιμαθεῖς, to whom Theophrastus dovotes
one of his least descriptive characters. In
‘quine putetis ³ the interrogative enclitic
is somewhat redundant, but not more than
in many other instances, as S. ii. 2. 107,
“Uterne Ad casus dubios fidet sibi cer-
tius 122’ and iii. 295, 317. Orelli says the
construction is compounded of two, ‘pu-
tatis ne 3² ’ and ‘ qui putetis Ρ ’ comparing
Plautus (Trucul. ii. 6. 53), “ Quine etiam-
num super adducas?” and Bentley thus
quotes Terence (Adelph. ii. 3. 9), “ Quine
onmia sibi postputarit esse prae meo com-
modo ”P in his note on Horace. [But he
has the indicative in his Terence, and
without (P).]

22. Rhodio quod Pitholeonti] The
Scholiasts say he was an absurd writer of

epigrams, in which he mixed up Greek
words with the Latin. Torrentius was of
opinion, and Bentley and Weichert (Poet.
Lat. Rel. p. 333) of the same, that the
person meant is a freedman of one Otaci-
lius, whose name he bore (M. Otacilius
Pitholaus), of whom Suetonius, in his life
of C. Julius Caesar (c. '7 5), says that he
attaeked Caesar in some very abusive
verses, but that Caesar took it with good
temper. His name was Pitholaus, but
Horace might change that termination
without violating the Greek usage, as
Τιμόλαος and Τιμόλεων,“ Μενέλαος and
Μενέλεως, &c., are different forms of the
same name. There is some probability in
the conjecture.

24«. ut Chio nota si] On ‘nota’ seeo.
ii. 3. 8. Here the Chian, a sweet wine,
would represent the Greek as the rougher ,
wine of Campania would stand for the less-
polished Latin.

26. causa Petilli] See S. 4. 9411.

27. Scilicet oblitua] Against all the
MSS. Bentley suggests, and Heindorf
adopts, ‘oblitos‚’ to be governed by ‘malis.’
The received reading, which addresses it-
self to the supposed advocate of a mixed
language, gives just as good sense as the
other, in my opinion. Bentley revives the
reading of the old editions, ‘Latiniss which
Lambinus, on good authority, since con-
firmed by other MSS„ changed to ‘La-
tine.' Bentley and Gesner, who follows
him, can find no better explanation of ‘pa-
tris Latini' than king Latinus. [This is
also the explanation of Heindorf and Ritter,
who have ‘oblitos ’ and ‘Latini.'] With
‘oblitus’ and ‘ Latine’ the whole passage
runs thus: “You say that the language
is more elegant if it be set off with Greek.
But 1 ask you yourself, is it only when you
are writing poetry ; or supposing you had
on hand a difficnlt cause, such as that of
Petillius, would you then likewise, foi-get-
