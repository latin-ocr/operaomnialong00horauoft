the senate; and the Appius of nuc 704
did eJ ’eet them, as we are told, and the old
censor Appius admitted them. Stin, as
nox-we names Laevinus and Decius, it is
possible that the famous old censor was in
his thoughts, and not the modern Appius.

their official rank were qualified ιο be se·
nators. They effectedthisexclusion merely
by marking the name, and their mark was

they did their duty strictly, would de·
