HORATII FLACCI

Quis Parthum paveat, quis gelidum Scythen, 25
Quis Germania quos horrida parturit
Fetus, incolumi Caesare ⁶? quis ferae
Bellum curet Hiberiae ⁴?
Condit quisque diem vcollibus in suis

Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores >3

Hinc ad vina redit laetus et alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum;

Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero

Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum

Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris

35

Et magni memor Herculis.
Longas o utinam, dux bone, ferias
Praestes Hesperiae! dicimus integro
Sicci mane die, dicimus uvidi

Cum Sol Oceano subest.

sossioss’ ‘ Pacatum ' means delivered from
. pii-ates. The commentators quote Suet.
(Oct. 98), “ Vectorae nautaeque de navi
Alexandrina Augusto acclamarunt per illum
se vivere, perillum navigare, libertate atque
fortunis per illum f1·ui.'’ ‘Mos et lex' is
the combination required in C. iii. 24. 35 :
“Quid leges sine moribus-’² On the dis-
tinction between ‘mos' and ⁷ ‘lex‚’ see
article ‘Jus’ in Smith's Dict. Ant.⁴ ‘Lau-
dantur simili prole puerperae'- is a way
of expressing chastity derived from the
Greeks, as—

τίκτουσιν δὲ ’γυναῖκες ἐοικότα τέκνα 70-

νεῦσιν. (Hesiod, Op. et Di. 235.)

μὴ προαγωγεύσῃς ἄλοχον σέο τέκνα μιαί-

οὐιῒὶιῖῗτει ’γὰρ παῖδας ὁμοίους μοιχικὰ λέκ·

τρα. (Pseudo-Phocylides Gnom. 177.
Bergk, 352.)

Horace is referring in these verses to the
Lex J ulia de Adulteriis passed in the time
of Augustus A.U.c. 736.

25. Quis Parthum] This stanza shows
that the enemies mentioned were still ob·
jects of nneasiness 3 but the Parthians were
at this time quiet, the most troubloeome
of the German tribes had been humbled by
Augustus or his stepsonsx, and he was em-
ployed in quelling disturbances in Spain.

29. Condit] For other examples of this
nse of ‘ condere,’ which signifies to bringto
an end, and as it were to lay up in sture,
sce Pon cellnn J udah and Israel dwelt
safely, every man under his vine and under
his fig· trec, from Dan cvcn to Beer -sheba,

all the days of Solomon'’ (1 Kings iv. 25).
For ‘ redit' (v. 31), Bentley, Cunningham,
and Sanadon prefer ‘venit.’ The allitera-
tion is sufficient objection to that reading,
which is supported by very little authority.
“ A man does not return to his wine except
when he has been drinking beforest’ says
Bentley. But a man may be said ‘ ad
vina redire’ when he returns home from
his day's work to his evening meal. “ Quid
non critica cogis pectora, novitatis amor !'’
rightly exclaims J ani. At the second course
it was usual to offer libations'and prayers
to the Lares. Dion cass. (li. 19) says that
after the battle of Actium the senate de-
creed that all men should offer libations to
Octavian at private tables 88 well as in the

public feasts, and that his name should be
inserted' m the hym ns of praise as the name
of the Gods. The reading ‘diffuso’ for

‘’defnso is that of a large number of MSS„
but‘ diffuso’ only applies to the drawing
off wine from the dolium into the amphora,
i. e. what we should 8811 bottling it. Here
a libation is meant, to which ‘defuso' 18
appropriate. Bentley's defence of the read-
ing of some MSS. ‘ Rex bone’ for ‘dux
bone’ is inadmissible. It does not follow
because Horace in a familiar way calls
Maecenas ‘rex’ (Epp. i. 7. 37), therefore
he would apply the word seriously or
familiarly, which would be impertinent,
to Augustus, whose policy it was to avoid
the title.

[30. viduas] The trees are ‘viduae,’

‘solitary‚' until they are married to the
vine. See Epod. ii. 9: ⁶ adulta vitium
propagine-intas maritat populos.’]
