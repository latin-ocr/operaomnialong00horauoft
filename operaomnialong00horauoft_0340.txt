304 HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN XIII.

This ode is like the ninth of the first book,—a convivial song written in winter. A
politica] allusion is extracted from v. 7 as from v. 9 of the other ode, and in either
case we may suppose it possible that the troubles of the times are included in those
anxieties which were to be left to the gods. But this proves nothing as to time,
except that they were both written before the close of the civil wars, which is certain
as respects this ode, and very probable as to the other. There can be little doubt of
the subject as well as the metre being imitated from the Greek. The reference to
Achilles reminds us of C. i. 8, and of the allusion to Teucer (C. i. 7). There is a frag-
ment of Anacreon (6 Bergk) which bears some likeness to the opening of this Epode :—

μεὶς μὲν δὴ Ποσιδηῖῶν
ἕστηκεν, νεφέλη δ’ ὕδωρ
* ³* *ί* βαρὺ δ’ ἄγριοι
χειμῶνες παταγεῦσιν.

ᾼΒαυΜΕΝΤ.

The tempest is raging, let us make merry, my friends while we are young, and leave
the rest to the gods who will give us a good turn yet. Bring ointmeut and music,

’ as Chiron taught his great Pupil, saying, “ To Troy thou must go and not return 3
while there drown care in wine and song, which are grief's pleasant comforters.”

HORRIDA tempestas caelum contraxit et imbres
Nivesque deducunt J ovem; nunc mare, nunc siluae

Threicio Aquilone sonant: rapiamus, amici,
Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua

1. commate-it] This word may be ex-
plained by observing the different aspect
of the sky when it is closed in with clouds,
and when it is spread out in all its breadth
and cloudless. A frowning sky is a notion
easily understood, and common to all lan-

es,

Virgil (Ecl. vii. 60) : “ Jupiter et laeto de-
scendet plurimus imbri.’' Georg. ii. 325 :—

“ Tum pater omnipotens fecundis imbribus

Cohgiilg‘ig in gremium laetae descendit.”

3. rapiamus, amici, occasionem de die]
This is explained by C. iii. 8. 27 : “ Dona
praesentis cape laetus horae.” ‘ Die ' means
the present day as opposed to to-morrow,
not‚as some take it, ‘from this stormy day!
Bentley proposes ‘amice' for ‘amici’ be-
cause of v. 6 ; but ‘ tu’ refers to the sym-
posiarch. Fen, following Cruquius, sup-

poses the ode to be addressed to one person,
and the storm to be a figurative way of ex-
pressing the state of public affairs, which is
absurd. He and some others make ‘ amici'
the nominative case.

have no meaning. What vitality is there
in the knees more than in any other part Ρ
The strength of an active man lies very
much in his legs, and so the are put for
his strength, asin the 147th m (v. 10) :
‘⁸ He delighteth not in the strength of the
horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs
of a man :'' and the knees are a chief part
of the legs, therefore γούνατα λύειν is used
for κτείνειν. The expression θεῶν ἐν γού-
