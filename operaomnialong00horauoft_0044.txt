8 HORATII FLACCI

Caesar, in an ode which hailed the return of Octavianum nor could he have alluded to it
better than in connexion with those prodigies which seemed to speak the wrath of
Heaven against civil discord. Other poets wrote of these prodigies, which were very
notorious. See Tibull. ii. 5. ¹71, sqq. ς Ovid, Met. xv. 782, sqq. ; and one phenomenon
poetically described by Horace is recorded by Dion. (xlv. 17): καὶ ἰχθῦς ἐκ τῆς
θαλάσσης ἀμύθητοι κατὰ τὰς τοῦ Τιβέριδος ἐκβολὰς ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον ἐξέπεσον.

If this ode is read with C. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the Introduction to
that ode, the feeling with which Horace entered into the mission of Augustus as the
reformet will be better understood.

ARGUMEN T

Portents enough hath Jove sent upon the earth, making it afraid lest a. new deluge
were coming, as the Tiber rolled back from its mouth threatening destruction to the
city, the unauthorized avenger of Ilia!

Our sons shall hear that citizens have whetted for each other the steel that should have
smitten the enemy.

What god shall we invoke to help us P What prayers shall move Vesta to pity ἶ) To
whom shall Jove assign the task of wiping out our guilt Ρ Come thou, Apollo3 or thou,
smiling Venus, with mirth and love thy companions; or thou, Mars, our founder,
who hast too long sported with war ς or do thom-son of Maia, put on the form of a
man, and let us call thee the avenger of Caesar ς nor let our sins drive thee too soon
away ς here take thy triumphs3 be thou our father and our prince, and suffer not
the Mede to go unpunished whilst thou art our chief, O Caesar.

dirae] It is very common in Horace
(though not peculim· to him) to find an
epithet which is attached to the latter of two
substantives, but belongs to both, as here,

“ and “fidem mutatosque Deos ’³ (C. i. 5. 6) 5

“ poplitibus timidoque tergo '’ (C. iii. 2. 16),
and many other places which the student
will observe for himself. Horace uses this
construction so frequently, that it may be
looked upon as a feature in his style 3 and
he often uses it with effect.

2. rubente] Vix-gil has (G. i. 328) “Co-
rusca dextra‚” where, however, it may be
doubted whether ‘ corusca' belongs to ‘ful-
mina ’ or to ‘dext-ra? Some MSS. have ‘ru-
benti.’ But Bentley (on C. i. 25. 17) quotes
Verrius Flaccus, a grammarian of the Au·
gustan age, who lays down the rule that
in Horace all nouns ending in ‘ ns' have

the termination of the ablativc in ‘e,’ not
‘i.' This is not true in respect to some
words, which though they have the force
of adjectiveS‚ are in fact participles. For
instance, “Ab insolenti temperatam lae-
titia ’⁹ (C. ii. 3. 3). Bentley, therefore,
attributes too much perhaps to the autho-
rity of his grammarian in adopting this as
an invariable rule in respect to the par-
ticiple.

3. arces] The sacred buildings on the
Capitoline hill. They were called collec-
tively Capitolium or Arx (from their posi-
tion), Arx Capitolii, and sometimes by
hendiadys, “Arx Capitoliumque '’ (Livy, v.
39, διο.) They embraced the three tem·
ples of J up. Opt. Max„ J uno, and Minerva,
of Jupiter Feretrius, and of Terminus.

10. columbis] The proper name for a
wood-pigeon is ‘palumbus,’ or ‘—-ba‚' or
