500 HORATII FLACCI

Et Tyrias dare circum inluta toralia vestes,
Oblitum quanto curam sumptumque minorem
Haec habeant tanto reprehendi justius illis

Quae nisi divitibus nequeant contingere mensis ?’'
“ Docte Cati, per amicitiam divosque rogatus
Ducere me auditum perges quocunque mementos
Nam quamvis memori referas mihi pectore cuncta,
Non tamen interpres tantundem juveris. Adde
Vultum habitumque hominis, quem tu vidisse beatus
Non magni pendis quia contigit 3 at mihi cura
Non mediocris inest, fontes ut adire remotos
Atque haurire queam vitae praecepta beatae.'’

Dict. Ant. ‘Torus’ is a round pillow.
‘ Toral' would therefore be something be-
longing to the pillows, and seems to sig-
nify something put over the rich ‘ stragula
vestis' (see last Satire, v. 118 n.), as we

dei-lein says that ‘⁸ ‘circum’ belongs to
‘inluta toraniam]

85. Oblitum quanto] Catius says that
the neglect of those matters, which eost
little and require but little attention, is

put chintz coverings over our furniture
when it is not in use, or on ordinary occa-
sions. Becker thinks ‘mappae' and ‘to-

> ralia’ mean here the same thing, because

‘scopae’ and ‘palma’ do so. He finds
fault with Heindorf for saying that the
‘toralia’ were coverings for the cushions.
>He says that they were hangings with
which the ‘lectus’ was draped from the
‘ torus ' to the floor, relying upon a descrip-
tion of Petronius. But by this he contra-
dicts himself, since the ‘mappae ' were not
hangings. See Becker-’s Gallus, pp. 367.
369, Engl. abrt. Inviting his friend Tor—
quatus to dinner, Horace tells him he will
take care “ne turpe toral, ne sordida
mappa Corruget nares” (Epp. i. 5. 22).

more reprehensible than the absence of
furniture, which the rich only can afford.
The case he supposes is that of a man who
combines dirt with finery, slovenliness with
ostentation.

88. Docte Cati] Catius, having brought
his discourse to an end with an exhortatiou
upon decency and order, Horace entreats
him wherever he goes to get such lessons
to take him with him, that he may drink
wisdom at the fountain head. Catius, he
says, no doubt repeats accurately what
he has heard, but such precepts would be
more highly commended by the asmot,
bearing, and voice of the teacher himself.

94. fontes ut adire remotos] Horace
here parodies Lucretius (i. 927): “juvat

SATIRE V.

In this Satire, which has a good deal of humour in it, Horace takes up the practice
of will-hunting, of which, as of many other degrading vices that afterwards pervaded
Roman society, he saw only the beginning. . Describing the rage for making money in
Epp. i. 1. 77, he says,— ·

“ Pars hominum gestit conducere publica: sunt qui

Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras
Excipiantque senes quos in vivaria mittant.'’

Τὴε practice was sufficiently common in Cieero’s time to be thus spoken of by him
(Paradox. v. 2) :—“An eorum servitus dubia est qui cupiditate peculii nullam condi·
tionem recusant durissimae servitutis? Hereditatis spes quid iniquitatis in serviendo
non suscipit P quem nutum locupletis orbi senis non observat Ρ loquitur ad voluntatem ς
