536 HORATII FLACCI

SATIRE VIII.

This Satire represents a dinner given by a rich vulgar man to Maecenas and five of
his friends. There is not so much to distinguish it in the way of humour as the subject
admitted of. Few things present more scope for facetious satire than the airs of rich
men, whose wealth is their one passport into what is called good society. This is avery
slight sketch, and some of the force even of this is perhaps lost through our ignorance
of little points of etiquette and culinary refinements observed by the Romans of that
day.

The host's name is Nasidienus Rufus. Lambinus supposes Q. Salvidienus Rufus to
be meant, a man of obscure origin whom Augustus advanced toequestrian rank for
services rendered against Sex. Pompeius, and who was afterwards consul designatus.
He put an end to himself in A.U.c. 714, which was long before this Satire was written,

*and the theory would not be worth mentioning if Heindorf and Buttmann had not
supported it. Spohn (J ahn's Horace, Ed. ii. p. 271) supposes Q. Nasidius, one of the
commanders under M.Antonius and mentioned by Dio Cassius (50. c. 13), to be the host.
But as we cannot arrive at any real knowledge on the subject, and as the essence of the
Satire consists in the obscurity of the person, it is useless to speculate about him.

Instead of telling the story himself, though it is probable from the tone of the Satira
that he writes from a scene he had witnessed, Horace puts it into the mouth of his
friend Fundanius, the comio writer mentioned in S. i. 10. 42 11.

It is impossible to conjecture with any probability the date of the Satire‚ though it

may be assumed that it was written 81181· Horace-‘s intimacy with Maecenas had
begun.
