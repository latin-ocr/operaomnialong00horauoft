‘incendia' does not neoessarily mean the
burning of Carthago, but· 1s only another
way of expressing the overthrow of its
power by the elder Scipio, or 1118 burning
of the 11881, or of the camp of Syphax.
But, considering the notoriety of the final
destruction of that city by fire, this would
only be charging Horace with wantonly
confusing his readers. And yet it would
seem that the Scholiasta and the older 80111-
mentators all understand only one Scipio
to be referred 10, 88(1 they must have under-
stood the line therefore in some way 008-
sistent with such an interpretation. It must
not be overlooked that the verse “Ejus
qui,” &c.‚ applies to either of the Scipiones.
Another remedy which is proposed is to
suppose that two verses have been lost aster
the seventeen th, which would haveexplained
its meaning ς 1118 ground of which hypo-
thaeis is, that odes in this measure, of which
however there are but two others (C. i. 1,
and iii. 30), are so written as to be capable
of division into 8188888 of four lines each,
and this ode wants two verses 10 make it
meet that rule. But the rule' 18 arbitrary,
and a precarions foundation for such an

spurious (Myt vol. ii. append.

18 founded on the rhythm, which Ι hardly
think can be admitted as sufficient. Bax-

usually are: “Nollem Bentleius ita se tur-
