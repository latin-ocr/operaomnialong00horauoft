consisted of things calculated to provoke
the appetite, of which a list is given in the
eighth Satire of the second book, v. 8 sq„
where however eggs are not mentioned.
These things were eaten with a draught of
‘mulsum' (S. ii. 2. 15 ιι.) sometimes be-
fore they sat down, or even before they
left the bath. So Martial (xii. 19) says,—
“In thermis sumit lactucas, ova, lacer-

tum.” See Becker’s Gallus, Exc. ‘The
Meals!

7. citaret, Io Bacche] This use of ‘ci-
tare,' ‘to shout,’ is not common. Forcel-
lini only quotes Cic. de Oratore, i. 59,
‘⁶ Citare Paeanem.'' Bentley says that
‘ citare Io Bacche’ is not Latin, and he asks
, where we shall meet with such a phrase as
‘citare cantilenam? He overlooked the
above passage of Cicero. He conjectures
and adopts ‘ iteraret,' quoting C. ii. 19. 12,
“lapsa cavis iterare mella.'’ There were
convivial songs among the Greeks to which
they gave the name ἷόβακχοι. Several
fragments of such songs by Archilochus
have been preserved in Athenaeus and
elsewhere (see Bergk’s Poet. Lyr. p. 490
sqq.). The final syllable in Bacche is
lengthened, and should properly be pro·
nounced as the singer might be supposed
to pronouuce it. The caesural place in
the verse is not enough to account for the
lengthening of the syllable, as Orelli says
it is. ‘ Io Bacchae ' is found in some MSS„
being introduced evidently to save the
metre. [Ritter has ‘ Bacchae.'] Such was
the cry in Euripides' play of the Bacchae,
v. 57 6,-

ἷώ, κλύετ’ ἐμᾶς κλύετ’ αὐδᾶς,
ὦ βάκχαι, ἰὼ βάκχαι.
The strings in the tetrachord, from which
the low notes proceeded, were uppermost
as the player held it in his hand, and the
notes of the voice which corresponded with
these are expressed by ‘summa voce.’ For
the same reason the high notes would be
those which harmonized with the lowest
of the strings. The ‘summa chorda’ was
called in Greek ὑπάτη, and the ‘ima’ νήτη.
Ι understand ‘chordis' to be⁰ the dative
case, the literal translation being ‘that
voice which is the lowest (where 'for thc

above reason those notes are called tha
lowest which we should call the highest),
and that echoes to the four stringe?

11. Junonis sacra ferret] This refers
to the ‘canephoroe,' damsels who carried
the basket of sacred instrumenta on their
head at sacrifices. Those of Juno are men-
tioned here; but the practice was oboerved
at all sacrifices. A woodcut from an ante-
fixum' m the Britis h Museum, representing
two girls carrying the basket, will be
found in Smith’ s Dict. Ant. art. ‘Cane-
phoroe? See also Cic. in Verr. ii. 4. 3,
Long’s note, and Cicero (De Off. 1. 36)=

“ne tarditatibus . . . utamur ut pompa-
rum ferculis similes aese videamur?

—habebat saepe ducentos] Bentley
substitutes ‘’alebat for ‘shabebat but
though‘ alere servos 'and βόσκειν οικέτας
are expressions in use, there is no reason
for deserting the MSS. Ten slaves were a
very small household for a rich man, and
Tigellius was rich. In respect to the num—
ber of slaves usual in wealthy houses,
which in primitive times was small, but
latter-ly grew to an extraordinary number,
see Becker’s Gallus Exc. ‘on the Slave
Famil

12. y? modo reyes atque tetrarchas]

‘’Modo‚ as an adverb of time, signifies
‘now‚’ or some time not far from the pre-
sent. It is the ablative of ‘modusl ‘ mea:
sure,’ and ‘modo’ is within measure, and ⁴
therefore its sense is confined to limited
quantities. Compare the use of ‘modo'
aud ‘admodum’ in Terence (Hec. iii. 5.
8): “Advenis modo? Pam. Admodum.”
‘ Are you coming now ?—Just now? ‘Mo-
do,' thus comes to have the meaning of
‘nunc‚’ and to be used in the same oom-
binations, as here ‘nunc reges—loqueum
nunc, sit mihi mensa tripes’ would have
the same meaning, and likewise in S.‚10.

“Et sermone opus est, modo tristi, saepe
Dgffigssfite vicem, modo rhetoris atque
Ιηῗέἱὲἰῗη, urbani.’'
