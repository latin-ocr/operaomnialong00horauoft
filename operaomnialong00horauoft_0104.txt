speaks of the ‘familia Peripateticorum’
(Div. ii. 1) 3 and Horace supposes himself
to be asked ‘quo me duce, quo Lare tuter'
(Epp. i. 1. 13). Panaetius of Rhodos
(Cicero, Dc Off. iii. 2) left an unfinished
trcatise ‘de officiis’ in three books, and

Cicero professes to follow him as his chief
guide. He lived in the second century
B.c., was intimate with the younger Scipio
Africanus, and his lectum were attended
by P. Rutilius Rufus.

CARMEN XXX.

A fragment of one of Alcman's poems (10 Bergk) runs Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν λιποῖσα καὶ
Πάφον περίῤῥυτον, and of Sappho's (7 Bergk), ᾔ σε Κύπρος ἦ ndens ἦ Πάνορμος. A
longer fragment of Anacreon (2 Bergk), containing an invocation to Bacchus on
behalf of Cleobulus, is usually quoted in connexion with this ode, but it is not impro-
bable that the main incident of a lady sacriflcing or dedicating a little chapel to Venus

is taken from life.
ARGUMEN T.

“ Royal Venus, leave thy beloved Cyprus and come dwell in Glycera’s temple. Let
Love come with thee, and the (huces, and Nymphs, and Youtl] who is unlovely
without thee, and Mercury too.

O VERUS, regina Cnidi Paphique‚
Sperne dilectam Cypron, et vocantis
Ture te multo Glycerae decoram
Ἴ Transfer in aedem.
Fervidus tecum puer et solutis 5
Gratiae zonis properentque Nymphae
Et parum comis sine te J uventas
Mercuriusque. ’

2. Sperne dilectoem Qyp
hardly fail to have been taken from the
above fragment—Khwpou ἱμερτὰν λιποῖσα.
[There was a famous statue of Venus, a

naked figure, the work of Praxiteles, at
Cnidos, which pilgrims went to soe (Luciun,

nes, et quare virgines, solutaque ac perlucida
veste ?'’ Pausanias (ix. 35. 6) says that
thc older painters and sculptors represented
them clothed, but the later ones in his time
naked, οἱ δὲ ὕστερον οὐκ οῖδα ἐφ’ ὅτῳ μετα-
βεβλήκασι τὸ σχῆμα αὐταῖς. Χάριτας
’γοῦν οἱ κατ’ ἐμὲ ἔπλασσόν τε καὶ ἔγραφον

ron] This can

Ἔρωτες, ii. 397, Hemst.).]

4. aedem] The humblest houses had
their little chapel set apart for an image.
Tibullus alludes to this (i. 10. 20)—

“ Tunc melius tenuere fidem, cum paupere
Stggtilauin exigua ligneus aede deuS.’'

5. solutis Gratiae zonis] The Graces as
Seneca saw them were always painted and
sculptured with loose and transparcnt
drapery (De Benefic. i. c. 3) ε “ Quare tres
Gratiae et quasi sorores sunt, et quare ma-
nibus implexis, quare ridentes, quare juve-

γυμνιίς. See C. i. 4. 6; iii. 19. 16; iv.
7. 6.

7. Et parrum comis cine te Juventas]
See Homer (Hymn to Apollo, 195) t ἥβη τε
Διὸς θυγάτηρ τ’ Ἀφροδίτη. Plutarch
(Conjugalia Praecepta, Introd.) explains the
combination of Venus and Mercury and

the others thus, οἴ παλαιοὶ τῇ Ἀφροδίτῃ ¹

τὸν Ἑρμῆν συγκαθίδρυσαν ὥς τῆς περὶ
τὸν γάμον ἡδονῆς μάλιστα λόγου δεομένης,
τήν τε Πειθὼ καὶ τὰς Χάριτας ἵνα πείθον-
τες διαπράττωνται παρ’ ἀλλήλων ἃ βού·
λονται μὴ μαχόμενοι μηδὲ φιλονεικοῦντες.
