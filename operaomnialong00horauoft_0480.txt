64. Detrahere et v pellem] Compare
Epp. i. 16. 44:

“ Sed videt hunc omnis domus et vicinia.
tota

. Introrsum turpem, speciosum pelle de-
cora.”

Each of the Scipiones had a Laelius for
his intimate companion. This is C. Lae-
lius Sapiens, the friend of P. Scipio Afri-
canus Minor, and well known through
Cicero’s treatises ‘de Senectute' and ‘de
Amicitia,' in the former of which he is a
listener, in the latter the principiul speaker.
As to the following verse see C. iv. 8. 18 n.
[‘ Per ora cederet :³ Sallust, J ug. c. 31, has
‘incedunt per ora vostra‚' ‘they march be-
fore your faces 3’ and Ovid, Trist. iv. 2. 27 ε

“ Hos super in curru, Caesar, victore ve-
heris
Purpureus populi rite per ora tui.'']

67. Metello] Q. Caecilius Metellus, who
had the cognomen Macedonicus given him
*for his success against Andriscus, the
pretendcr to the throne of Perseus, was a
political opponent of Scipio; but it need
not be supposed it wason this account that
Lucilius satirized him. Horace's way of
mentioniug the subject is against that
supposition. He means to say Scipio and
Laelius were not offended at Lucilius’ wit,
nor feared it might turn upon themselves,
when they saw him attack Metellus. But
if Lucilius had done so because he was an
enemy of Scipio, that alone would be a
sufficient guarantee against his exercising
his wit in an offensive way upon his
friend, and Horace’s argument would

mean nothing. Metellus’ opposition to
Scipio in public life was conducted with·
out acrimony, as Cicero says (de Off. i. 25.

68. Impo] Who Lupus was is not cer-
tain. His name appears in many of the
fragments of Lucilius, and Persius writes
(S. i. 114), “Secuit Lucilius urbem, Te
Lupe, te Muci, et genuinum fregit in illisss’
The person most probably alluded to, as
Torrentius suggesta is L. Cornelius Len-
tulus Lupus, who was consul Amne. 598.
What he had done to provoke Lucilius’
satire we do not know, but Cicero has pre-
served a verse of his in which Lupus is
mentioned. “ Quid de sacrilegis, quid de
impiis periurisque dicemus i> ’ asks Cicero
(de Nat. Deorum, i. 23) 3 and he proceeds:

“ Tubulus si Lucius unquam,
Si Lupus, aut Carbo, aut Neptuni filius,

ut ait Lucilius, putasset esse Deos, tam
perjurus aut tam impurus fuisset Ρ ” where,
if Lucilius' verse was in aecordance with
Cicero’s argument, Lupus is classed with
the perjured and profligate.

-— Atqui primores populi] ‘Atqui'means
‘but he did, did he notP’ (S. i. 1. 19).
‘ Tributim,' throughout all the tribes: he
attacked the optimates and plebeians, und
all without distinction. ‘Aequus' means
‘ favour-able to?

72. Virtus Scipiadae] See v. 17, and
S. i. 2. 32 n. on the expression ‘virtus
Scipiadae‚' and compare J uv. iv. 81, “Ve-
nit et Crispi jucunda senectus? Laelius
had the cognomen Sapiens, and any one
who reads Cicero's treatise that bears his
name will understand Horace’s epithet
‘mitis.' Cruquius' Scholiast relates a
story of Laelius running round the dinner-
table, and Lucilius pursuing him with a
napkin to flog him. Lucilius was born
