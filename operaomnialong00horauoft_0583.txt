4. Veianius artui-r Here-lie ad postem]
Veianius was a maim-ius: and when he
was sdischarg ed he hung up his weapons in
the temple of Hercules just as the man is
made to hang up the arms of love in the
temple of Venus when they had ceased to
profit him, in C. iii. 26. 3 :—

“ Nunc arma defunctumque bello
Barbiton hie paries habebit :”

or as the slave hung up his chain to the
Lares (S. i. 5. 65 ιι., “Donasset jamne
catenam Ex voto laribus '’), to whom also
boys dedicated their · bulla’ when they as·
sumed the ⁴ toga virilis’ (“ Bullaque suc-
cinctis Laribus donata pependit,’' Pers. v.
31), and generally, as Turnebus remarks,
those who gave up any trade or calling
dedicated the instrumeuts with which they
had followed it to the gods and to that god

When gladiatore received their discharge
theytoe were presented by the‘ lanista' or the
›. tooespeeneulomm: who owned orhired

than. with a ‘rudis,’ which was a blunt

woodeu instrument, some say a sword‚
others a cudgel. There are two genis re-
preoenfingas it appears ‘rudiarii,’ in Ages-
ffifi’s collection, in each of which the man
carries a short round weapon like a police-
man' s truncheon. The name may have
belongedtonny weapo nused ιιι the‘ prae-
lmio’ or sham fig ht that generally pre-
ceded the real battle with sharp swords.
Suetonius says of Cahgul ahgula (c. 32): “Mir-
mmmmm e ludo rudibus secum batuentem
et sponte prostratum confodit ferrea sicas
and again (c. 54)· . “Batuebat pugnatoriis
armis.’' There were therefore different
non-ts of weapons used in this way, and
‘ rudis' may have been the name sor any
of them. The gladiators thus discharged
*were called ‘rudiarii,’ and if they were
freemen ‘exauctorati.’ (S. ii. 7. 59 ιι.)

‘Spectatum' is a technical term. Tickets

with the letters SP upon them were given
ιο gladiatore who had distinguished them·

selves. ‘’Ludus means the place where
the training took place and the gladiator-s

had placed themselves. Hercules would
naturally be chosen by a gladiator, or by a
soldier, as in an epigram in the Anthologia
(Brunck, vol. i. p. 254). Similar actions
are frequently represented ιιι those epi-
grama, as of a fisherman dedicating his
nets to the nymphs (vol. ii. p. 494), a
huntsman his nets and quiver to Mercury
(vol. i. p. 223), dcc. So the shepherd hangs
gp his flute on a tree to Pan (Tibullus ii.

“Pendebgitque vagi pastoris in arbore
¹ vo um,

Gari-ula silvestri fistula sacra de0.”

All the Scholiasts tell us that Veianius hung
up his weapons in the temple of Hercules
Fundanus, and it appears that Hercules was
worshipped particularly by the inhabitants
of Fundi in Latium (S. i. 5. 34). Orelli re-
fers to an inscription in his own collection,

No.1539;and Obbarius on this passage
quotes Vopiscus (Florianus, c. 4) as mak-

ing mention of the temple of Hercules Fun-

danus. He had at least one temple at
Rome (S. ii. 6. 12 ιι. ), and also at Tibur, '
which was called aster him. Veiania was
the name of an Italian family. Varro (R. R.
iii. 16.10) mentions two brothers of that
name from the Faliscus ager.
