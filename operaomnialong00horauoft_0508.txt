Sensit cum summam patrimoni insculpere saxo

Heredes voluit ⁸?

- HORATII FLACCI

Pauperiem vitium et cavit nihil acrius, ut si
Forte minus locuples uno quadrante perisset
Ipse videretur sibi nequior: omnis enim res,

Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque pulchris

Divitiis parent; quas qui construxerit ille

Clarus erit, fortis, justus.
Et quidquid volet.
Speravit magnae laudi fore.

Graecus Aristippus? qui-servos projicere aurum

In media jussit Libya, quia tardius irent

Propter onus seg-nes.

Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.
Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum,

Nec studio citharae nec Musae deditus ulli3

Staberius provided fox- is related in what
follows.

90. summam patrimoni] [‘ Patrimo-
nium ' often means no more than a pro-
perty or a man’s estate, as we call it.]

91. Quoad] Must be pronounced as a
monosyllable. On the formation of the
word sce Key’s L. G. 799.

93. perisset] This, which is the reading
of the Blandinian 81111 other good MSS„ is
probably the true one. The common read-
ing was ‘periret.' Bentley approves aud
argues for the pluperfect‚ but leaves ‘ pe-
riret ’ in the text. He quotes Terence
(Phorm. i. 2. 69), “Non si redisset ci pater
veniam daret ;’' and Adelph. ii. 1. 24, ‘⁶ Si
attigisses ferres infortunium ;’' and S. i. 6.
7 9. Staberius’ doctrine was that goodness
was measured by wealth, and that if he
should die poorer by 8 part of nn as, he
would, in the same proportion‚ bc in his
own esteem a less virtuous man.

97. Sapiensne ? Etiam, et rem] ‘Wisei’
say you. Aye, and a king to boot, and
any thing he shall please.' Some MSS.
omit ‘ct‚' but ‘ctiam' in replies means
‘even so! Compare Cic. Acad. Prior 32,
“Aut ctiam autnon, respondere possit,'’
⁸ yes or no.'

100. Graecus Aristippus] Aristippus
of Cyrene professed to be the slave of 110
passion, while he gratified all. He cared
nothing for money, while he used it for the
purpose of sensual indulgence. The story
Horace mentions is derived with little vu-
riation from Diog. Luci-t. (ii. 77), τοῦ θερά-

ποντος ἐν 11δῷ βαστάζοντος ἀργύριον καὶ
βαρυνομένου, ὥς φασιν οἱ περὶ τὸν Βίωνα
ἐν ταῖς διατριβαῖς, ἆπόχεε, ἔφη, τὸ πλέον
καὶ ὅσον δύνασαι βάσταζε.
18. 11.

103. litem quod lite resolvit] Which
settles one doubtful point by raising an-
other.

104. Si quis emat citharas] Sir Hem-y
Halford relates an instance of lunacy which
illustrates this: ‘⁴ In another well-known
case which justified the Lord Chanoellor’s
issuing a writ ‘ de lunatico inquirendo,’the
insanity of the gentleman manifested itself
in appropriating every thing to himself and
parting with nothing. When strongly
urged to put on 8 clean shirt he would do
it, but it must be over the dirty one 3 nor
would he put off his shoes when he went to
bed. He would agree to pure-base any
thing that was to be sold, but he would
not pay for it. He wne, in fact, brought
up from the King’s Bench prison, where
he had been committed for not paying for
8, picture valued at 1500 pounds which hc
had agreed to buy 3 aud in giving my opi—
nion to the jury 1 recommended them to go
over to his house in Portum-place, where
they would find 15,0002. worth of property
of every description ; this picture, musical
instrumente, clocks, baby-houses, and bau-
bleS, all huddled in confusion together on
the floor of his dining-room. Ι need not
add that the jury found the gentlemau in-
sane” (Halford's Essays p. 63).
