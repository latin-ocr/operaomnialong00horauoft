667

Ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,
Nostra sed impugnat, nos nostraque lividus odit.

Quod si tam Graecis novitas invisa fuisset

Quam nobis, quid nunc esset vetus ‘? aut quid haberet
Quod legeret tereretque viritim publicus usus ⁴?

Ut primum positis nugari Graecia bellis

Coepit et in vitium fortuna labier aequa,

Nunc athletarum studiis, nunc arsit equorum,

Marmoris aut eboris fabros aut aeris amavit,
Suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella,
Nunc tibicinibus‚ nunc est gavisa tragoedis;
Sub nutrice puella velut si luderet infans,

Quod cupide petiit mature plena reliquit.

Quid placet aut odio est quod ιιοιι mutabile credas Ρ
Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi.
Romae dulce diu fuit et sollemne reclusa

[92. viatim—amp Publicus usus' is

equivalent to the people who use-³ ‘viri-
tim,' ‘y,severall ’‘individually. ’]
98. Ut primm positis] Here follows

a description of the Athenians as they
quickly became aster the Persian War, and

that Horacc' s
apply. During theage of lyric poeti-y
which preceded that war, she had not a
⁷ poet of distinction. Her public buildings,
destroyed 1)] Xerxes, were rep laced by
others far more splendid a few years aster
the defeat of the Persians. Temples and
theatres were erected at enormous cost,
and ornamented by the genius of Pheidias
and others (architecta and sculptors) of
great renown. The coincidence which,
according to the general belief, associatos
the names of the three great tragedians
with the date of Salamis, marks that day
aa the commencement of a new career of
intellectual activity and social degeneracy
on the part of the Athenians. With the
of the drama came habits of idle-
ness3 with the possession of wealth rose
the taste for litigation and habits of extra-
vagance 3 with the thirst for knowledge
came in the teuching of sophistry; and
with political power arose the passinus of
the people and the influence of dema—
gogues. Little more than a century saw
the birth and extinction of this greatness.

95. athletarum studiis] The term

ἀθλητής (from ἆθλα, the prizes of victory)
was applied hythe Greeks only to those
who contended in the great games (the
Olymp ian, Isthmian, Nemean, and Py-

thian) for prizes iu exercises of personal

strength, as wresfflng, running, boxing,

leaping‚ throwing the quoit or javelin.
(ἡαπ honour was pffid to successful ‘ ath-
letae? They were introduced at Rome
about two centuries B.c.‚ and under the
emperors were a privileged class and
formed a ‘collegium.' (See Dict- Ant.

96. Ham-morie aut eboris fabros aut
aeris] All the great artists of this period,
as Pheidias, Polycleitus‚ Myron, wrought
in bronze as well as marble, and were
scarcely less distinguished for engraving
and chasing, than in the higher depart-
ments of art. The most celebrated works
in ivory were the statues of Jupiter Olym·
pius at Elis, and of Minerva in the Par-
thenon, executed by Pheidias. They were
chryselephantine.

101. Quid placet aut odio est] Horace's
argument against the favour-ers of the old
poets is this: ‘If the Greeks had been as
averse to what was new as some of us
appear to be, where would have been the
improvements that took place aster the
Persian wars P' Peace and prospe perity
brought with it tastes of a high order3
andug though there was ‘fickleness in the
pursuit of these things, this was to be ex-

pected, and may be excused, sceing what
human nature 13.
