SATIRARUM 1. 4. 361

ARGUMENT.

(irent was the liberty 'herewith those worthies of the Old Comedy set their mark upon
the vicima, aud them Lucilius has copied ς a man of wit and perception, but a harsh
vaviller 3 eariug less for the quality of his verses than the quantit„ full of words and
1⁰11 ol fulta, which he was too lazy to avoid. As to your quantity, 1 care not for
that, and when Crispinus challenges me at great odds to try which of us ean write
quiekesss Ι decline the invitation, and thank heaven that 1 am a man of quiet tem-
pua-ment and few words. He may go on puffing aud blowing like a pair οἰ bellows,

ς but that is not in my way.

.‘ (v. 21.) ramim gets a testimonial from his admirers, while no one will read what Ι

’ write (and 1 am too nervous to recite itin public), because men do not like to have

their faults exposed, and there are few who are not open to blame· Take any man

out of a croivd, he is avariciam, or ambitions, or lecherous, or he dotes upon fine plats
οι· fine statues, or is running about the world to make his fortune. All such are
afiaid of verses like mine, and hate those who write them. “Take care of him3 he
isdangemuu allhe cares for is to get npalaugh and amuse the old women and

-’ , children at the expenso of his friends?

(ν.,,88.) Nowlet me say a word in reply. In the first place 1 do not profess to be a
pst. six feet in a verse which otherwise is mere prose, this does not make a poet,
htgeuius, inspiratiou, aud sublime-language. And this has led some to question
whether comedy is poetry, seeing that the language aud ideas are all those of com-
m life. There are your fathers, for instance, seolding their sons, just as you may
'hur every day; moreover you may shuffle the words as you please in true poetry
without alter-ing the sense, but that is not the case with Lucilius’ language and mine
(you must read it as you would prose, or you make nonsense of it).

(v. oe.) But this question Ι may discuss elsev‘ffiere. My present purpose is to show that
youhave no reason to be afraid of this sort of writing. 'rhem are your informers
who go about and are the terror of all regnes: the honest man may daepise them.

y , But, even supposing you are the rogue, Ι am no informer. Ι have no daeire to have

⁵ . my books thumbed by the vulgar, or to read them to any but my friends, and that

oely when ptest. There are many 1 grant you who bawl their verses in the forum
aa} in the public haths, but they are mere blockheads. “ But we know you love to
moy, and do it with malicious inteut.'’ How can γοα charge me with this ? Nay,

- nn man who slanders his friend behind his back, or fails to defend him from the

“’ a dmderof others, who aims only at being called a wit, who inventa falsehood and
hhhs secreta, that man is a scoundreh let every honoet citizen avoid him. I have

> osten been at table when one of the company has amused himself with breaking his
wit upon the guests, not sparing the host himself when he gete warm ; now this man

J you look upon as a funny fellow, while for my innocent satire 1 am called malignant,

matie, and so forth. When your friend Petillius is mentioned you defend him

aster your own fashion, that is, you damn him with a sneer, the veriest poison, which

,η shall never be found, if I know myselfat all, in any thing Ι may write.

· γ (v. los.) If I have spoken alittletoofreely of others, 1 may bepardoned on this ground ε

” my excellent father always taught me by examples. If he would have me live fru-

gally, he would say, “ Look at the misery to which our friend Albius’ son and Barrus

, have reduced themselves by their extravagance.” When he would keep me from bad

’ ’ meri, “Take Scetanius for awarning.” “See what soendal attaches to Trebonius?

“wiser men may teach you by precept and theory: my care shall be ω watch over

your practice till you are able to take care of yourself.” If he would have me do

mething that was right, he would take one of the judiees and say, “There is an
example for you.’' On the other hand, if he would prevent ‘me from doing something
