Pars hominum gestit conducere publica, sunt qui
Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras,

Nullus in orbe sinus Baiis praelucet amoenis,

80. Vm esto aliie alios] But allow
different men their different tastes, yet even
this in of no use; for the same men when
they become rich are capricious, and are
always chmging their minda. If the rich
mnu has set his beart upon buildiug a house
ut Baiae, he does not brook a momeut's
delayz the waters of the Lacus Lucrinus
ou oueside, and the sea ou the other, are
‹listins-bed with the eager preparations with
wlu’ch the rich man begins to satisfy his
deire. The allusion is the same asin C.

Bai-e was for several generations a favour-

itermoet of the wealthy Romans. C. Julius

(ha-1· had a house there, and also Cn. Pom·

‘⁷‘ ( Martial, writing long after Horace,
ιί. 80) :—

* Ut mine laudem, icce, versibus Baias,
laudabo digne non satis tamen Baias.''

Ἡιο warm springs werea great attraction.
Horace alludes to them in Epp. i. 15, where
he says the physiciau has forbidden his
goingto Baiae. The Lucrinus Lacus, which
was an arm of the sea, has been filled up
b the rising of the voleauic hill called

onte Nuovo in the middle of the six-
toenth century. [‘ Prospectabatque (insula
Capreae) pulcherrimum sinum antequam
Vesuvius mons ardescens faciem loci ver-
teret? Tacit. Ann. iv. 67, quoted by
Bitia-3] Teanum (now Teano) was atown
oe cffiffintgfhff fflfflfflssssfflffff {³1¹3
Iuntina, and about thirty miles from Baiae.
Some very ancient coins with Oscan cha·
racters ou them have been found on the
site of this town. The whim for the coast
having vanished, and a desii-eto live inland
iu a country town having seized upon the
man of money, he sends off the workmen
with their tools to Teanum at a day's no·

tice. ‘Vitiosa libido ’ means ι corrupt,
capricious will, which is said ‘facere auspi·
cium,’ to stand in the place of birds and
other omens usually consulted before new
enterprises were andex-taken.

87. Lectae yenialie in aula est] ‘Aula'
means the ‘atrium ς’ and ‘ lectus genialis,’
also called ‘ adversus,’ because it was oppo-
site the door, was the marriage-bed, which
was dedicated to the genii of the bride and
bridegroom. If the man married a second
time the bed was changed. Propertius
(iv. 11. 85) :—

“ Seu tamen adversum mutarit janua
Sedeecifizlejt nostro cauta noverca toro,
Conjplglimuni, pueri, laudate et ferte pater-

Gellius (xvi. 9) quotes from the compitalia
of Laberius :—

“ Nunc tu lentus es: nunc tu susque deque

Mgtgs'rfamilias tua inlecto adverso sedet.”

Virgil’s line (Aen. vi. 603), “Lucent ge-
nialibus altis flul-ea fulcra toris,’' which is
usually quoted in this place, does not refer
to the marriage-bed, but to banquets in
honour of the genii, such as the Romans
celebrated on their birthdays and at other
times. (C. iii. 17. 14.) The bed was a
symbol of domestic love and peace, and
was placed where it was for a omen.
Juvenal says (S. vi. 21): “Antiquam et
vetus est—sacri genium contemnere lecti‚''
to describe the profligacy of mankind from«
the age of gold downwards. Lucan de-
scribes it as “gradibus acclivis eburnis’'
(Phars- ii. 356). Respecting the genii, see
Epp. i. ’1. 94; ii. 2. 187. [‘Bene esse
maritis ι’ See C. iii. 16. 43 n.]
