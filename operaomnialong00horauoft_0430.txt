good and bad. In the former she is re-
presented by Honos.

24. Quo tibi, Tuli] Comp. Epp. i. 5.
12. The Scholiasts Acron and Comm.
Cruq. say that this person, whose name
is Tulli in some MSS. and editions, was
a senator, and was degraded by C. Julius
Caesar as being of Pompeius' party 3 that
he was reinstated after Caesar's death, and
was made a military tribune. One Tillius
Cimber is mentioned by Plutarch (Caesar,
0. 66) among the conspirators against
Caesar. Whether or not this Tillius is
different from the person mentioned bc-
low, v. 107, it is not easy to say. Estre
denies, Orelli and others affirm, that he is
” the same. There is not much to guide
us. Each legion had six tribunes, and
Horace was a tribune in the army of
Brutus (v. 48; C. ii. 7). The military
tribunes of the first four legions were
entitled to sit in the senate. (Epod. iv.
15 n.) As to the ‘latus clavus,' see note
on the 34th verse of the last Satire.
‘Quo,’ ‘to what purpose? (O. ii. 3. 9
n.

)27. Nam ut quisque insanus] The
senators' ‘calceus,' an out-door shoe, was
fastened by four thongs, two on each side,
which went spirally up to the calf of the
leg (medium crus). These thongs were
called ‘corrigiae‚’ and were black. The
shoe itself appears to have varied in
colour. Juvenal (vii. 192) says of Quin-
tilianus: “appositam nigrae lunam Sub-
texit alutae,'’ where the ‘ aluta ' is a shoe
made of leather softened in a solution of
alum, and the colour is black. It also
bears something in the shape of a crescent

‘luna’ (Ruperti says a. buckle), which
Philostratus (Vita Herod. ii. 8) calls σύμ-
βολον τῆς εὐγενείας-ἐπισφύρων (it must
therefore have been worn as high as the
ancle) ἐλεφάντινον μηνόειδες. Martial
calls it “lunata pellis” (i. 50. 31), and

again (ii. 29. 7 sq.) =

“ Non hesterna sedet lunata lingula
planta,
Coggipan non laesum cingit aluta pe-

where the shoe is purple or dark red.
Such a shoe was the ‘mulleus.' Becker

refer, as this passage of Horace clearly
does, only to the striugs. (Gallus, Exc.
‘Male attire.') If 50, the string was of
the same leather as the 51100, and passed
over the‘ luna, ' which was perhaps on the
outer side of the foot.

29. [Audit continuo] Literally, ‘forth-
with he hears;’ that' 15, ‘forthwith these
are the' mquiries made about him. Com-
pare S. ii. 6. 203 7. 101, and Epp. i. 16.

—]- Quis homo hic est ? quo] The MSS.
vary between this reading and ‘hic, et
quo’ and ‘hic, aut quo.' The editors
differ. The reading 1 have followed (aster
Lambinus, Orelli, and others) seems well
suited to the remark and question sup-
posed.

30. quo morbo an-rus] His disease ³

was a thirst for admiration among wo-
men. He is said by the Scholiasta Por-
phyrion and Commy Cruq. to have de-
bauched Aemilia, a Vestalq virgin. “Certo
adulteras sincerissima cupiditate secta-
batur'’ Porphyrion says, in a tone which
shows he had some known person in his
mind. Aemilia was found guilty of un-
chastity (incestum), together with two
other Vestals, Marcia and Licinia, A.U.c.
640. (Liv. Epit. 63.) Plutarch mentions
the circumstance (Quaest. Rom. 83), and
says that among the persons accused was
one Βουτέτιος βάρβαρος, which Fabricius
has corrected into Βετούτιος Βάῤῥος, Betu-
tius Barrus, which may be the correct,
reading The Scholiasts’ 111 all probability
had regad of this Barrus, and confounded
Horace' s coxcomb with him. There was a
T. Betucius Barrus, a distinguished orator
of Asculum, who is mentioned by Cicero
(Brutus, c. 46). Τ110 name, therefore, is
a real one, but it does not follow that
Horace might not mean somebody of a
different name. Orelli assumes him to be
the same as the person mentioned in S. 4.
110 as reduced to poverty‚ and adds, “ be-
