Caelibis obsequium nudet te, leniter in spem
Adrepe officiosus, ut et scribare secundus
Heres et, si quis cesus puerum egerit oren,

In vacuum venias: perraro haec alea fallit.

Qui testamentum tradet tibi cunque legendum,
Abnuere et tabulas a te removere memento,
Sic tamen ut limis rapias quid prima secundo

domham ac tollerem? [‘ Validus male :³

Cicero (Topie. 10 ς de Or. i. 39) speaks of
L. Crassus: “agens de eo qui testamento

No son was born, and the next of kin dis·
puted the right of the ‘ secundus heres’
because he was appointed to sueoeed 111 the
event of the supposed son dying before he
could come ‘in tutelam suam? This was
called ‘ pupillaris substitutio: and may be
referredtob Horacein this place. [Gaius,
ii. 5 1⁷4, substitutionibus] (Dict.

testator’s name appeared in the first line of
the first page, and aster his came thom of
the ‘heredes' Suetonius thus describes
the will of C. Julius Caesar (c. 83): “No-
vissimo testamento tres instituit heredes
sororum nepotoe, C. Octavium ex dodrante,
et L. Pinarium et Q. Pedium ex quadrante
reliquo: in ima cera C. Octavium etiam in
familiam nomenque adoptavit: pluresque

in secundis heredibus. Populo hortos circa

therefore, if the text is correct (as 1 believe
it to be, though Lipsius has altered it), ap·
peared the names of all but the ‘primi
heredes' (that is, the ‘ legatarii’ and ‘sub-
stituti ')‚ together with the general provi-
sions of the wilh Martial (iv. 70) :—
