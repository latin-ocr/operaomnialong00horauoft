586 HORATII FLACCI

deserving in proportion to the goodness of my benefactor. But if you will
have me always live at Rome, give me back the strength and cheerfulness
of my youth.

Α little fox chanced to get through a cranny into a vessel of corn, and whenv
he had eaten his fill tried to get out, but could not. “Lean you went in and
to leanness you must return if you would get out,” said a weasel hard by. If any
one says the same to me, I am ready to give up all. 1 don't praise the repose and
freedom of the country while Ι have my belly full of dainties. I would not exchange
it for the wealth of Arabia. You have often witnessed and commended my reverence
for you, and have heard me call you my father and my king; but see if Ι cannot
cheerfully restore all you have given me. Well did Telemachus reply when Menelaus
offered him horses: “ Ithaca hath no room for horses, son of Atreus 3 thy gitts
are more suitable for thine own keeping, and there I leave them.” 1 am a humble
man: I love not the splendours of Rome, but the ease of Tibur and the softness of
Tarentum.

When Philippus, that stout orator, was returning home from the Forum, tired and

out of spirits, he saw one sitting in a barber's shop lazily paring his nails= ‘Go,’
said he to his slave, ‘go and find out who that man is, and all about him.' He
proves to be one Mena, a crier, of small means and good character, and well known
as an active, sensible man, well content with his condition. ‘ I should like to hear
all this from himself : invite him to dine with me.’ The man can hardly believe his
ears: however he begs to be excused. Philippus was surprised, but next morning
saw the man at an auction and repeated his invitation, and it was accepted. The
dinner went off agreeably, and was often repeated till the man became an esta-
'blished guest. One holiday he went with his patron into the country, and was
dclighted with all he saw. Philippus saw an opening for a joke, and persuaded
the man to buy himself a piece of ground. 'ro make a long story short, he was
soon turned into a farmer, talked of nothing but husbandry, and worked himself to
death. Then come losses: his sheep are stolen, his goats get the rot, his crops
fail, his steers are worn out, till he can stand it no longer, but mounts his horse and
rides off to Philippus, and entreats him by all he holds sacred tq restore him the life
he has lost.

And so let every man do who has found out that he has made a bad exchange. Let
him go back to his first estate 5 and let each take care to measure himself by his

own standard.
