Et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praecepte,
Utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri
Sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis.

Carmine qui trag-ico vilem certavit ob hircum,

Moretiam agrestas Satyros nudavit, et asper
Incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit, eo quod
Illeoebris erat et grata novitate morandus
Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces

⁴225

Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria ludo,
Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,

Regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,
Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,

Aut dum vitat humum nubes et inania captet.

[218. divina-futuri] ‘ Prophetic of the
futuro: like an oracle. Comp. C. iii. 27. 10.]

“The name of Tragedy (goat's song) was
evm lhlyfflthe Osanttiients derived 1:3111 {he
ruem ce e smgers ιιι eir c a·
raeter of Satyrs to goats. Yet the slight
resemblance in form between Satyrs and
gnata could hardly have given a name to
this kind of poetry = it is far more probablc
that this specim of dithyramb was originally
performed at the burnt sacrifice of a goat''

fuller, p. ml). Δ goat was the prize

the dioral songs or dithyrambs to which
the name τραγῳδία first belonged. Bentley
(PhaL p. 161) supposes the name to have
been derived from the prize, but denies
that it existed before the time of Thespis.
(See below, v. 275 n.) The chorus appeared
in the character of Satyrs as attendants on
Dionysus, at whose festival they performed.
Their subjecta were originally confined to
the adventures, serious and spurt-ive, of
tlut god, and therefore were a mixture of
mirth and gravity. Choerilus, an older
contemporary of Aeschylus-seems to have
laid the foundation of an independent Sa—
tyric Drama, the entire separation of which
from tragedy‚ as we now understand the
word, was effected a few years later by
Pratinas of Phlius in Argolis, about nc.
5oe3‚thenceforward it was usual for the
tragic poets to exhibit four plays at a time
(tetralogies)‚ of which the fourth was a
Satyric Drama, such as the Cyclops of
Euripides. The following remarks will ex-
plain most of this passage :—“ The Satyric
Drama was *not a comedy, but a playful
tragedy. Its subjects were taken from the

230

same class of adventures of Bacchus and
the heroes as tragedy; but they were so
treated in connexion with rude objects of
outward nature that the presence and par·
ticipation of rustic petulant Satyrs seemed
quite appropriate. Accordingly all scenes
from free nntamed nature, adventures of a
striking character, where strange monsters
or savage tyrants of mythology are over-
come by valour or stratagem, belong to
this class; and in such scenas as these the

could express various fcelings of
terror and denght, disgust and desire, with
all the openness and nnreserve which belong
to their character. All mythical subjects
and characters were not therefore suited to
the Satyric Drama. The character best
suited to it seems to have been the power-
ful hero Hercules, an eater and drinker
and boon companiun, who, when he is in
good humour, allows himself to be amused
by the petulant sports of Satyrs and other
similar elves'’ (Mulier, p. 294 sq.).

[222. Incolumi yram-itate] The writer
still preserved the dignity of the chief cha-
racters in the Satyris Drama]

224. potus et exlex] This expresses the
frecdom which attended the Dionysiae
festivals aster the sacrifiees were over.

[225. risores] The Satyrs, who said and
did laughable things. ‘Vertere
1 know nothing
C. i. 35. 4.]

228. auro nuper et ostro] ‘ He who
but now came forward in gold and purple
(which ornaments gods and heroes wore),
let him not pass into low language as if he
were a frequenter of taven-ns?

230. nubes et inania captet] Compare
Persius (v. 7): “ Grande locuturi nebulas
