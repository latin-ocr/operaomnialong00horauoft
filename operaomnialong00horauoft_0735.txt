’ omits what be cannot adom, sud so puts his fictions together that there is no incon-
sistency throughout.

(v. 158.) 11 you want your plsy to succeed you must study the characters of
different ages: your child must be thoughtless and playfuh your youth fond of
mauly sports, open to tsmptation, intoleraut of advice, improvident, sspifing, and
ως your full-grown man must be cautious, looking for money and friends and
ndvsucsment ς while your old man is surrounded with troubles, avariciam, nervous,
sold, procrastinating, slow of hope, sluggish‚ greedy of life, morose, qnerulous,
oommsnding the former days, s reprover of youth. For sear then of mixing up the
different periods of life, we should fix attention upon the characterismos of each.

(v. 1⁷9.) The events must either pass upon the stage, or be told after they are over.

- what is seen makes more impression than what is heard ς but still horrors and incre-
dibls marvels are not to be transacted on the stage. A play should be in five acts.
No god should be brought in without necessity. No fourth person shouldbe allowed
to spesk. The chorus should second the speakers, and should not sing what is irrele-
vmt. It should favour and counsel the good, calm the passionate, commend
temporanee, justice, obedience to the laws, and peace3 keep secrets and offer prayer-s
to tho gods for mercy to the sfflicted and vengeanee on the tyrant.

(v. m.) Once the flute was a plain instrument made for the use of the chorus, and not
to fill great thestres, as now. But this simple music changed when conquest and
luxury mixed up country and town. Then the flute-plsyer strutted on the stage,
and the lyre was tuned to solemn sounds, to passionate eloquence, or oracular strains.

(v. zm.) Soon after Tragedy came the Saty-ric Drama, when fun and gravity were
separated, and the spectator-s in the licence of the honr were treated with fresh jokes
andnovelties. But in these plays too there must be no inconsistencies, such as a god
or hero coming down to tavern-slnng or losing himself in fustian. Tragedy should
move like a modest and stately matmxramong the Satyrs. For 1 would not banish
tragic language altogether, so that Silenus the god should talk in the same stmin
ss Davus the slave. I would adopt a familiar style, so that any one should think he

ν could do it ss well till he came to try. Pauus must neither talk like city beaux nor

’Π - use low language, lest they offend the better sort, though the vulgar may applaud.
(v. 251.) A short syllable followed by along make an iambus, the rapidity of which

made the senarius pass for s trimeter. At sust all the feet were iambi, till to give
more steadiness to the verse spondees were admitted in the uneven feet. Accius and
Ennius nearly banished the iambus altogether. This is a blot in them, but it is not
every one that can teu good versification from bad. Shau I presume upon this Ρ or
shall 1 write cautiously, as if every fault would be detected Ρ Thus might I escape
blame, but should win no praise.

(v. 268.) 'Pake the Greeks for your models and study them.

Why, your fathers used to admire both the rhythm and the wit of Plautus.

Yes, stupidly enough, if we know the difference between coarseness and wit, and cun
scen a verse.

(v. 276.) Thespis is said to have invented Tragedy, travelling about with his waggon,
and his actors smeared with wine lees. Then came Aeschylus with mask, robe,
cothurnus, and stage, and taught them to speak grandly. Aster these the old
comedy‚ which was highly approved, till licence was abused, and the law stepped in
and silenced the chorus. Our poeta have been bold enough sometimes to quit the
Greek and celebrate home tales in tragedy and comedy, and if they were more diligent,
Latium would be as mighty in literature as in arms. Oh! my friends, have nothing

'to say to a poem which does not show marks of care and correction.

(v. 295.) Because genius is above art, and all poets, according to Democritus, are mad,

mnuy let their nails and beard grovv, affecting madness. Fool that 1 am to get rid
