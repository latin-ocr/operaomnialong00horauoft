220 HORATII FLACCI·

OARMEN II.

aare. 7 38.

The fortunes of Iulus Antonius, son of the triumvir M. Antonius by his wife Fulvia,
his rise and tragical end, do not concern this ode. He was a man of letters and a pupil
of L. Crassitius, a grammarian who kept a school at Rome, to which many sons of the
noble families were sent. He received therefore a good education, and we have it on the
authority of the Scholiasts that he wrote an heroic poem on the fortunes of Diomedes in
twelve books, besides some prose works. Acron says that his poem was excellent; but,
as it is not likely he ever saw it, his testimony is not worth much. (See Heyne, Exc.
Aen. x. 243.) Horace pays him the compliment of saying that he could celebrate
Augustus' victories much better than himself, but this he said to Maecenas (O. ii. 12.
11) ; and, though from that passage and this we may believe that Maecenas wrote prose
and Antonius poetry, the quality of either and the subjects cannot be inferred from any
data. Horace has given πε. Because we know nothing of Antonius’ poetica] powers ex-
cept from this ode, and because of the distance between the two names, ‘ Iule' (v. 2) and
‘Antoni ' (v. 26), some critics have changed ‘ Iule ’ into ‘ Ille’ (Peerlkamp. in loco
Eichstadt. Paradox. Horat. i. p. 9), and supposed ‘ Antoni ' to mean Antonius Rufus,
who is mentioned by Acron (on A. P. 289) and Comm. Cruq. as one who wrote comedy3
but the existence of such a person is very doubtful, though Suetonius mentions a gram-
marian of that name, and Ovid speaks of one Rufus who wrote lyric poetry aster the
manner of Pindar (Ex Pont. iv. 16. 27 sqq.) z

“ Et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida vertit3 et una
Pindaricae fidicen tu quoque, Rufe, lyrae.”

But there is no reason to suppose his name was Antonius. In A.U.c. '738 the Sigambri,
with two other German tribes, crossed the Rhine aud laid waste part of the Roman
territory in Gaul. They defeated the legate Lollius, and this disaster was sufficient to
induce Augustus (Dion Cass„ 54. c. 19, intimates that he had other reasons, especially
his persona] unpopularity at Rome and his intrigues with Terentia, which is mere
gossip) to go in person to Gaul, which he did, and at his approach the. Germans with-
drew into their own territories, and giving hostages obtained peace. The defeat of Lol-
lius had caused great consternation at Rome, and the news of the barbarians’ subjection
was hailed with proportionate joy. Augustus did not return for two years to Rome,
having meanwhile restored order in Germany, Gaul, and Spain; but it is probable this
ode was written in the expectation of his return, and while the news respecting the
Sigambri was still fresh, that is to say, about the end of A.U.c. 738. Augustus’ return
to Rome was expected long before it took place (see C. 5 of this book). The general
impression derived from the ode is that Antonius had pressed Horace to write a poem in
honour of Augustus’ victory in the style of Pindar’s ἐπινίκια, and that he very wisely
declined, though his friend Titius (Epp. i. 3. 10) was more bold, and Rufus above men·

tioned was so too.
ARGUMENT.

Whoso would rival Pindar must expect Icarus' fate. His numbers roll like a swollen

river. His is the bay, whether he tune the dithyramb or sing of gods and heroes, of
victors or of women bereaved. The swan of Dirce soars to the clouds: Ι am but as a
bee sipping the flowers of Tibur. Thou, Antonius, shalt sing of the triumphs of
Caesar, greatest and best, and of the holiday rejoicings that hail his return: and 1
will add my small voice to thine: and we will all sing songs of triumph and will

sacrifice, thou with bulls aud cows, 1 with a young heifer.
