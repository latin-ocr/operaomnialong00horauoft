Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.

Damnati populo paria atque epulum arbitrio Arri,

83. Nescio aa Anticyram] On the
phrases ‘nescio an,’ ‘haud scio an‚' Ἰ
incline to think it is so,' see Key's,L. G.

Corinthiacus, and was celebrated for helle-

* · bore, a medicine used very generally in

mnas of madness. It would seem pro·
hable from ver. 166 and other places that
peinis went to reside at Anticyra some-
times- 'l'he modern name is Aspra Spitia,

pheos or the name (Strabo, pp. 418. 434),

which is said to have produced helleboro.
whether the number three can be sup-
ported by Δ. P. 300, “ Si tribus Anticyris
caput inmahile nunquam,” is more than
doubtful (see n.). ‘ Destinare,’ Orelli says,
is a medical term for prescribing.

84. Staberi] There is no information
¹ about this person in the Scholiasta. 'I'he
ι ” of Arrius was Quintus (below,

ver. 243, “Quinti progenies Arri par
nobile fratrum ’'), and he is known from
sienni allusions in Cicero. He was the

Verres wanted to succeed him (in

err. ii. 2. 15), being a person of like
mind with himself, and of the ,lowest
⁶ ⁸ . See Brut. c. 69, where he is said
to an instance how, in those days as
in these, without learning or talent and
by time-serving‚ a man might rise

to honour and wealth. He was praetor
in Asty-c. 682 (Liv. Epit. 96), and stood
for the consulship A.U.c. 695, but was
rejected (Cic. ad Att. ii. 7). He gave a
great funeral entertainment, which is
mentioned by Cicero in his h'in
Vatinium, c. 12. He there calls him
“familiaris meus,” which raises a doubt
whether he is the person mentioned in
the Brutus. If the Schol. Gronov. in
(Xe. Divin. is right, the Arrius of A.v.c.
⁶95 was the son of the praetor. The
exhibitioni of gladiatore was originally a
funeral ceremony, and so continued aster

the practice became common as a popular
entertainment. Aster the funeral of a
wealthy man a distribution of meat to
the people (‘ visceratio ') was not nn-
common, and a public banquet (‘ epulum ¹)
was very common, to which persons of the
highest distinction that the friends could
get to attend were invited. The distri-
bution of corn (‘ frumentatio ’) was also
a cotgurigdn ξηρῆς». Thi} Stabaius, 11ῗὲ

were, by a condition in his testament,
‘damnati,' under a penalty, to celebrate

*his funeral with gladiator-inl shows and an

epulum on a scale to be determined by
Arrius, which would be an extravagant
scale. ‘Damnati' is a legal term, and
penalties were common in Roman wills3
[and they occur in monumental inscrip-

*tions, as in this form, ⁸ Si quis . . hoc sepul-

crum . . vendere vel donare voluerit dare
damnas esto aerario &cl (Orelli). ‘ Dam-
natio' was also a Roman form of giving
a legacy (Gaim, iii. 197. 201)]. We must
infer from the text that 200 pairs of
gladiators were in Horaoe’s day an extra-
vagant number, but in later times it
would not ,have been excessive. “Fru-
menti quantum metit Africa” is a pro-
verbial expression, see C. i. 1. 10. As to
‘patruusss see C. iii. 12. 3, and above,
S. 2. 97. Compare Peisius (iii. 96), “ Ne
sis mihi tutor.” [‘ Sive ego . . . patruus
mihi :' these words express the thoughts

of Staberius; ‘ Whether I have done
wrong or right in putting the condition

89. Prudentem] Cicero (in a fragment
quoted by Porcell.) defines ‘prudentia’
thus: “Sapientis est pavidae, a quo sa-
pientia eet appellata prudentia? What
