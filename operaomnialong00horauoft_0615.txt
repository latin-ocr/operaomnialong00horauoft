aa fiir as Capua had country houses belong-

therefore would frequently be seen on the
via Appia. ‘Numa quo devenit et Ancus'
is a! plrgrverbial way of speaking. See C.
iv. . n.

28. Si latus mat renes] The connexion
will be seen in the Argument. On ‘fortis’

‘ Putas’ is more in Horace’s way than
³ putes‚’ which Bentley thinks “ mollius et
verecundius? and adopts from some MSS„

to some divinity, and Horace means per-

do not feel sure that such is Horace’s
meaning. ‘ Lucus' was sometimes used
indifferently for any wood‚ and Horace may
menn ‘ if you think virtue consists only of
-words as a grove does of trees ;’ in which
cue ‘ut’ wouldbe better than· ‘et-,⁹ though
'‘ et ’ would do. [⁴ Virtutem—putas ' is an
hypothetical clause: ‘ if you think that
virtue is only words-³ So is ‘vis recte
vivere?

32. ἕποι’ ne portus occupet alter] As to
⁸ occupo' see C. ii. 12. 28n. Horace says,
“ if you think lightly of virtue as t2.e
means of happiness, be active and make
moneyz see no one gets into harbour be-

’ fore you to carry off the business before you
‘arrivess' He supposes him to be a ‘ nego-
'tiator’ (S. i. 7, 1nt.). The business of
‘negotiatores’ was chiefly banking and
money-lending,but they also engaged in
mercantile transactione, the difference be-
tween them and ‘mercatores’ being that
the latter travelled with their own ware8‚

while the ‘ negotiatores ’ did business in a
general way. Cibyra Major (Horzoom)
was situated on a branch (now called Hor·
zoom Tchy) of the Indus, on the north-west
borders of Lycia (Spratt’s Lycia, vol. i. p.
256). It was called ‘ major ’ to distinguish
it froin a smaller town on the coast of Pam-
phylia. Twenty-five towns belonged to
the conventus of Cibyra. Bithynia, aster it
became a Roman province. included a great
part of Pontus, and so compr-ised nearly the
whole sea-coast of Asia Minor on the
Euxine. The trade therefore must have
been very great, since the Halys alone must
have brought down vast quantities of mer-
chandise, and there were other navigable
nivers, as the Lycus, Iris, Parthenius, San·
garius‚ communicating with the interior.
lt had also convenient harbours on the
Propontis, and was only separated from
Europe by the narrow Thracian Bosporus·
The mountains produced valuable minerals
and precious stones and marbles of differ-
ent kinds. The names Thyni and Bithyni
originally represented two different peoples
of Thrace who mig-rated into this part of
Asia and displaced the native tribes. They
remained distinct for some time, but at
this time the distinction was not observed;
therefore Horace speaks of ‘ Thyna merx’
(C. iii. 7. 3), where he means generally
Bithynian. ‘ Negotia ’ is commonly used
for the business transactions of a ‘negoti-
ator,’ as Cicero, in his letter introducing
Manlius Sosis to Acilius, proconsul of Sicily
(ad Fam. xiii. 30), says, “ habet negotia
vetera in Sicilia sua.'’ He had debts to get
in, and accounts of old standing to settle.
34. Mille talenta rotundentur] On
‘talenta ² see S. ii. 7. 89 ιι. ‘ Rotundare ’
is not used in this sense elsewhere. Petro-
nins uses ‘ eoi-rotundare: and the meaning
is the same as ours when we talk of a round
number ε it is a complete number, leaving
out fractions. ‘ Porro' means ‘fax-ther:
‘ Quadrat acervum,’ ‘ makes the fourth
side of the square? as it were. ·.
