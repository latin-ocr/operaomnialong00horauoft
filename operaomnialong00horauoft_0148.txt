It does not follow that Maecenas ever wrote
or that Horace ever seriously intended to
advise his writing. ‘ Pedestribus ’ is an
adaptation of the Greek πεζὸς λόγος for
‘ prosa,’ or ‘ soluta oratio‚' which latter
was the usual expression for prose in
Horace's time. He uses the word ‘ pedes-
again twice to express a plain style of
speech, but not for prose as opposed to
poetry (S. ii. 6. 17) : “ Quid prius illustrem
satiris musaque pedestri 1²⁹³ and (A. P. 95)
“tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedes-
tri.'' Quintilian uses the word, but ex-
pressly as a Graecism. The word ‘prosa,’
or ‘ prorsa‚' as the correct form appears to
be, is of later use than the age of Augustus.

11. ductaque per vias] See C. i. 2. 49;
iv. 2. 35 n. Epod. vii. ¹7.

12. minacium] The MSS. vary between
‘minacium' and ‘ minantium‚’ which words
might easily be confounded through the
omission of the mark usually substitutcd
for ‘n ' in the latter, ‘minatiumss But
the participle would signify that they were
now threatening, which would perhaps be
out of character, though Jani thinks ‘mi-
nantium' very graphio: “Quam graphicum
hoc !'' Jani is abundant in exclamation.
Bentley quotes Ovid (Trist- iv. 2. 21 sqq.):

“ Vinclaque captiva reges cervice gerentes
Ante coronatos ire videbit equos.
Et cernet vultus aliis pro tempore versos,
Terribiles aliis, immemoresque sui.”

‘ Minax ¹ is a favourioe word with Horace.

13. dominae] If by Licymnia is meant
Terentia (see Introduction), ‘dominae’ may
stand for wife, as in Virg. (Aen. vi. 397) :
‘⁶ Hi dominam Ditis thalamo deducere
adorti.'’ See Conington’s note. Ovid (Trist.
iii. 3. 23): “ Nuntiet huc aliquis dominam
venisse, resurgam 3⁷³ and again in the forty-
first verse :—

20*

“Nec dominae lacrimis in nostra enden-
Accedleliiizsffimae tempora parva mese ἶν’

So ‘amans:' “vana spe lusit amntem”
(Aen. i. 352), Bentley edits ‘dulcisl
but quotes the line with ‘dulces‚' which
he preferred therefore is plain; audit is
likely that the transcribcrs who wrote
‘dulcis' meant it for ‘dulceis‚’ the accu-
sative case. ‘ Cantus' wants an epithet.
14. lucidum Fulgentes] Dillenbr. says
the neuter adjective is used adverbially in
phrases like this, where there is to be ex-
pressed of the subject not only what it is
but what it does. In this place he says
“oculi tantopere fulgent nt lucere vide-
antur.’' I do not quite see the distinction.
Had he said “tantopere lucent nt fulgere
videantur‚” it might be su that he
meant that the eyes shonc so, they seemcd
to cast forth lightning, ‘fulgere' being
equivalent to ‘ fulgorem emittere.’ In ‘tur-
bidum laetatur’ (C. ii. 19. 6) the remark
is more clearly verified, since there he who
ssffiif‘izii *a ΨΒ) methema:
27. 67), she who smiles is also sweet or
roguish, and so on in ‘ gratum elocuta’
(iii. 3. 17), ‘ resonarent triste' (S. 28» 41),
διο. The neuter adjective only pen-forms
in these cases the office of an adverb, which
is common in all languages. [⁶ Bene fidum ε’
so Vix-gil, Aen. ii. 23, has ‘male fida-’J
20. Dianae celebris die] Her festival
was held on the ides of August. 'rho
dances at her festival were led by ladies of
rank (O. iv. 6. 313 A. P. 232). This and
the use of ⁶ dedecuit ' shows that the per·
son intended by Licymnia was not as some
suppose a mistress of Horace. To such a
person the notion of being disgraced by
dancing at a private house would not apply.
‘Choris’ appears to be opposed to the sacred?
