Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem

HORATII FLACCI

180

Quam quae sunt oculis subJ'ecta fidelibus, et quae
Ipse sibi tradit spectator: non tamen intus
Digna geri promes in scenam, multaque tolles
Ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praesens.

Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet,

185

Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus,
Aut in avem Procne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.
Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.
Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu

Fabula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi,

190 .

Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus
Inciderit ; nec quarta loqui persona laboret.

180. Segnius irritant animos] When
Candaules proposes to exhibit his wife's
beauty to Gyges, Herodotus (i. 8) makes
him say, ὦτα ’γὰρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώποισι
ἐόντα ἄπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, and Seneca
(Epp. vi.) has a. like saying, “Homines
amplius oculis qua-m auribus credunt.”

184. facundia praesens] An eye-witness
who tells the spectators what he has seen,
and does itin a long speech, as the mes-
senger in the Greek plays. ‘Praesens’
means ‘before the audience.’

186. coquat— Atreus] See C. i. 6.
8n.; and as to Procne, C. iv. 12. 5 n.
Short fragments of the Atreus of Sopho-
cles and Cadmus of Euripides are extant.
The story of Cadmus and his wife Har-
monia changed into serpents is told by
Ovid (Met. iv. 563 sqq.). Such barbari—
ties and miraculous changes, Horace says,
if represented on the stage are both in-
credible and disgusting.

In the tragedy Medea, attributed to
Seneca, the mother strangles her children
on the stage, “notwithstanding the ad-
monition of Horace, who probably had some
similar example of the Roman theatre be—
fore his eyes, for a Greek would hardly have
committed this error. The Roman trage-
dians must have had a particular rage for
novelty and effect to seek them in such
atrocities ’' (Schlegel, Dram. Lit. Lect. xv.).
This author’s estimate of the only Roman
tragedies that remain is very low: they
are “beyond description bombastic and
frigid, unnatural both in character and
action, revolting from their violation of
propriety, and so destitute of theatrical
effect, that they seem never to have been
meant to leave the rhetorical schools for
the stage.''-—· “Every tragical common-

place is worried out to the last gasp ς all
is phrase, and even the most common re-
mark is forced and stiltedss’ διο. This is
exaggerated criticism,but Horace had pro-
bably a low opinion of the tragic writers of
his own day, though he flatters Varius and
Pollio. It is probable, as Schlegel says,
Seneca's plays were never intended to be
acted ; but if so, his remarks above quoted
are not quite consistent. See C. i. 6. 8 n.;
ii. 1. 10 n.; S. i. 10. 42 n.

191. Nec deus intersit] It was a reproach
to the tragedians that ἐπειδάν τι ἀπορῶσιν,
ἐπὶ τὰς μηχανὰς ἀποφεύγουσι θεοὺς αἴροντες
(Plato, Cratyl. i. 425, Steph.), and Aris-
totle (Post. 15) instances the conclusion
of the Medea of Euripides. The gods
were introduced on a platform above, which
is the μηχανή referred to. Hence the
proverb “ Deus ex machina ’³ for any sum-
mary way of winding up a plot, or ex-
tricating oneself from a difficulty. Cicero
uses the same illustration (de Nat. Deor. i.
20): “ut tragici poetae quum explicare
argumenti exitum non potestis, confugitis
ad deum.'’ Forcellini explains ‘vindice’
by “solutore, et quasi liberatore rei adeo
involutae ut ope humana bonus exitus in—
veniri uon possit :’' ‘one brought in to un-
ravel the knot, and deliver the people from
an otherwise hopeless position?

192. nec quarta loqui persona laboret]
Thespis first introduced a single actm· ou
the stage, who perhaps told a story and
served to relieve the chorus. Aeschylus
introduced a second, and so brought regular
dialogue into the drama. Sophocles added
a third, and this number was rarely if ever
exceeded (Epp. i. 18. 14 n.‚ and Mffller,
Lit. Gr. p. 304 sqq). The Romans ob-
ser-ved no such restriction, but if more
