72) that Aesopus, the actor (v. 239 n.)‚ on
one occasion had a dish of singing and
talking birds (“ cantu aliquo aut humano
sermone vocales '’) each of which cost 6000
sestertii, and the whole dish 100‚000, on
which Pliny remarks the man was worthy
of his son who melted the pearl and drank
it. [‘Impenso ' seems to mean ‘a high

money ;’ but that is not certain.]

246. Sanin creta an carbone notandi]
The distinction of days by white and black
marks has been mentioned C. i. 36, 10 n.
Horace here applies them to the distinction
of character, and Persius has imitated him
(S. v. 108): “ Illa prius creta, mox haec
carbone notasti ?'' The MSS. and editions
vary in the reading of this verse. ‘Sani
an’ is the reading of Ven. 1483. ‘ Sani ’

takes it otherwise, and seems to follow the
reading 1 have adopted, saying, “Sanine
sunt ac notandi creta, i.e. bono lapillo quo
sani notandi sunt ; an carbone, i. e. nigro
colore quo malos et perditos designant 3
q. d. sine dubio notandi sunt carbone tan-
quam insani.'' This I believe to be the
true reading and interpretation. ‘ Are they
as men of sound mind to be marked with a
white mark, or (as unsound) with a black ἴθ’
‘ Sanin ’ is due to Bentley, being the fa·
miliar conti-action of ‘saniness Bentley
adopts ⁴ notati ' from several MSS„ instead
of ‘notandi‚’ which the sense requires.
‘ Quorsum abeant θ’ ‘ what is to become of

has ‘ sani . . . notandi θ’]

‘ Children’s

248. Ludere par impar] A child’s gamo,
iu which one person guessed whether tho
number of things another person held in
his hand was odd or even. The Greeks
had the same game, and called it ἁρπάζειν.
Aristoph. Plut. 816. Aristotle, Rhet. iii.
5. 4. Plato, Lys. p. 206. Stertinius goes
on to speak of the man of pleasure, whose
madness is noless than that of the covetoua
the ambitious, or the spendthriflz. With
the last he is closely allied.

250. ratio esse evincet] See above, v. 225.

254. Mutatus Polemon] The story of
Polemon is told by Diog. Laert. iv. c. 16,
and mentioned by many authors. As a
youth he was given to pleasures and bad
company. Passing the Academy with a.
gat-land on his head, and with a band of
riotous companions, while Xenocrates was
lecturing, he burst into the school, but was
so struck with what he heard, thathaving
gone in a thoughtless profligate he came
out serious and quite converted. He suc-
ceeded Xenocrates at the head of the Aca-
demy. Xenocrates himself, whose purity of
life and sobriety of character are referred
to in the word ‘ impransi,' became the head
of the Platonic school on 'the resignation
of Speusippus. He was the disciple of Plato,
and accompanied him on his travels.

255. Fusa-iolas, eubital, focalia] These
are all articles of dress, worn only by women
or men who took great care of their per-
son. ‘ Fasciola’ was a bandage for the legs,
‘ cubital' a sleeve for the arm, ‘ focale’ a
bandage for the throat. See Quintilian (xi.
3. 144), “Palliolum sicut fascias quibus
crura vestiuntur, et* focalia et aurium liga-
menta sola excusare potest valetudo.”
‘ Focale ’ is said to be derived from ⁴ faux!
‘Impransus’ stands for ‘ sobrius? because
it was not usual for abstemious men to take
the mid-day meal (prandium). ‘ Furtim ’
is a happy touch of Horace's. It expresses
the shame of the young man, and his in-
