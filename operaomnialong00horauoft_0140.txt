HORATII FLACCI

Amice Valgi, stat glacies iners ’ 5
Menses per omnes aut Aquilonibus
Querceta Gargani laborant
Et foliis viduantur orni :
Tu semper urges flebilibus modis

Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero

Surgente decedunt amores
Nec rapidum fugiente Solem.
At non ter aevo functus amabilem
Ploravit omnes Antilochum senex

Annos, nec impubem parentes

Flevere semper.

Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten,

- 7. Querceta] ΤῙιθ oldest MSS. have
‘ querqueta.’ The Apulian range Garganus
(Monte Gargano) terminated in the bold
promontory of the same name, now called
Punta di Viaeti. [The ‘ Garganum nemus'
is mentioned again Epp. ii. 1. 202. The
oak forests are no longer there]

13. ter aevo functus] Aulus Gell. (xix.
7) mentions Nestor being called ‘ trisaecli-
senex’ by an obscure poet Laevius. Cic.
(de Senect. c. 10) says, “Nestor tertiam
jam aetatem hominum vivebat.'’ The story
is in Homer (Π. i. 250) 2—-

τῷ δ’ ἤδη δύο μὲν ’γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων
ἐφθίατο-μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν.

The duration of an cannot now be de-
termined. Plutarch (Cat. Maj. c. 15) says
that Cato prosecuted Servius Galba when
he was ninety years of age, κινδυνεύει γὰρ
ὥς Νέστωρ ἐς τριγονίαν τῷ βίῳ καὶ ταῖς
πράξεσι κατελθεῖν. The filia] love and death
of Antilochus are beautifully told by Pindar
(Olym. 18. Pyth. vi. 28 sqq.). Lambinus
fancifully supposes ‘amabilem' may be
equivalent to ἀγαπητόν, an only child.
16.] Thedeath of Troilus, killed by Achil-
les, is related by Virgil (Aen. i. 474), follow-
ing not Homer, but some of the Cyclic
poets, the event having taken place before
the time at which the Iliad opens. (V.
He vne, Exc. in loco.) His sisters were
Crffilnsa, Polyxena, Laodice, and Cassandra.
17. Desine molliwm] A Greek construc-
timu δε ‘abstineto irarum’ (C. iii. 27.
69); ‘Abstinens pecuniae' (iv. 9. 37).
Virgil too (Aen. x. 441) takes the'same

licence, ‘tempus desistere pugnae ς’ ‘dam-
natus laboris’ (C. ii. 14. 19) ; ‘decipitur
laborum' (C. ii. 13. 38) ; ‘ciceris invidit’
(S. ii. 6. 84), are other constructions with
the genitive borrowed from the Greek.

19. Augusti tropaea] See Introduction.

20.] Whether ‘ Niphates' was a moun-
tain or a river has been much discussed.
The Scholiasts Acron and Comm. Cruq.
both say it was a river of Scythia, “ though
(as they add) most say it is a mountain of
Armenia-¹³ Porphyrion so calls it, and
Strabo mentions no other ‘ Niphates’ but
an Armenian range of mountains. The later
poets no doubt speak of a river ‘ Niphates!
For instance, Lucan (Phars. iii. 245) speaks
of “ volventem saxa Niphaten.” Silius
also (xiii. ¹765), “ Pellaeo ponte Niphaten
adstrinxit? Juvenal likewise (vi. 408 sq.)‚

 

·“ Isse Niphaten
In populos magnoque illic cuncta arva
„3231”

Virgil (Georg. iii. 30) says,

“Addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque
Fidefftlessilliie fuga Parthum versisque
Etsaffilitdlsltapta manu diverso ex hoste
Bighssjariumphatas utroque ab littore

gen s.

Here it is uncertain whether Virgil under-
stood Niphates to be a river or a mountain.
The passage is so like Horace’s that he
probably had it in mind3 and it is possible
