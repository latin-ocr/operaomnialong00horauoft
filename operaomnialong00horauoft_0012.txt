viii PREFACE.

though sometimes they are not supported by any that are known
now.

The editions that Ι have consulted Ι will not tire the reader by
enumerating. No classical author has been edited and commented
upon so often as Horace. The editions Ι have always referred to
when a difficulty of , interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius
(1519), with the scholia of Acron and Porphyrion, Lambinus,
Cruquius (for his commentator), Torrentius, Gesner, Doering, Dil-
lenburger, and Orelli. From these Ι have got real help, especially
from Torrentius, whose commentary is in general clear, learned, and
judicious. I have often referred to the French editors Sanadon and
Dacier, but their judgment is not to be trusted. The old edition of
Landini, published at Florence in 1482, and reprinted at Venice the
next year, is in my possession, and will be found frequently referred
to for various readings as “ Ven. 1483,” or simply “ Ven.” Fea has
a good many sensible notes, but I have found him most useful for
inscriptions, of which he gives several. J ani and Mitscherlich have
edited the Odes, but are so redundant in quotation and admiring
exclamation, that their commentaries are disagreeable. The Satires
are much indebted to the learning and dilig-enee of Heindorf, whose
copious notes and judicious prefaces must be of use to any one who
consults them, though his text Ι do not think is always well chosen.
His notes on law-terms are valuable, but in such matters I have
been chiefly indebted to the judgment of my friend and coadjutor
Mr. Long, whose advice I have likewise followed in many other
particulars.

I have not entered at any length upon the chronolog-y of Horace’s
poems, I have referred to the subject in the Introduction, and
have done my best to determine the date of each poem so far as
there are reasonable grounds to argue upon. The principal autho·
rities on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
are Franke (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirchner (Quaes-
tiones Horatianae, Leipzig, 1834). These two writers differ mate-
rially from one another, and both of them from Bentley, who in his
