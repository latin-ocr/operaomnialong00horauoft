For ‘quid tam magnum' (with which com-

‘Illo die’ Porphyrion explains to mean
‘die Jovise The Jews fasted on Thurs·
days 81111 Mondays (⁶⁸1 fast twice in the
week,” Lnke xviii. 12) in commemoration‚
it is said, of Moses’ ascent into the Mount
on the fisth day of the week, and of his
return on the second. The practices of the
Jews were the best illustrations of super·
stition in the eyoe of Horace and men of
the world, and their fast is here perhaps
‘enuded to. See note on S.i. 9.69. On special
occasions fasts were ordered like that which
was instituted in honour of Ceres, Anu-c.
561, when the decemvirs, aster consulting
the Sibylline books, reported “Jejunium
instituendum Cereri esse et id quinto quo-
que anno servandum ” (Livy, xxxvi. 37).
The vow made by the mother for her sick
child is intended to represe
foreign superstition, as the Romans held
it, that of bathing the body in 1011811 of the
purifying of the soul. Juvenal (vi. 522,
sqq.) represents a woman under the in·
fluence of priests dipping herself three
times in the 'l'iber on a cold winter-’s morn-
ingwhen she had to break the ice to get
in; and Persius (ii. 15) says of the hypo-
crite who prayed to the gods to send him
a tre-asum, or to put his ward or his wife

out of the way :—
“ Haec sancte nt poscam, Tiberino in gurgite
