“ Nonne vides Albi ut male vivat filius, utque

tolinus round it. Such a coin is repre-

sented in the notice of this person in
Smith’s Dict. Biog. The story of the
crown is very likely to have been invented.
That he was tried on some serious charge
and acquitted, and that the verdict did not
escape scandal, is clear from the context.
See also S. 10. 26. The nature of the
accusation, notwithstanding the precise
story of the Scholiasts, must remain a
matter of doubt. We may also gather that
he was a person of influence from v. 97,
which he must have been if he was ac·
quitted, or supposed to have been ac·

quitted, through the corruption of the
jury. There is sarcasm in ‘sed tamen
admiror? dcc„ which Horace calls‘ succus
loliginis, 'the dark secretion of the cuttle-
fish, gblack and malignant. (Pliny, H. N. xx.
c. 29, quoted by Ritter.) ‘Aerugo mera‚'

nothing but copper- -rust that eats into
character and destroys it. Compare Mar-
tial (x. 33) :—

“ Ut tu, si viridi tinctos aerugine versus
Forte malus livor dixerit esse meos,
Ut facis, a nobis abigas.'’

102. ut si quid] Tbere is a little ob-
scurity in the construction, but the sense
is plain. ‘I promise truly, as I can, if Ι
can promise of myself aught else with
truth? ‘Promitto vere, ut possum si quid
aliud de me promittere possum?

104. hoc mihi juris] ‘So much liberty
as this? [So the Romans said ‘id aetatis‚'
¹ id temporis.']

105. insuevit pater optimus hoc me]
‘ Suesco: aud its compounds have an ac-

tive as well as a neuter signification, taking
usually an accusative of the person and
dative of the thing, which order ιε inverted
in Virg. (Aen. vi. 833),‘ ‘Ne‚ pueri, ne
tanta animis assuescite bella.'’ pS. ii. 2.
109 we have “Pluribus assuerit mentem
corpusque superbum.'' [Here there is a
double accusative aster ‘ insuevitst] Lam-
binus altcrs the received reading into ‘ in·
sevit pater optimus hoc mi‚' and for ⁶ inse-
vit' there is some MS. authority. But it
is not likely to be the right word here. If
‘me ’ is retained, the construction is that
of the Greeks, who said ’ἐθίζειν τινά τι.
Bentley is clearly wrong in rendering ‘hoc’
with ‘fugerem.' The position is against
that construction, and moreover it gives
no sense. Orelli applies ‘notando' to
Horace himself. ‘ My excellent father
accustomed me to this, that Ι should avoid,
by means of examples, each particular vice
by noting it (as it came before me) ς’ but
‘notando’ seems to have more of the
technical sense, and applies to the father,
who taught his son to avoid vices, by
branding them in each instance by means
ofexamples. See S. i. 6. 14n.‚ on ‘no-
108. quod mi ipse parasset] Horace’s
father had lived a life of fru'gnl industry,
and' m addition to any ‘peculium' he may
have laid by as a‘ servus, ’118 made enough
money by his occupatiori of ‘’coactor (S.
6. 86) to pnrchase a farm of no great
value at Venusia, to pay for his son’s
education at Rome, and afterwards at
Athens.
