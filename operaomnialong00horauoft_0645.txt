Fauo-rmus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si recte frueris, non est ut copia major

Ab Jove donari possit tibi.

Tolle querelas;

Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus.

Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil 5
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

Si forte ιιι medio positorum abstemius herbis

Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus ut te

Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret ;

Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,

Vel quia. cuncta putas una. virtute minora.

Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

l. fluetibus Agrippae] From what
source· Agrippa derived his immense weixlth
wodo not know. From this Epistle we

’ leam that he had estates in Sicily, proba-

bly given him aster his success against Sex.
Pompeius. Iccius, says Horace, bas a good
post and may be very comfortable if heis
careful. He' is generally called the‘ procura-
tor’ ongrippa, and that word may express
his office, since ‘procurator' was one who
acted for mother with his anthority.1:[e
might be mlled ‘’ccacmr as collector of
ruta, hut probably his snpervisiou was
But he must not be supposed to
> lave been Agrippa’ s ‘villicum’ 'she‘ vil-

’ - licus' wasaslave (Ep. 14. 1).

4. cna mum suppetit ms] ‘Rerum
um'here seems to mean the supply of
thingsneedful. ‘peSup tere' ‘tobe suffi-
nieuw eccui-sin Epod. xvii. 64. ‘'Pauper
is here used more inthe sense ofpriva-
tion thau Horace geyuerall uses it.

5. sivestri bene, εἰ lateri] Thisseems
to be a translation of Solon’ s versos, quoted
by Plutarch (Sol. c. 2), who says of him
πλοῦτον δ’ υῦκ ἐθαύμαζεν, ἀλλὰ καί φησιν
ὁμοίως πλουτεῖν ῳ τε-

*ambs ἄργυρός ἐστι
καὶ χρυσὸς καὶ γῆς πυροφόρου πεδία,

ἵπποι θ’ ἡμίονοί τε, καὶ ὅ μόνα ταῦτα
γαστρί ΖΓ καὶ πλευρῇ καὶ ποσὶν ἁβρὰ

παθεῖν.

[‘Siventribene:’ seeEp p.p i.1. 89.]

7. poenorum] ‘’Ponere is the usual
word {br utting dishes on the table (S. ii.
2. 23). ere fine dishes are meant, as we
can tell by the context. Thenettle ‘urtica’

forms an ingr-edient in the broth of poor
peop lein this country, and still more in
Scotland. ‘Protinus' means ‘right ou‚'
and is applied' ιιι various ways. Here it
means ‘in an nninterrupted com-se, 'that
is, ‘alway s.' ‘’Ut means ‘even suppos-
i,’ng as in Epod. i. 21. ‘Confestim'
ἐτηίςΙιτνσιις, 'has the same root as [‘ in-
festu& ‘confertus ’.] Though‘ Fortunae
rivus’ occurs nowhere else in extant writ-
ers, it seems, as Orelli says, to have been a
proverbial expression.

10. naturam mutare] Horace says the
same in a different application elsewhere

(Epod.' ιν. 5) :—
“ Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genns.'’

12. Miramur si Democriti] 1 do not
agree with Orelli in his interpretation of
this passage. (See Argument.) The father
of Democritus entertained Xerxes at Ab·
dei-a, from which we iuay infer that he had
property (Diog. Laert- ix. Democritus).
'rhe son travelled a great part of his life
and squandered his means in this way.
OEcero says he was reported to have put
out his eyae to prevent his mind froin being
disti-acted, and that he neglected his patri-
mony and lest his lands nncultivated. (De
Finn. v. 29; Tusc. Disp. v. 39.) Ιιι what
eve'r wa) he⁸ wasted his good5, it seems his
name had passed into a proverb.

14. oum tu inter scabiem] There' is no
reflection on locius in these words. His
occupation as a collector of rents and over-
seer of a la rge estate would bring a good
deal of dirty work upon his hands, and tho
words are well suited to express the con-
