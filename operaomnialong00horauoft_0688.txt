HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLARUM Ι. 20.

Me, libertino natum patre et in tenui re, 20
Majores pennas nidoextendisse loqueris,

Ut quantum generi demas virtutibusfaddas ς

Me primis Urbis belli placuisse domique;

Corporis exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum,

Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis-essem. 25
Forte meum si quis te percontabitur aevum,

Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres

Collegam Lepidum quo duxit Lollius anno.

people read to themselves or one another.
See Martial (iv. 8. 7), “ Hora libellorum
decima est, Eupheme, meorum.” It is not
easy to see the connexion of this line with
what goes before. It is something of a
contradiction. With ‘Me libertino natum
patre,' compare S. i. 6. 6, 46, 47. [There
is no connexion between this line and those
which precede it. He supposes that his
book will be read to listeners, who are re-
presented by ‘aures' The explanation of
‘ tepidus sol' is not so easy. It may refer
to the cooler part of the day, morning or
evgglnguf'e primis Urbis] This he consi-
ders no small praise, as he says Epp. i. 17.
35, “ Principibus placuisse viris 11011 ultima
laus est;’' and S. ii. 1. 75, “tamen me
Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque
Invidia.'’ He does not scruple at this
time to refer to his old generals, Brutus
and Cassius. The description he gives of
himself corresponds with that in his bio-
grapher. Sec also Epp. i. 4. 15. C. ii.
11. 15. ‘ Solibus aptum' means that he
likcd warm weather. See ii. 3. 10 11.
[‘Belli,' ‘ domi: are cases of locality.

Ritter connects ‘belli domique’ with
‘ principibus,’ in order to avoid an allusion
to Horace's service under Brutus and
Cassius]

28. Colleyam- Lepidum] Horace was
born on the Sth December ΔΑΜ). 689, iu
the consulship of L. Manlius Torquatus
and L. Aurelius Cotta. He completed his
44th year therefore in December A.U.c.
¹733. In that year M. Lollius (to whom
C. iv. 9 is addressed) was elected consul,
and the other consulship was offered to
Augustus, who was iu Sicily, on his way
to Samos for his health. Augustus re-
fused it, and after a great deal of inti-igue
and disturbance between Q. Aemilius Le·
pidus and L. Silanus, who were summoned
by Augustus to answer to him for their
conduct, Lepidus was elected. Orelli
thinks this aster-election is referred to in
the word ‘ duxit: as if Lollius, being first
in the place, drew the other to him, which
appears to me rather far-fewhed. [But
it is not easy to find another explanation,
unless we accept Kriiger’s suggestion that
Horace uses ‘duxit’ ina jocular way, as in
the phrase ‘ uxorem ducerefl]
