GARMEN VIII.

'rho principle of identification baa led to strange confusion md inventione reapecting
,thememmedinthisoda IiindfromEshethatone acholarhaaaffirmed, thatby
Lydi- Horace meant Iulia, and by Sybaris Marcellus. The reader- has only ω compare
the odaa' m whichthis name occurs, and he will form his own opinion. Here there* ιι no
tigu of jealousy, but anxiety for the reputation of Sybarin in C. i. 13 there‘ ιι violent
jealousy of Telephum in iii. 9 themis a lover’s coqnetting and reconciliation; while in
i. 25 Lydia' ιι a worn-out prostitutc looking for lovers who will not come. Ifwe had
more of Anacreon' ι poetry to guide ιιι, we should probably aee such traces of the origin
cf an these odea aa would put the matter in the right light. The name of Sybarin is
obviously intended to repre-ent the elur-ator into which the youth has fallen.

ARGUMENT.

Lydia, why art thou spoiling Sybaris thus, ιο that be ahuna all manly exerciaea ἲ He
who was once ao active, why does he ιιο longer ride, and swim, and wrestle, and

thmw the quoit and javelin in the Campus Martius Ρ Why does he hide himself with
thee, like Achillea, in woman’s apparel Ρ

LYmA, dic, per omnes

Te deos oro, Sybarin cur properas amando
Perdere 3 cur apricum

Oderit eampum patiens pulveris atque solis ⁴?
Gur neque militaris 5

Inter aequales equitat, Gallica nee lupatis
Temperat ora frenis ⁴?

Cur timet flavum Tiberim tangere Ρ Cur olivum
Sanguine viperino

Cautius vitat, neque jam livida gaetat armis ιο
Brachia saepe disco,

Saepe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito ⁴?
Quid latet, ut marinae

Filium dieunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Trojae
Funera ne virilis 15

Cultus in caedem et Lycias proriperet catervas Ρ
