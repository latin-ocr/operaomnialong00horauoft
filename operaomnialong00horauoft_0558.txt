522 HORATII FLACCI

Pocula seu modicis uvescit laetius.

Ergo 70

Sermo oritur, non de villis domibusve alienis,

-Nec male necne Lepos saltet ,- sed quod magis ad nos

Pertinet et nescire malum est agitamus : utrumne

Divitiis homines an sint virtute beati3

Quidve ad amicitias, usus rectumne, trahat n0s3 75
Et quae sit natura boni summumque quid ejus.

Cervius haec inter vicinus garrit aniles

Ex re fabellas.

Si quis nam laudat Arelli

Sollicitas ignarus opes, sic incipit: “ Olim

Rusticus urbanum murem mus paupere fertur 80
Accepisse cavo, veterem vetus hospes amicum,

Asper et attentus quaesitis, ut tamen artum

Cicero, describing Verres' riotous living,
says, “ iste enim praetor severus ac diligens
qui populi Romani legibus nunquam paru-
isset, illis legibus quae in poculis poneban-
tur diligenter obtemperabat” (Act. ii. 5.
11). One of the strictest laws of a ban-
quet directed by a presiding symposiarch
would have reference to the regulation of
the quantity of wine to be drunk by each
guest at each round. Horace's notion of
liberty is to drink as much or as little as he
pleased‚ which is expressed by ‘inaequales
calices? [‘ Acria pocula ;’ ‘ acria ' seems
to mean ‘ strong‚' and ‘ modicis’ will be
the opposite]

70. uvescit] Lambinus introduced this
reading from some of his MSS„ which were
confirmed by cruquius‚ and since by many
more. The old reading was ‘ humescit.'
‘ Uvescere ' corresponds with Horace's
word ‘uvidus,’ C. ii. 19. 18, “ Tu separatis
uvidus in jugis ;” and iv. 5. 38, “ Dicimus
integro Sicci mane (lie, dicimus uvidi Cum
sol Oceano subest.”

72. Nec male necne Lepos saltet] Lepos
was a ‘ mimus ' who was so named accord-
ing to the Scholiasts‚ and as the name
itself imports, “quod jucunde et molliter
saltaret et eloqueretur.'’ The business of
the ‘ mimi‚’ as ofthe ‘ mimae' (S. i. 2. 2 11.),
was to recite poetry as well as to act parts
in the fui-ces that bore the same name (S.
i. 10. 6 n.). The word ‘ saltare ' was ap-
plied to all the pantomiinic acting and the
motion of the limbs iu dumb show. See
S. i. 5. 63, where Messius calls upon Sar-
mentus to act Polyphemus—“ Pastorem
saltaret uti Cyclopa rognbat‚’' where ‘ sal-

. taret ' is equivalent to ‘ movetur' in “Nunc

Satyrum nunc pastorem Cyclopa movetur’'
(Epp. ii. 2. 125).

[73. utrumne—an] Comp. Epod. i. 7.]
75. usus rectumne] Cicero makes Laelius
indignantly deny the doctrine that makes
utility the foundation of friendship, and he
says with much truth and delicacy, “ non
enim tam utilitas parta per amicum quam
amici amor ipse delectat” (Lael. e. 14).
There is more in the same strain in c. 8,
where he makes virtue the basis of friend-
ship. Ovid (ex Pont. ii. 3. 7) says mom-n-

fully enough :—

“ Turpe quidem dictu sed (si modo vera
fatemur)
Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat.''

The other subject, ‘ natura boni summum-
que‚' is discussed at large in Cicero's trea-
tise ‘de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum: and
was a common—place in Horace’s day, as it
has been in all τις-ω. ‘Summum' repre-
sents the Greek τέλος, ‘ the end proposed‚’
so frequent in Aristotle and the philoso-
hers.

p 77. Cervius] This was an old neighbour
of Horace, and that is allwe know. Arel-
lius was some rich man, eareful about his
mone .

78.ySi quis naum] Nearly all the old
editions have ‘ nam si quis,’ but the Mss.
are mostly in favour of ‘ si quis nam?
which Bentley restored to the text, and
most of the modern editors have it so. The
‘nam ' is awkwardly placed.

79. Olim] ‘Once upon a time :¹ a com-
mon way of beginning a story that does
not profess to be true.

82. attentus] This is a common word
for what we should call ‘close’ See Epp. i.
7. 913 ii. 1. 172. [‘Attentus ut’ is like
‘mirus ut‚’ Epod. xvi. 31 n.; but the
meaning of ‘attentus’ requires a qualifi-
