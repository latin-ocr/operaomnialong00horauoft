438 HORATII FLACCI

unreasonably‚ that it followed at no great distance of time the eighth of the first book,
from which Trebatius quotes and not from any in the second book, from which he
might as easily and more naturally have quoted if they had been written at the time 3
for that they were published as soon as written, and not for the first time when they
were collected in books, is sufficiently evident.

ARGUMENT.

Some men think my satire too severe, others think it wants power. Tell me, Trebatius,
what am 1 to do Ρ

Keep quiet.

What, not write at all Ρ

That is my advice. ,

Well certainly it would be better 3 but 1 can get no rest.

Then go and swim the Tiber, or drink freely over-night ς or, if you must write, write of
Caesar's renown, and you will get your reward.

Good father, I have no strength for that z the battle-field is not a fit theme I'or every
oue.

But you may write of his virtues and his fortitude, as Lucilius wrote of Scipio’s.

So I will when opportunity offers. But Caesar is only to be approached at the proper
time. Stroke him clumsily and like a spirited horse he kicks.

But how much better is this than to libel buffoons and prodigals, and so make an enemy
of every body.

What am Ι to do Ρ Every man has his taste, and mine is to string words together, as

. Lucilius did. He trusted all his secret thoughts to his books: inprosperity or adver·

sity he made them his friends 3 so that there you see the man's life drawn out as in
a picture. Him the humble poet of Venusia follows. But Ι attaek no one without
provocation: why should Ι Ρ Ι desire peace, but woe to the man that rouses me.
He'll suffer for it, and find himself the talk of the town. And this is in the course
of nature. Every animal defends itself with its own proper weapons. The long and

’ short of it is, I must write whether I am to die presently or in a quiet old age, rich or
poor, at home or an exile, whatever or wherever 1 may be.

Young man, Ι fear your life is not worth much: your great friends will freeze you to —

WlliisstssereLaelius and Scipio offended with Lucilius when he attacked all the great

men of his day, sparing none but the virtuous Ρ Nay, they loved him and lived with
him most familiarly. I may be much beneath Lucilius in wealth and genius ς but Ι
too have illustrious friends, and if any one thinks to put his teeth into me he will
find himself mistaken. Do you object to that, Trebatius P

No, I do not. But I must remind you that if any man write scurrilous verses against
another, the law allows him a remedy.

I grant you, scurrilous: but what if they are good and proper verses, and the person
worthy to be exposed Ρ ·

Why then the court will laugh at the joke, and you will come off scot free.
