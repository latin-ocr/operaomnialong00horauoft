188 HORATII FLACCI

Telephus, But it looks rather ill that this well-bred learned Greek, who lived on‘such‘
intimate terms with Horace, is never heard of in any other place. The best information
about him may be gleaned from the other two odeS. Telephus is a poetical name which
Horace uses when it suits his purpose, as here, for instance, when he wanted such an one
to give an air of individuality to an ode beginning with the humorous reproof, ‘Yon tell
us a great deal about the race of Codrus and of Aeacus, and about the Trojan War, but
as to how, where, and on what we are to dine to-day, you don’t say a word.”’ This is
Buttmann's opinion, and I think any sensible man who reflects on the subject, without
preconceptions of reality in his mind, will agree with him. At any rate a very slight
groundwork of truth would be enough for the part that Telephus bears in this ode, and
on such quaetions conjecture and time are thrown away. [Ritter tells us to take his
word, and believe that Telephus is the rhetorician Heliodorus, S. i. 5. 2. The reason
for Horace giving him this name is as wonderful as the discovery itself. Yet Ritter
says that the Telephus of C. iv. 11 is a different person.] Of ¹the date we can only say
it was written before A.U.c. 732, for the reasons stated C. ii. 10. The season was
winter (v. 8), and the day was the first of the mouth (probably of the year).

Dillenbr. supposes the ode to have arisen out of the following scene. On a oold
dull winter evening Horace is sitting in a room with some friends. They are talking
and drinking without much spirit, till at last the dulness of the conversation turning
upon dry points of history, through the prosy pedantry of some one of the party, Horace

⁴can bear it no longer, and bursts out with the contemptuous language with which the

ode begins3 then calls his friends to drink, and sets them the example. It is easy to

adapt such a scene to the ode; but there can be little doubt, 1 think, that it is one on

which Horace bestowed more than average pains, though there is no ode in which the'
“ ars celare artem '’ is more conspicuous. It is impossible to suppose it the work of a

moment, as Dillenbr.'s very neat adaptation would require us to suppose. He thinks '
the ode is one of the early ones, as more akin to the fire of youth than the sobriety of

later life, to which remark Ι attach no importance.

ARGUMENT.

Talk not of Codrus, and Inachus, and Trojan wars: tell us what we may get a cask of
Chian sor, who will give us bath and house-mom, and at what hour we may dine to-
day. A cup, boy‚ to the new moon, another to midnight, and a third to Murena the
augur3 three and nine or nine and three; the rapt poet loves the nine; pure the
Graces forbid. Let us be mad: bring music, scatterproses, let old neighbour Lycus
and his young ill-sorted partner hear our noise and envy us. Rhode runs after thee,
Telephus, with thy beautiful hair and bright face: as for me, I am wasting with
love of Glycera.
