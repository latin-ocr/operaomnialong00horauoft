21. Mira] A complete and very eom-
prehensive sentence. It occurs below (C.

213. 6). Some persons join the word on

with the last line, which weakens its force.
[‘ Icari :¹ the small rocky island Icarus or

round in a small circle (ovid. Her. iv.

¹79).

Tacitus (Germ. vi.) says the German horses
were not taught like the Roman ‘variare

else. See C. i. 8. 35 iii. 12. 7.

29. neque in vias] This use of ‘ neque’
for ‘neve‚’ in connexion with the impera-

grammius· It is confined to the poets.

[30. cantu] There is a reading cantu,
that is, ‘cantum,’ which may be right, for
the meaning perhaps is ‘when the music
begins,’ S. i. 1. 10. ‘Sub cantu’ means
‘during the music.']
