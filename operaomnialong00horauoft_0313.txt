See Juvenal (Sat. iv. 140 aud note). [‘Ap-
paret :' see C. i. 37. 1.]

51. intonata] This participle occurs no-
where else in extant writers ς but it is not
likely Horace invented it. It represents
the noise of the wind rather thau of the
clouds, as virgil (Georg. i. 371) says,
“ Eurique Zephyrique tonat domus.''
Duentzer renders it as a passive participle,
‘ sent thundering ;’ but it is more likely an
old deponent form. The ‘scarus,' what-

‘ever that fish may be, is said by Pliny to

have abounded most in the Carpathian sea.
The storin therefore must come from the
east that should drive it to the coast of
Italy. What bird is meant by ‘ Afra avis’
we cannot tell, nor does Varro help us by
saying that the Greeks called Gallinae
Africanae by the name μελεαγρίδες, a bird
also unknown. Columella (viii. 2) distin-
guishes them, saying the Africana had a
red erest, the Greek a blue. The African
pheasant is a bird of remarkably beautiful
plumage and very rane, but Ι believe that
it is only found at present on the southern
coast of Africa: and, whatever bird the
Roman writers refer to, it was less re-
marked for its beauty than its delicacy.
Martial (iii. 58. 15) speaks of “ Numidicae
guttatae ’' ‘speckled,' which seems to be
the same bird, and answers to the appear-
ance of the guiuea-fowL which fowl also
corresponds to Varro’s description, “ Gal-
linae Africanae sunt grandes, variae, gib.
berae '' (De R. R. iii. 9. 18). Juvenal
mentions it as a delieacy (Sat. xi. 142

sq.) :—
“ Negffzmtum capreae subducere, nec latus
