Fea sepsi-ates ‘’molestus from the p-reced
ing words, and reads “ Molestus! Com-
muni sensu plane caret, mquimus.” [Ritoer
and Kriigei·p have it thus: ‘molestus Com
muni. . caret‚’ which means the same as
Fea's text] ⁴ Common sense‚’ for which the
Greeks had the expression ὁ κοινὸς νοῦς, is
so called, not as being exercised upon com·
mon every-day things, bnt as being sup-
to be common property, and not
conflued to the learned. [J uvenal, S. viii.

67. leyen· sancimus]
is properly to give effect to a law by adding
a penalty for the breach of it. See Cic. de
Am. e. 13 : “Haec igitur prima lex amici-
tiae sanciatur. ’'

70. Cum mea compenset vitiis bona]
There· is a strife here among the commen·
tators. The Scholiasts interpret‘ cum' as
a preposition. Some editors take it as a
conjunction. Bentley, Heindorf, Orelli,
and Dillenbr. follow the Scholiasts‚ 1 think
with good reason. Fea, Meineke [Rima]
Duentzer are on the other side. 'rhe last
says with much confidence that Horace
would have pnt the substantive next to

‘cum 'if he had meant it for a preposition.
But Horace perhaps preferred bringing
together the words that are opposed to one
another, ‘vitiis' and‘ bona? There ιε no

‘ Saneire legem '

more abruptness arising out of the absence
of a conjunction between‘ bona' and‘ plu-

ribus ’ than the character of the discourse
renders natural. Heindorf takes ‘hac
lege' with‘ amari si volet? 1 do not see
any objection to that punctuation; but the
common way is at least as good. ‘-Com

pensare' is a legal term. ‘Compensatio’

is a ‘.'set·off [⁸ Let him set off my good
qualities against the bad. ’]
