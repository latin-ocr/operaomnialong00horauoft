Plotius Tucca, to whom a Scholium edited

gives the praenomen Marcus, appears from
the nme authority to have been a native
of Cisalpine Gaul. He was associated with
L. Varius Rufus by virgil, who loved them
both, in the task of editing the Aeneid
aster his death. Nothing more is known
of him, but what we gather from this pas·
ange and S. i. 10. 81, that he was one of
Maecenas' friends, and on intimate terma
with Horace. L. Varius, whose cognomen

guiahed poet in hia day. As au epic poet
Horace places him among thelint (C. i. 6.
1; S. i. 10.·13). To him astervirgil he
owed his introduction to Maecenas (S. i. 6.
55), in whose company we find him at the
house of Nasidienus (S. ii. 8. 21). That
he was very popular with his contempora·
ries, and much admired by them, may be

of him particulary from the ninety -third
verse of this Satire· . “Flentibus hic Va-
rius discedit maestus amicis.'’ He is sup·
puaed by Weichert to have been much older
thanVirgilandHorace, andtobethe
friend alluded to by Catullus in his poem
(C. x.), which in the common texts begins
“ Varus me meus ad suos ωσι-αἶ’ Au-
gustus also had an affection for him, aa we
know from Epp. ii. 1. 245 z

“ At neque dedecorant tua de se judicia

on which pamage Comm. Cruq. informs us
that Augustus had made a present to each
of these poets of a million sesterces. Thia
is confirmed by the Parisino codex referred
to in his life in the Diet. Myth„ which
says Varius received this sum for his
Thy oetoe. (SeeC. i. 6. 8n.) Varius and
virgil are osten mentioned together by
Horace, and Martial puts them all toge-
ther (xii. 4, to Terentipus Priscus).

“Quod Flacco fuit et Vario summoque
