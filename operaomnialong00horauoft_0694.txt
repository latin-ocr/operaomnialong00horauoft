HORATII FLACCI

J urendasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras,
Nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes,
Sed tuus hic populus, sapiens et justus in uno,
Te nostris ducibus, te Graiis anteferendo,

Cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque

Aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota. suisque
Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit 3¹.
Sic fautor veterum >ut tabulas peccare vetantes
Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

tions a temple of great beauty built in
honour of Rome and Augustus by Herod
the Great at Caesarea, with a colossal sta—
tue of Augustus as large as that of the
Olympian Zeus after which it was mo-
delled; and another of Rome like that of
Here at Argos. This was built of course
during his life 3 but Suetonius' testimony
that he refused a temple at Rome is con·
firmed in part by Tiberius (Ann. iv. 38):
“Optimos quippe mortalium altissima
cupere. Sic Herculem et Liberum apud
Graecos, Quirinum apud nos deum numero
additos. Melius Augustum qui speraverit?

During his life he desired to be accounted
the son of Apollo, and was represented on

¹ coins in the character of that god playing

on a harp 3 and Acron (on Epp. 1. 3. 17)
says he set up a statue of himself in the
library on the Palatine in the dress and
likeness of Apollo. There is also a 00111 111
Patini's collection representing him with
Jove’s ‘fulmen.' But it may be assumed
that 110 was not worshipped in the city till
he was dead (when several temples were
erected to him, and his worship was regu-
larly established), and that the altars Ho-
race speaks of were those which were raised
in the provinces.

16. Jwrandasque tuwm per nomen] The
oldest Blandinian MS. and a few others
have ‘ numen‚' which Bentley defends.
[Ritter has ‘numen.'] ‘Nomen' is the
reading of all editions before his. He
would also alter the text in Tac. (Ann. i.
73), where it is said “ Rubrio crimini da-
batur violatum perjurio nomen Augusti.”
He also quotes an altar inscription (Gruter,
p. 229) ι “ Numini Augusti votum suscep-
tum a plebe Narbonensium in perpetuum,'’
the date of which was A.U.c. 764, while
Augustus was alive. Horace uses ‘numen’
in C. iv. 5. 35: “et Laribus tuum Misce-
bit numen ;” and Ovid constantly uses it
in the way of flattery. Horace might have
written ‘numen ’ here, but I do not see
why he should not have said ‘nomen,’ or

why nearly all the copyists should have
substituted the latter less likely word for
the other, both in this place and that of
Tacitus above. The person who swore by
the altar laid his hand upon it and invoked
the name of the divinity to whom it was
consecrated. The act is represented on a
gem in Gorlaeus' collection, part ii. 63.

17. Nil oriturum alias] Ο. iv. 2. 37 z—

“ Quo nihil majus meliusve terris
Fata donavere bonique divi
Nec dabunt.''

20. simili ratione modoque] This' is the
third time Horace uses this combination-
See S. ii. 3. 266, 271. [‘ Temporibus de-

functa? ‘quae sua tempora compleverint
ac finierint,’ Porphyrion. ]

23. Sic fautor veterum] Suetonius,
commending the simplicity of Augustus’
style of language (c. 86), adds. “-Cacoze
los et antiquarios, ut diverso genere vitio-
sos, pari fastidio sprevit.’' Κακόζηλον
signifies affectation of any kind (Quint.
Inst. viii. 3). He would therefore‚asOrelli

says, be pleased with these remarks of¹

Horace.
24. Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt]
In Α.1Ἱ.ο.303, ten patricians were appointed
for one year to draw up 0 00ᾱο of laws, of
which the greater part was finished‘ 111 that
year, and engraved upon ten tables. In
the following year the decemvir-ate was re—
newed, with the difference that three ple-
bians were elected among them, and two
more tables were added. These tables con-
tained the fundamental principles of Ro-
man law. Cicero s with more respect
than Horace does of the age in which
they were written (de Re Pub. iv. 8).
“Α(11111101· 1100 rerum solum, sed verborum
etiam elegantiam? In his time, as ob·
served before (S.' 1. 6. 77 11.), they were
committed to memory by boys at sch0013
but before his death the practice had oeased,
probably because of the archaic forms 0111·-
ployed. He says:
