HORA'PII FLACCI ·

ARGUMENT.

Whoever planted thee, thou trec, did so on an evil ‹lay; and with impious hand 118 rem-ed
thee to 1118 destruction of his children and the (lisgrace of the village. Parricide,
guest-murder,-there is no crime 118 would not commit. No one is safe against
danger. The Phoenician sailor fears the Bosporus, and nothing else3 our soldier
the Parthian ; the Parthian nothing but the might of Rome 3 but death comes sud-
denly on all. How nearly was 1 sent to the regions below, where all the shades
wonder, Cerberus listens, the Furies are chax-med, and the damned suspend their

labours, while Sappho complains of her faithless countrywomen, and Alcaeus sings
of the dangers of the deep and of the battle-field.

ILLE et nefasto te posuit die,
Quicunque primum, et sacrilega manu
Produxit, arbos, in nepotum
Perniciem opprobriumque pagi 3

Illum et parentis crediderim sui

Fregisse cervicem et penetralia
Sparsisse nocturno cruore
Hospitis 3 ille venena Colchica
Et quidquid usquam concipitur nefas

In domini caput immerentis.

1. nefasto] A ‘ dies nefastus ’ was pro-
perly one on which, the day being dedicated
to religion, it was not lawful for the praetor

to hold his court. Ovid thus deflues ‘dies

fasti* and ‘nefasti’ (Fast. i. 47) :—

“Ille nefastus erit per quem tria verba

silentur ;

Fastus erit per quem lege licebit agi;''
where the three words alluded to are said
to be ‘do,’ ‘dico,’ ‘ addieo‚' all of them
familiar in Roman civil procedure. Hence
the name, which is compoundcd of ‘ne’ and
the root of ' ‘faril And, because no secu-
lar work but what was necessary could
prosper on the days called ‘nefasti,' all un-
lucky days came to bear that name as here;
and the word was thence applied to express
all that was bad, as Q· 1. 35. 35. Bentley
and others have attempted to mend the
text‘ lu ν81·1(1118 ways, (11·- which Bentley' s is
the worst. The sense is. “He 11(11 only
planted thee on an evil day (whoever it was
that first planted thee), 11111 with impious
hand reared thee.” 'The pagus was Man-
dela in a valley of the Sabine 111118, where
Horace had his farm.

6. Regiae cervicem] This 18 the ordi-
naryp phrase for strangulation. 13de ιίἰ.

2. Sallust (Cat 55) has ‘laqueo galam.

fregere ι’ and Cicero (in Verrem, ii. 5. 42):
“ Praetorem tu accusas Ρ Frange eervices?
The force of ‘penetralia’ is, that in the
inner part of the house the images of the
penates and the heurth of Vesta were
p‚laced where, if any where, the person of

‘.I would assert my belief, if there were
occasion to do so.’]

[7. nocturno cruere hospitis] A form
of expression both Latin and Greek. caesar,
B. G. i. 36: ‘fraternum nomen populi
Romani ;' ‘domestica exempla virtutis,’
Cic. Phil. xiv. 13 : πατρῷον ἄστυ γῆς, Soph-
Oed. Col. 297 .]

8. venena Colchica] Some MSS. and
most of the old editions have Colchica, and

for the metre' s sake Ι adop t it. Orelli and >

nearly all modern editions (Ritter and Kel-
ler also) have Colcha, an ordinary poetice]
form. Qf- the same abbreviated form are
Marsus, Maurus, Medus, Hispanus, διο.

11. caducum] This word signifies ‘fall-
in g’ (C. iii. 4. 44), ‘‚fallen’ or ‘readyto
falgl? More generally the 1881, 88 here.
virgil has (Aen. vi. 481)· “Hic multum
