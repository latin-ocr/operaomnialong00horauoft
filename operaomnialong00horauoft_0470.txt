HORATII FLACCI

Non ego3 nam satis est equitem mihi plaudere, ut audax
Contemptis aliis explosa Arbuscula dixit.

Men moveat cimex Pantilius, aut cruciet quod

Vellicet absentem Demetrius, aut quod ineptus

Fannius Hermogenis laedat conviva Tigelli ⁸?

Plotius et Varius, Maecenas Virgiliusque,
Valgius et probet haec Octavius, optimus atque
Fuscus et haec utinam Viscorum laudet uterque.
Ambitione relegata te dicere possum,

Pollio, te, Messalla, tuo cum fratre, simulque

Vos, Bibule et Servi, simul his te, candide Furni,

77. explosa Arbuscula] This actress
has been mentioned before S. i. 2. 2 11.
[See Cic. ad Att. iv. 15, 6, written ac. 54.
Arbuscula was therefore not on the stage
now.] As she, when she was hissed off
the stage, said she cared nothing for the
rest of the spectator-S, and was satisfied if
she pleased the front benches (the equites),
so Horace says he only wishes to be read
in the better sort of schools, where that

class of people sent their sons.

“ 78. cimex Pantilius] Comm. Cruq.

text. A more contemptible animal could
not have been chosen to liken the man to,
whether for its odour, its skulking‚ or its
bite. So that δήγματα κορέων, λαθρόδακ-
ναι κόρεις, seem to have been proverbial
expressions for the calumnies of such
people. Philost. Vit. Soph. ii. 10. 1, and
Antiphanes, quoted from the Anthology
by J acobS, Lect. Ven. p. 394.

79. Demetrius] See above on v. -18, and
as to Fannius, see S. i. 4. 21 n. On Plo-
tius, see S. i. 5. 40, and on Valgius, C. ii. 9.
Int. Octavius is unknown. It has been
supposed that he was the person to whom
the poem Culex, attributed to Virgil, is
addressed. On Fuscus (to whom the epi-
thet ‘optimus' belongs), see C. i. 22. Int.,
and S. 9. 61, 01111 Epp. i. 10.

83. Viscorum laudet uberque] Here
Acron writes, “Visci duo fratres erant
optimi poetae. Alii dicunt criticos fuisse.
Pater eorum Vibius Viscus quamvis et
divitiis et amicitia Augusti clarus esset in
equestri tamen ordine perduravit.'' Comm.
Cruq. has much the same. If Viscus be
the correct reading in S. 9. 22 and S. ii.
8. 20, the persons there mentioned may be
one or other or both of these brothers.

[84. Ambitione relegata] See C. ii. 1,
and S. i. 6. 52n. ‘Laying aside all flat-
tery‚’ which is the interpretation of Lam-

binus. Heindorf interprete ‘ambitione’

by‘ vanity! As‘ ambitio’ means a eeek·

ing of favour and opinion, it may
either mean secking the favour of Pollio,
or the good opinion of the many by show-

ing an intimacy with this great man ς and
that would be vanity.]

85. tuo cumfratre] According to Estr6
this was Gellius Poplicola, Messalla’s bro-
ther by adoption. He was with Brutus
and Cassius in Asia Minor3 but leflz them
before the battle of Philippi, and joined
M. Antonius, and he commanded the right
wing of his army at Actium. (Dion. Cass.
xlvii. 24). If this be the person Horace
alludes to, his acquaintance with him began
in Brutus's camp. He was consul in the
year A. tr. c. ¹718. Orelli [and Ritter]
affirm that Messalla had a brother Q. Pe-
dius Poplicola (v. 28 n..)

86. Vos, Bibule et Servi] M. Calpur-
nius Bibulus, who was consalin A. π. c. 695
with C. Caesar, and through the influence
of Cn. Pompeius was appointed governor
of Syria in 703, when Cicero was governor
of Cilicia, had four sons, of whom two were
killed in Egypt while their father was in
Syria; one who was made legatus of Syria
by M. Antonius, soon aster the battle of
Philippi (at which he was present), and
who appears to have died 111 that province
shortly after he went there, and one who
was a little child (παιδίον μικρόν, Plut.
Brut. c. 13) when his mother Porcia mar-

ried M. Brutus, which could not have been ⁴

earlier than ΛΑΜ). 706, when the elder
Bibulus died. He wrote an account of
his stepfather’s life, which Plutarch made
use of. This is supposed to be the person
Horace alludes to. He must have been
still quite young, whichever date of those
that are proposed is adop ted. [Some
critics suppose that- there were only three
sons of the consul Bibulus; but tyhe son
whom Plutarch mentions (Brutus, c. 13)
