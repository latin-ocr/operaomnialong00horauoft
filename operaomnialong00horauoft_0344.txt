GARMEN XV.

This is probably a composition from the Greek, and I should think a pretty close
imitation. It is addressed to an imaginary Neaera by the poet in his own person. He
complains of her deserting him for a wealthier rival. Horace introduces the same
name in a much later ode (iii. 14. 21), and it is used throughout the third book of
Elegies commonly attributed to Tibullus. The ode is in Ovid’s style, and worthy to
have been written by him. By the same argument that is applied to Epode xi. (see
Introduction) Franke and Kirchner assign to this the date A.U.c. 721. Ι need not
repeat how widely such notions in my opinion depart from the true character of Horaoe’s
love poems.

ARGUMENT-

Remember that night when the moon was in the sky, aud thou didst swear fidelity vo
me, saying that so long as the sheep feared the wolf, and storms vexed the winter’s
sea, and Apollo' s looks floated' m the breeze, our mutual love should last. Thou shalt
rue my firmness, Neaera. Flaccus will bear no rival. Let thy faithlessness drive ι
him to wrath and he will seek a true heart elsewhere. Let him once learn to hate
thy beauty and he will be its captive no more, when grief shall have settled in his
soul. And thou, whosoever thou art, that boastest thyself in my sorrow, be thou rich
in flocks and fields, and let Pactolus run gold for thee ‚⁶ be thou wise in the secreta
of Pythagoras and of form more beautiful than Nireus ; yet shalt thou weep for her
love transferred to another, and my turn to laugh shall come.
