HORATII FLACCI

Si possum invidcor, cum lingua Catonis et Enni
Sermonem patrium ditaverit et nova rerum

Nomina protulerit?

Licuit semperque licebit

Signatum praesente nota producere nomen.

Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos,

Prima cadunt : ita verborum vetus interit aetas,
Et juvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque.
Debemur morti nos nostraque 3 sive receptus
Terra Neptunus classes aquilonibus arcet,

Regis opus, sterilisve diu palus aptaque remis

59. Siynatum praesente nota producere]
Bentley, from a very few MSS„ and against
his own as well as all the best and all the
editions, edits ‘procudere’ for ‘pi-educere:
which signifies to give currency to a word
stamped, says Horace, with a modern mark,
a metaphor plainly taken from the coinage
of the mint. Bentley, without authority,
substitutes ‘ nummum ’ for ‘ nomen?

60. Ut silvae foliis] ‘ As woods iu re-
spect of their leaves at the close of the year
are changed; the first fall ;’ [in which is
implied that other leaves come, as Kriiger
says]. There is a little irregularity in the
construction, but the meaning is clear.
Bentley conjectures “Ut silvis folia pri-
vos,'’ in which he defends the lengthening
of the last syllable in ‘folia ' by the ‘ pr’
that follows it, and for ‘ privos' in the sense
of ‘singulos ’ he quotes Lucretius (v. 275,

6:)3. Debentur morti nos nostraque]
Horace probably remembered the verses of
Simonides (Fr. 123, Bergk) :—

χαίρει τις Θεόδωρος ἐπεὶ θάνεν· ἄλλος ἐπ’
αυτ v
χαιρήσῖι· θανάτῳ πάντες ὀφειλόμεθα.

[‘ Debemus morti nos nostraque,' Ritter,
who says, ‘haec vera est loci scriptura a
Prisciano Servioque consentiente Beruensi
vetere servata? His reasons for preferring
‘ debemus ’ are not very strong]

of Baiae by a narrow causeway, the con-
struction of which tradition attributed to
Hercules (“ Herculeo structa labore via‚”
Prop. iii. 18. 4; “ Herculeum commendat
iter‚’' Silius xii. 118). Beyond the Lucri-
nus lay the Avernus lacus (lago (l'Averno),
a basin without any outlet, about a mile
and a half in circumference, and fed by
streams from Mons Gaurus (Monte Bar-
baro). The space between the two lakes
was covered with wood. In the war with

Sextus Pompeius, A.U.c. 71¹7, Augustus,
advised by Agrippa, to whom he had en-
trusted the task of reforming his fleet,
opened a communication between lacus
Avernus and the sea, whereby 118 made a
harbour in which he was able to practise
his fleet. This he called after himself
‘portus Julius? “ Portum Julium apud
Baias immisso in Lucrinum et Avernum
lacum mari effecit. In quo quum hieme
tota copias exercuisset Pompeium inter
Mylas et Naulochum superavit ’' (Suet.
Aug. 16). This is the work virgil allodes
to (Georg. ii. 161) :—

“An memorem portus Lucrinoque addita
claustra,'’ &c-

The basin of the Lucrine lake 1188 118811
filled up by the rising of a volcanic hill
(Monte Nuovo), and is now 8 swamp.
‘ Regis opus’ (like ‘regiae moles: C. ii.
15. 1) is a work worthy of a king. .
65. sterilisve diu palus] The MSS. and
editions vary between ‘que’ and ‘vel But
Horace does not mean to couple a number
of illustrations together, but to take any
one of them z whichever of these great
works you plesse to take, destruction surely
awaits it. How much more shall mere
words decay. The shortening of the penult
of ‘ palus’ is a ‘licentia sumpta pudenter:
and not met with elsewhere. Bentley and
others try to mend the passage to get rid
of this irregularity. What work Horace
here alludes to is very doubtful. . Comm.
Cruq. says : “ Pomptinas paludes Angustus
exsiccavit et habitabiles reddidit, injecto
aggere lapidum ac terrae.” Acron says
the same: “ Pomptinam paludem siccavit
nt admare meatum habere cogeret ut post et
arari posset.'’ That C. J uliusansar contem-
plated such a workvwe learn from Sueto-
nius (Caes. 44), and Plutarch (0888. 58).
That Aug-ustus may have contemplated it
likewise‚ and made the canal mentioned on
S. i. 5. 7, while that design was in his mind,
