Bentley. ‘ Lacrumosum' corresponds to
the δακρυόεις πόλεμος of Homer, and ‘lacru-
mabile bellum’ of Vix-gil.

14. et principe Caesare] Scaliger pro-
posed the omission of ‘ et‚' and some editors
have followed him, understanding Horace to
mean ‘ because Caesar is prince.' The con-
junction is stated by Kirchner (Nov. Qu. p.
57 n.) to be wanting in an old edition (1500)
by a Dutchman, Peter Van Os, which he
considers sufficient authority. It osten hap-
pens that when commentators get an edi-

tion to which others have not access they
give it undue weight from its rarity.
Kirchner cannot tell on what MSS. or
editions the Dutch editor depended, οι·
whether his omission of ‘ et ’ may not have
been a slip or conjecture of his own. The
conjunction here is iu accordance with a
practice very common with Horace, of
coupling a general and a particular object,
of which Dillenbr. has collected many in-
stannes, on C. i. 3. 19 :—
“mare turgidum et
Infames scopulos Acrooemunia.'’

GARMEN XXII.

A.U.c. 729 (Ρ).

See note on v. 15.

Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace’s, and the wag whom he repre-
sents as playing him false in his interview with the troublesome fellow he met on the
Sacra Via (S. i. 9. 61). Horace and he were

 

‘⁶ paene gemelli,

Frater-nis animis; quicquid negat alter, et alten⁴
Adnuimus pariter 3 vetuli notique columbi '’ (Epp. i. 10).
We know nothing more of him except from the statements of the Scholiasts, who make
out that he was a writer of tragedies 3 another says of comethes, and all that he was a
grammarian. It has also been doubted (from the confused statements of the Scholiasta)
whether Fuscus is not the person meant S. i. 9. 22, which runs in all the MSS.—
“ Si bene me novi non Viscum pluris amicum, ⁵

Non Varium facies.''

It is impossible to determine the date of the ode. We can only say that it was
written after Horace had got his country-house, that is, not earlier than suff-o. 720.
Fuscus, as usual, has not much to do with the ode, his name being bon-owed as that

of Sestius (C. 4) and others, and for the same purpose.
ARGUMENT.
An honest man, Fuscus, may go unarmed along the burning shores of Africa, over the

wild Caucasus or to the fabulous East.

’Twas there, as I wandered careless in the

woods singing of my Lalage, a wolf such as Apulia and Africa. rear not met me and
fied. Set me in the coldand stormy north, or in the burning and uninhabited

tropic, still will I love my smiling, pmttling Lalage.

(Aen. iv. 203)-; ‘praestans animi juvenis’
(Aen. xii. ⁴19), are all similar expressions.
