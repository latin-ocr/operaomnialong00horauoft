The two last lines of this ode, showing that Horace had not yet paid the sacrifice he
had vowed to Faunus for his preservation from death, make it most probable that it
was written not long after C. 13 of this book, the composition of which has been assigned
with some hesitation to A.U.c. 728. In the same year Maecenas appears to have reco-
vered from a bad attack of sever to which he was liable, and was received with applause

,in the theatre on his first appearance after his illnaes (C. i. 20. 3). But his recovery
seems to have been only partial ς and it would appear that Horace had to listen to his
complaints and apprehensions of death, his fear of which is said to have been great.

ARGUMEN T.

Why kill me with thy complaints P Ι cannot survive thee, Maecenas : one half of my
life being gone, how should the other stay behind ‘t‘ Ι have sworn to die with thee,
and the monsters of Heu shall not separate us. Our star is one and the same. The
power of Jove rescued thee from the adverse influence of Saturn on that day when
thou wert received with acclamations in the theatre, and Faunus at the same time
rescued me from death. Offer thy sacrifice and dedicate thy temple, and Ι will offer
my unpretending lamb.

CUR me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum est nec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.
Ah te meae si partem animae rapit 5
Maturior vis, quid moror altera,
Nec carus aeque nec superstes
Integer? Ille dies utramque
