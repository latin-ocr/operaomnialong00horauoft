L. Cocceius Nerva was a friend of Μ.

z Antonius, and was among those whom

Caesar found in Perusia when he took it
(Am. c. ¹713). He offered these persons no
indignity, bnt made friends of them, and
Cocceius seems to have become especially
intimate with Caesar without betraying
his friendship for Μ. Antonius. According
to Appian(13.c.v. 60 sqq.) it was this Lu-

ciusCocceius who by his tact and good sense

eihation which took place (Δ. u. c. 714) be-

tween his two friends. But Lucius had,

as Appian mentions, a brother, and these
two have been confoundcd. 'Hie brother-'s
name was Marcum whereas Appian men-
tions this Cocceius ex pyressl as Lucius.

32. Capitoque simul Fonteius] C. Fon-
teius Capito was deputed by Caesar on this
occasion, as being a particular ffiend of
Μ. Antonius, who aster-warda, as Plutarch
relates (Anton. 36), sent him, while he
was in Syria, to fetch Cleopatra thither
from Egypt. When Augustus laid down
the consulship in ΛΑΜ). 721, Capito was
appointed Consul Suffectus. He had a
son who was consul with Germanicus⁵
