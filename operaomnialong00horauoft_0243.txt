CARMINUM 111. 27. 20⁷

Sed vides quanto trepidet tumultu
Pronus Orion. Ego quid sit ater
Hadriae novi sinus et quid albus
Peccet Iapyx. 20
Hostium uxores puerique caecos
Sentiant motus orientis Austri et
Aequoris nigri fremitum et trementes
Verbere ripas.

Ξ find in the elegies of Ovid and Propertius, and there is no necessit-y to substitute
ξ noticed in the introduction. ‘ Vetat ' is the ‘Haedi ’ or ‘astri ' for ‘ Austri.’ ‘Astri ’ ap-
’ of Lambinus and Bentley after one pears in the Zimch MS„ but probably only
'x of the Vatican MSS. But ‘vetet ’ is re- from an error of the pen. Bentley suggests,

J ‘vetat-¹] The woodpecker was a bird of to shake with the lashmg of the waves, this

, diversion is common with the

m omen. But why should ‘ laevus’ convey
that meaning ? and why should ‘dexter’
signify ‘ propitious‚' when Cicero sa s just
the reverse P (See last ode, v. 5 n. The
confusion may have arisen from the dif-
ferent practice of the Greeks and Romans
in taking note of birds, the former facing
the north and the latter the south, as is
commonly supposed. But what is oon·
fusion to us was none to a Roman.

18. Pronus Orion] C. i. 28. 21. On
'albus Iapyx,’ see C. i. 3. 4 and 7. 15.

21. Hostium uxores] So in C. i. 21. 13,
he prays Apollo to turn away war, famine,
and pestilence from his country to her
enemies the Parthians and Britons. Such

ts, as
virgil (Georg. iii. 513), ‘Di meffiem piis
erroremque hostibus illum ;'’ and Proper-
tius (iii. 8. 20), “Hostibus eveniat lenta
puella meis :'' and Ovid (A. A. iii. 247),
“ Hostibus eveniat tam foedi causa pudo-
ris.” The Romans used ‘pueri ' for chil-
dren of each sex. ⁸ Oriens’ is not usually
applied to ι wind, but Horace so applies it,

could only be perceptible to those who were
on it, not to those at sea. [⁶ Ripis ε’ see
C. ii. 18. 22.]

28. Palluit] So ‘expalluit ' (Epp. i. 3.
10) and ‘ contremuit ’ (C. ii. 12. 8) are used
transitively. So Pers. (S. i. 124), “Iratum
Eupolidem praegrandi cum sene palles.'’
Id. v. 184, “recutitaque sabbata pallos?
In v. 26 Bentley changes ‘et’ into ‘at,’
saying there is opposition between the two
members of the sentence ς but there is not:
‘palluit’ is a consequence of ‘credidit-.'
[‘ qudae ι’ C. ii. 19. 2Ο.]

33. centum—Oppidis] See Epod. ix. 29.
The description is from Homer’s Κρήτην
ἑκατόμπολιν (Il. ii. 649). Europa's speech
is that of one just awake to her real posi-
tion aster the terror of her voyage, mid the
departure of her companion ; lest, alone in
a strange land with the consciousness of
her folly first coming upon her. She begins
distractedly, ‘Fathen alas! 1 have for-
feited a daughter's name, and love hath
given place to madness.'· ‘Filiae’ is tho
dative of the agent, [as Porphyrion οχ-
