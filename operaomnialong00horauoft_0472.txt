436 HORATII FLACCI SATIRARUM I. 10.

notices Cruquius has inferred that Horace alludes to C. Cornelius Gallus, the intimate
friend of all Horace's friends, and of virgil in particular (Ecl. x.). No opinion can be
more improbable than this. Out of the word ‘ Vivalium ’ (evidently corrupt) in Acron's
note, Bentley 1188 conjectured, with some appearance of probability, that Μ. Furius
Bibaculus is the person referred to. This poet, who was born at Cremona A.U.c. 652
(see Clinton F. H. sub an.), is mentioned with respect by Quintilian (x. 1. 96), and
classed with Catullus and Horace as a satirist. But Quintilian also quotes (viii. 6. 17)
with disapprobation the verse of this same person imitated by Horace in S. ii. 5. 41,
“ J uppiter hibernas cana nive conspuit Alpes.” The affectation noticed in this verse,
and continued perhaps in others that followed, may account for Furius's cognomen,
given him probably by his contemporaries generally and therefore sufficient for them
to recognize him by. Some think he is so called from 1118 birthplace, from which Acron
calls him ‘ Gallum poetam ε’ others because he wrote a poem (πραγματεία the Scholiasts
call it) on Caesar's Gallie war, from, which the above verse is taken. Bentley prefers
the first of these three reasons, and I agree with him. The epithet ‘turgidus’ applies
to his person, and is explained by the description given of him in the above place,
“pingui tentus omaso.” He is said to have murdered Memnon, and it is generally said
that this refers to a translation he is supposed to have made of the Aethiopis of Arcti-
nus, one of the cyclic poets, in which Memnon was one of the principal heroes. Dacier
suggests that he wrote a tragedy with this title, to which notion the following lines
give some probability. Horace says that Furius, like some rude artists, had made a
figure of Rhenus with a head of clay, referring to the statues by which the different
river gods were represented, and to some description this poet had given of the sources
Α of the Rhine, probably in the above poem on the Gallie war. There is a very different
representation of Rhenus on a medal of Drusus, in Oiselius' Thesaurus, Pl. 24, 6, where
he appears as 8 majestic figure, reclining with his left arm testing on his urn, and in
his right hand a reed partly broken ; which latter symbol appears to have been fami-
liar to Ovid, for he writes, describing the triumph of Tiberius, Aa). 12 (ex Pont. iii.

4. 107) . ‘⁶ squali dus immissos fracta sub arundine crines

Rhenus et infectas sanguine portet aquas.'’

‘ Defingo ' is to fashion out, and differs little from ‘fingo :² ‘diffingo’ (C. i. 35. 39 n.) 18
to break up and fashion anew. Nevertheless some MSS. and editions have ‘ diffingit'
here. Dillenbr. says this word “haud dubie reprehensionem continet ut simile verbum
deformare.'’ I do not agree with him. If ‘ deformare ' were substituted it would
either have the same meaning that I have given to ‘defingit‚' or it would signify dis-
figures, which sense the passage will not bear. There is a chapter in Gellius (xviii. 11)
111 which he defends Furius from the adverse judgment of Caesellius Vindex, who pro-
nounced him affected, and said he had spoilt the Latin tongue by the invention of new
words, of some of which he gives specimens. The heading of the chapter makes this
Furius to be Aulus Furius of Antium ς but as he was a poet held in high oetoem, and
one whom Virg‘il largely imitated (Macrob. Saturn. vi. 1), it 1188 118811 assumed that
“ Furii Antiatis,’' in the lemma to Gellius’ chapter, is a corrupt reading (Weichert‚
Poet. Lat. p. 350 sqq.). Whatever the merits of Furius of Antium may have been, it
is possible he may have used the expressions Gellius quotes, and they would not be more
or worse blemishes than one might find in most poems of the same length (1118 Α1111818
extended to upwards of eleven books) ς 81111 Ι 888 110 good reason for supposing Furius
Bibaculus to be meant. It is curious however that one of the affectations ascribed to
the poet Gellius refers to, is “quod terram in lutum versam ‘latescere' dixerit.” If
Bibaculus were the author of this expression we might imagine that it had stuck to his
name, and that Horace uses the expression ‘luteum caput’ as referring to this pru-
verbial reproach.
