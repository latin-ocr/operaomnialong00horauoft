unbidden, beautiful Bassai-eus, nor drag thy myster-ies from their secret places.

- Numa, Vare, sacra vite prius severis arborem
Circa mite solum Tiburis ct moenia Catili.
Siccis omnia nam dura deus proposuit, neque
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines.
Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat ’.Ρ 5
Quis non tc potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
At ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi
Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
Debellata‚ monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,-

Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum

Discernunt avidi. Non ego te, candide Bassareu,
Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus

Sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecyntio
Cornu tympana, quae subsequitur caecus Amor sui

Et tollens vacuum plus mmio Gloria verticem,

Arcanique ffides prodiga, perlucidior vitro.

“Tu ne quaesieris. ’']

2. Rbus-is et moenia Catili] ἓν διὰ
v δυοῖν. Seec- i. 7. l3n. Horace shortcns
the penultimate syllable of Catillus’ name,
and the same liberty is taken with the
name of Porsenna, Epod. xvi. 4 n.

8. uper mero] It is disputed whether
this meam ‘over their wine,' or ‘about
thar· wine? [‘Super’ with an ablative

but neither meaning will suit this pas·
page: See the Argument. Ritter ex-
plains it ‘ super mer01--humi effuso:
and he compares ‘snper foco‚’ ‘super
Pindo? but the comparison is not appro-
priate. At the marriage-feast of Peiri
thoas, ' of the Lapithae, the Centaurs,
being guest& attempted in their drunken-
nesato carry off the bride Hippodamia and
the other women present, which led to a
contest, and the Centaurs were beaten.
'eum’ (v. 10) refers to ‘super mero,' which
applices also to the Sithonians‚ a people of
Thrace, on the bordei-s of Macedonia. 'l'he
quan-el of Bacchus with the Thracians, on
account of Lycurgus' treatment of his
vines, and the habitnal drunkenness visited
Α upon them, are well known. See C. i. 27.

1 sq„ and ii. 19. 16.

10. Cum sas atque uffae] ‘When the
greedy of wine distinguish between right
and wrong by the slender line of their lusts‚’
that is, the slender distinction that lust so
inflamed can draw. ‘ Avidus ’ is used ab·
solntely for ‘ avidus pugnae‚’ C. iii. 4. 58.

12. quatiam] This is explained by Aen.
iv. 301 :—

 

“ qualis commotis excita sacris
Thyias ubi audito stimulant trieterica
Orgffiibztumusque vocat clamore Cithae-

where Servius in his commentary quotes
this passage of Horace. The whole pas-

which the thyrsus and the cista with its
sacred conten'ts (whatever they may have
been) and its covering of vine and ivy be-
longed. The picture of vain glory holding
high its head, full only of the fumes of
debauch, is very happy, whether original
or not. The other characteristic of the
maudlin state is repeated once or twice.
