Spectat Roma potens; habet hos numeratque poetas
Ad nostrum tempus Livi scriptoris ab aevo.
Interdum vulgus rectum videt, est ubi peccat.

Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas

Ut nihil anteferat, nihil illis comparet, errat :

quempiau1.'’ There are few like him now.
His name was P. Terentius Afer. He was
a slave in the family of one P. Terentius
Lucanus, whose praenomen and gentile
name he took on his manumission, retain-
ing as a cognomen the name which he de-
rived from the place of his birth, Carthage,
if the accounts we have of his life be cor-
rect. All his extant plays are ‘ palliatae ³
founded more or less on the Greek, and
chiefly Menander.

60. arcto stipata theatro] The plays of
Terence and all the earlier and more cele>
brated poets were performed at first either
on seafl'oldings erected in the Circus and

- afterwards taken down, or in temporary

wooden theatreS, usually on a very large
scale; the notion being that a systematic
encouragement of plays by the erection of
permanent buildings was injurious to pub-
lic morals. The first permanent stone
theatre at Rome (for they had them in the
country towns some time before) was built
by Cn. Pompeius after the Mithridatio war
outside the walls, near the Campus Mar-
tius, on the spot, as is supposed, now called
Campo di Fiore (Cramer). It held 40,000
people. There are no remains of it.
Augustus erected another near the Pons
Fabricium just outside the walls, to the
memory of his nephew Marcellus (of which
some remains are still visible), and by his
desire a third was built in the Campus
Martius by L. Cornelius Balbus. It is to
these three, the only theatres of the time.
that Ovid alludes (A. A. iii. 394), “ Visite
conspicuis terna theatra locis.’' See also

62. Livi scriptoris ab aevo] T. Livius
Andronicus is spoken of by Quintilian as
the first Roman poet, and without much
respect 2-“ Quid erat futurum si nemo
plus effecisset eo quem sequebatur Ρ Nihil
in poetis supra Livium Andronicum, nihil
in historiis supra Pontificum annales habe-
remus” (x. 2. 7). The date of his birth is
uncertain, but he wrote in the middle of

the third century B.c.‚ and died aas-c.
533, or thereaboutS. His first play was
represented the year before Ennius was
born, A.U.c. 514, as Cicero says on the
authority of Ennius (Brutus, c. 18). He
also says this was the first play put upon
the stage (all before had been extempore
performances). He is said to have been
born at Tarentum, which Niebuhr (iv. 260)
says is “ probably for no other reason but
because he was confounded with Livius
Macatus, who maintained himself at Taren-
tum'’ (Livy xxiv. 20; xxvii. 34). ‘¹ Livius
Andronicus translated the Odyssey, which
from its relation to Latium, had greater
attractions for the Romans than the Iliad :
he did not however translate the whole of
the Odyssey‚ but made an abridgment of
it in the national Italian rhythm, and not
in a Greek metre. All that Livius wrote
besides his Odyssey are tragedies which,
like the Atellanae, were not performed in
standing theatres, but on a kind of scaf-
foldiug in the Circus ’³ (Niebuhr, 1. c.). It
has been affirmed that he also wrote come-
dies (see his life in Dict. Biog.); and Livy
(xxvii. 37) mentions a hymn composed by
him. He probably composed others. (I do
not know on what authority Niebuhr says
the Odyssey had greater attractious for the
Romans than the Iliad. The reason he
assigna is hardly sufficient.) “ Livius An-
dronicus (Niebuhr adds) was the client of
one Livius.'' It is generally supposed he
was a freedman, having been taken prisoner
at Tarentum. His dramas were all, as far
as we know, ‘palliatae,' from the Greek.
Cicero says they were not worth a second
reading: “ Nam et Odyssea Latina est sic
tanquam opus aliquod Daedali, et Livianae
fabulae non satis dignae quae iterum le—

the harshness of the style, the second I
suppose the dulness of the matter. There
was a want of life he means about this old
poetry3 unless we prefer understanding
‘ignava’ ‘carelesslye A. P. 445. ‘Jove
aequo ’ is the opposite of ‘Jove non probante ’
(C. i. 2. 19).—[⁴ Credit :' ‘cedia’ Bentley.]
