. In the thirteenth ode of the second book Horaee relates how he was nearly killed by
the filling of a tree. In the seventeenth ode of the same book he associates this aeci-

ξ deren-mima if we ean determine that of C. iii. 8. It will be seen by referring to the
{3 inhoduetion to that ode that there is great differenee of opinion upon the subject, and
’ but small means of deeiding it. But upon the date of Maeoenas’ reeovery depends the
ι .. date of this ode, in which he is invited to drink some Sabine wine bottled on that oeca-
ῥ g aion. Now wine of this sortwas notinits prime under four years* keeping (C. i. 9. 7 n.),

ARGUMENT

Ἰ You shall have some poor Sabine, Maecenas, bottled at that time when the echoes of
’ the Vatimn resonnded your praise. You drink Caecuban and Calenian, b'ut the vines

of Falernum and Formiae are not for me.
