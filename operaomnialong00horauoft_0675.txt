Quem damnosa Venus, quem praeceps alea nudat,
Gloria quem supra vires et vestit et ungit,

Quem tenet argenti sitis importuna famesque,
Quem paupertatis pudor et fuga, dives amicus

Saepe decem vitiis instructior odit et horret:

Stultitiam patiuntur opes3 tibi parvula res est:

Arta decet sanum comitem toga; desine mecum

Certare.” Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat
Vestimenta dabat pretiosa: beatus enim jam
Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes,
Dormiet in lucem, scorto postponet honestum

Officium, nummos alienos pascet, ad imum

Thrax erit aut olitoris aget mercede caballum.
Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius unquam,
Commissumque teges et vino tortus et ira3
Nec tua laudabis studia aut aliena reprendess

Nec cum venari volet ille poemata paug-es.

31. Exin-apelia] Aristotle defines εὐτρα-
