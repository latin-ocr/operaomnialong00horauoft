libations. ‘ Guttus’ was a long thiu-necke‘d
bottle from which oil was poured very
slowly, drop by drop. It was also used in
libations, and these two vessels, as here
joined, have reference to the practice of
offering a libation at every meal to the
‘lares' See C. iv. 5. 29 n. These were
of earthenware which came from Campa·
nia. See S. ii. 3. 144, and Martial, xiv.

120. obeundus Marsya] Horace says he
goes to bed without the nervous feeling
that he must be up early to go to the
Forum, where a statue of Marsyas (the
unfortunate rival of Apollo) was erected
near the Rostra. Servius (on Aen. iv. 58,
“Legiferae Cereri Phoeboque patrique

ᾗ Lyaeo ⁵³) says that Lyaeus was properly

looked upon as the defcnder of liberty in
cities, and that for this reason the statue
of Marsyas his servant was set up in the
Sorum, with his arm lifted up, as a sign of
the freedom and wealth of the city in which
he is. According to Savigny (Vermischte
Schriften, i. 40), Marsyas or Silenus was
the symbol of a city having the J us Itali-
cum, one part of which was a free consti-
tution of its own. It would therefore
appear in the Forum as the symbol of free
jurisdiction. The only representations of
Marsyas that remain exhibit him either in

the agony of punishment, or in the sus-⁴

pense that preceded it. There is a fine
statue of him in the Grand dueal palace
at Florence, suspended to a tree, with his
arms fastened over his head, and his feet
scarcely able to touch the ground, while
his face shows great pain: and there is a
gem in the Massimi collection at Rome
(Agostini, Gemme Ant. p. ii. pl. 9), in
which he is represented as ticd to a tree,
expecting the knife, which Apollo (said to
bc meant for Nero, who, Suetonius says,
liked to be represented in the statues of
the gods and heroes, and particularly under
the person of Apollo, for he affected much
skill in music) is handing to a slave. The
same scene is represented alittle differently
in the collection of Gorlaeus (i. 111), where
the poor wretch has lost his skin, and is
writhing in agony, while the slave is re-
turning the knife to Apollo. On the other

side of this gem, which is engraved on both
sides, are the hcads of Nero and Poppaea.
Gronovius considers this to be the true
gem, and the other a clumsy copy. But
however this may be, “a Marsyas countc-
nance ’³ was synonymous with dejectiou
and ill humour. Thus Juvenal addi-esses
Naevolus (S. ix. 1) 1-

“Scire velim quare toties mihi, Naevole,
tristis
Occuzras„ fronte obducta, ceu Marsya
Vlc us. ·

So that, when Servius describes the statue

in the Forum (to which Martial alludes ii.

64), “—- fora litibus omnia fervent3
Ipse potest fieri Marsya causidicus‚”)

with his arms raised, it is probably a. sign
of extreme suffering ς and Horace seems
to indicate that his face was distorted, and
ascribes it humorouslyto his detestation of
the younger Novius, whom also, as Comm.
Cruq. says, he may mean to represent him
as threatening with his'uplifted arm. Who
this younger Novius was we cannot tell.
The Scholiasta say he was a usurer, and
intimate that he was of a family of usurers.
‘¹ Marsyam alteram habere manum erectam
ad depellendos N ovios, quod eorum foene-
ratorum impudentiam non posset sustinere’'
(Comm. Cruq.). Estre supposes him to be
the person mentioned in S. 3. 21, because
Maenius being a spendthrift, we may sup-
pose Novius to have been the reverse, and
so to correspond to the character of this
usurer. This does not help us much.
122. Ad quartam jaceo] This does not
mean that he slept till the fourth hour,
but lay in bed reading or thinking, as he
says above, S. 4. 133: “neque enim cum
lectulus aut me Porticus excepit, desum
mihi.” The first hour he considers late
enough for any man to sleep. Epp. i. 17.
