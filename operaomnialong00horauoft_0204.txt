Multi Lydia nominis

HORATII FLACCI

Romana vigui clarior Ilia.
Me nunc Thressa Chloe regit

Dulces docta modos et citharae sciens, Ιο
Pro qua non metuam mori

Si parcent animae fata superstiti.

Me torret face mutua

Thurini Calais filius Ornyti,

Pro quo bis patiar mori

15

Si parcent puero fata superstiti.
Quid si prisca redit Venus
Diductosque jugo cogit aeneo,

Si flava excutitur Chloe

Rejectaeque patet janua Lydiae? 20
Quamquam sidere pulchrior
Ille est, tu levior cortice et improbo

Iracundior Hadria,

Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.

afterwards, rather than have inserted it.
Orelli thinks just the reverse. Either con-
struction is correct (see C. ii. 4. 7 n.). On
‘⁶ multi nominis,'' see C. i. 36. 13.

[10. citharae sciens] ‘Sciens puguae‚’
C. i. 15. 24.]

12. Si pafrcent animae] Cic. ad Fam.
(xiv. 14): “Vos meae carissimae animae
quam saepissime ad me scribite.'’ Since
‘ metuam' here and ‘patiar ’ below (v. 15)
are the present subjunctive, ‘ parcent,’ fol-
lowing those words, should, in strict Lati-
nity, be ‘ parcant? But the same construc-
tion occurs in C. iii. 3. 7, where, how-
ever, some MSS. have ‘illabetur.’ Why
Chloe· should be a Thracian, and Ornytus a
Sybarite (Thurii was formerly Sybaris) is
not worth questioning. The reading Cressa
is properly rejected as harsh, and Ornithi,
which can only be derived from ὄρνιθος,
has the penult long. Both may have got
into the Scholiasts' text through the error
of transcribere. “ Cressa, Thracia,'' is
Acron’s note in Ascensius' text.

17. prisca] Forcellini gives other in-
stances of this use of ‘ priscus,' where ‘pris-
tinus' is more usual. ‘ Deductos‚' the read-
ing of the oldest Berne and one Leipzig
MS. quoted by Jani, could only be taken
with ‘jugo‚¹ and signify ‘ withdrawn from

the yoke,' which might be admitted by a
double construction of ‘jugo ’ with ‘ deduc-
tos’ and ‘ cogit?

19. excutitur] Bentley understands ‘ja-
nua' from the next line, following Acron,
who says, “ Excutitur: pro expellitur.”
Orelli says it is a metaphor taken from a
horse that throws its rider. The English
“ cast off’' expresses the meaning best.
On the meaning of ‘improbus’ as a word
expressing ‘excesS‚’ see C. iii. 24. 62. y

[22. levior] Ritter asks how ‘levior’
can be properly opposed to Calais, who is
‘ sidere pulchrior? His answer is that
Lydia assumes that a man ‘lighter than
cork’ and of two foot stature (S. ii. 3. 309)
cannot aspire to beauty. He adds that in
other cases ‘levis’ signifies an ineonstant,
unsteady person 3 but as ‘levis ³ is opposed
to the notion of beauty, it cannot signisy
the same here. 'rbus he takes the man to
be Horace, the woman to be a reality, and
Horace’s small weight and short stature
are contrasted with the beauty of calais.
Such a method of interpretation shocks
common sense and offenda good taste. If
a man can be called more ionate than
a stormy sea, he may also be called lighter
than coi-k, and nobody will doubt about
the meaning.]
