tanath ode of the fourth book is nominally connected with this3 but as there is no

exparimoe, so neither is it likely that he wrote that to taunt in her decline the girl
who is supposed to reject his addresses here. 'rbere is something ludicrous in Jani’s
distreus at the virulenee with which Horace could find it in his heart to attack a
woman he had once been so fond of.

ARGUMENT.

Were Scythia thy dwelling-plaee, Lyce, this inclement night should move thee to pity
me. Hear how the wind howls; see how the snow lies freezing. Venus loves not
pride ε the rope may break and the wheel run bacin though nothing bends thee,
neither presents, nor prayers, nor these wan eheeks of mine, nor thy husband's faith-
hamethough thou behardastheoakand cruel as thesei-penssyetasagoddess
have pity! Flesh and blood will not stand this for ever.
