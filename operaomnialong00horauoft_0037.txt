Q. HORATII FLACCI

OARMINUM

LIBER PRIMUS.

 

GARMEN Ι.
A.u.c. 730.

ann this ode is an introduction to one book or three is a question that has
been discumed and must be matter of opinion. 1 think it probable that the three
first books were published together, with this as a preface 3 and if the chronological
arrangement 1 have adopted (see Introduction) be correct it was written amne. '730;
but there is no internal evidence to lead to that conclusion. Bentley was of opinion
' tint ench book was produced separately. It is a gracefnl dedication to Maecenas of a
work, the composition of which had occupied and nmused the poet at intervals for some
years. It was probably at his patron's instigation that he arranged his fugitive picces
and put them forth in this collected form. There is a mixture of real affection with
the usual dedicatory flnttery in this ode, the leading idea of which, as in most cases,
Horace probably borrowed from the Greek. There is a fragment of Pindar(201 Bergk),
preserved in Sextus Empiricos, which with others Horace may have had in mind, and
it will account for the somewhat incongruous allusion to the Olympic games in the
beginning of this ode. It is the only way of explaining the allusion to an almost obso-
lete practice, to bear in mind that this was the chief theme of Pindar's poetry. The
fragment runs thus :—

ἂελλσπᾶδοη μέν τιν’ εὐφραίνουσιν ἶπον

τίμια καὶ στέφανοι· τοὺς δ’ ἐν πολυχρύσοις θαλάμοις βιοτά·

τέρπεται δὲ καί τις ἐπ’ οἶδμ’ ἅλιον ναῒ θοᾷ

aas διαστείβων .....

Δ fragment of Archilochus (33 Bergk), from Clemens Alexandrinus, runs:

ἄλλ’ ἄλλος ἄλλῳ καρδίην ἰαίνεται.
But the sentiment is common enough, and with the exception of the first illustration
Horace has put the subject in his own way and given it a Latin dress. It will be

“ observed, that while the leading sentiment is the common-place “different men have

different tastos,'’ Horace selects only the pursuits of worldly or mechanical minds to

conti-ast (not without some contempt) with his own higher ambitiou. He had, no

doubt, in his memory V'u-gil's lines (Georg. ii. 503, sqq.): “ Sollicitant alii remis freta
