the Romans professed to know nothing
about. 1 have already drawn attention to
the proneness of some editors, who do not
understand their legitimate province, to
throw upon the dishonesty of copyists the
defects they profess to find in their au-
thor (C. iii. 11. 17; 111. 17, Introduction).

Per Siculas equitavit undas.

‘Fortibus et bonis' corresponds to the com-
mon Greek expression which it is so diffi-
cult to render, καλοῖς κάγαθοῖς. Τ11050
words are in the ablative case. Orelli has
quoted several instances of their use by
Cicero. Among others, see Cic. 111 Verr. 11.

thority as ‘revictaess and has not its

cadunt vires aliqua ratione revictae,’' and
Cicero pro Sulla (c. 1), “perditi cives
redomiti atque victi.'' ‘Revictae’ is the
true reading, and nobody will think it ne-

worthy father of the two youths whom
Augustus had adopted, and one of whom
(Drusus) was believed, not without reason,
to be his own son. ‘ Indecorant’ and ‘de-

good MSS. The less likely form to have
