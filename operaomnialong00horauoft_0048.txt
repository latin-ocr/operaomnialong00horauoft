12 x HORATII FLACCI

Sive mutata juvenem figura
Ales in terris imitaris, almae
Filius Maiae, patiens vocari

Caesaris ultor ε

Serus in caelum redeas diuque ⁷ 45
Laetus intersis populo Quirini3
Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

Ocior aura

Tollat: hic magnos potius triumphos,
Hic ames dici pater atque princeps, 50
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos

Te duce, Caesar.

41. juvenem] So Augustus is called,
though he was forty years old at this time.
So Virg. (G. i. 500):—

“ Ηιιειὲιὲἑῖἰὺεω everso juvenem succurrere

Ne prohibete-’³

‘ J uvenis ’ and ‘adolescens’ were used for
ἓῗέεἰέῐζὲἓζῖῐῖ ιὲιὲἓέἰῗὲε 33015323932
the time he put down Catiline’s conspiracy,
when he was sowy-four years old, and as
‘senex,'when he delivered his an Philippic,
at which time he was sixty-two. “ Defendi
Rem publicam adolescens, non deseram se-
nex '' (Phil. ii. 46). But the reader will
find many examples in Forcellini, under the
articles ‘adolescens' and ‘juvenis.'

[43. Filius is supposed by Ritter to be
for the vocative]

patiens vocari] A Graecism. “ Patiar-
que vel inconsultus haberi ” (Epp. i. 5. 15) ς
“Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vo-
cari'' (Epp. i. 16. 30).

44. Caesaris ultor] Estre, a very dili-
gent scholar and candid man, declares
himself perfectly unable to account for
this language of Horace. It confounds
and disturbs, he says, all his notions of
Horace's character (Prosop. p. 277). See
Introduction to this ode.

45. Serus in eaelum redeas] Ovid, Met.
xv. 868, sqq. :—

“ Tarda sit illa dies et nostro serior aevo
Qua caput Augustum quem temperat
orbe relicto
Accedat caelo.”

See also Trist. v. 2. 47. The adjective for
the adverb is common in respect of time.
The instances in Horace are numerouS.
46. populo Quirini] Some MSS. have
Quirino. But the genitive is the general
reading, aud corresponds better to the re-
gular form ‘populus Romanus Quiritium?

49. triumphos] Augustus had just cele-
brated, or was just about to celebrate, three
triumphs on three successive days, for his
victories (1) over the Pannoniam and Dal-
matians, (2) at Actium, and (3) at Alex-
andria. ‘ Triumphos' is governed by ‘ames,'
as ‘pocula’ is governed by ‘spernit’ (i. 1.
19) ; in both which cases we have an accu-
sative case and an infinitiva mood governed
by the same verb.

50. pater] The title of ‘pater patriae’
was not assumed by Augustus till ⁴&AT-c.
752. ovid addi-esses him by that title
(Fast. ii. 127) :—

“Sancte pater patriae, tibi plebs, tibi curia
nomen
Hoc dedit ; hoc dedimus nos tibi
nomen eques.
Res tamen ante dedit. Sero quoque vera
tulisti
Nomina ι jampridem tu pater orbis
eras.

Hoc tu per terras quod in aethere Jupiter

Nomen habes ς homiuum tu pater,
ille Deum.’'

It was the highest title of honour that
could be conferred on a citizen, and was
first given by the Senate to Cicero (the
army had formerly bestowed it on Camil-
lus), on the occasion of his suppressing
Catiline’s conspiracy. J uv. viii. 243 :—

“ Sed Roma parentem,

Roma patrem patriae Ciceronem libera

dixit,''

where ‘libera ' seems to mean that the
senate was no longer free when Augustus
took the name. See C. iii. 24. 27 n. ’

princeps] Tac. Anu. i. 1, “Cuncta dis-
cordiis civilibus fessa nomine principis sub
imperium accepit.”

51. equitare inultos] See above, v. 21 n.
