HORATII FLACCI

Audiet cives acuisse ferrum
Quo graves Persae melius perirent3

Rara juventus.

Imperi rebus? prece qua fatigent

as Hannibal approaches the Anio. That
there were two legends, therefore, in this
as in most mses, must be admitted. Cru-
quius' commentator gets rid of the diffi-
culty in true Scholiast fashion by saying
that Ilia was buried by the banks of the
Anio, which carried her remains away,
and washed them into the Tiber3 and
hence she was said to have been married
to the Tiber. Servius (on Aen. i. 277)
remarks on Horace’s version, which he
51²3„'ismifiss’fmssssifflss“Effffssmnbe‘sshffg
says,
“ Palla graves humeros velat quam neverat
uxor
Ilia, percurrens vitreas sub gurgite telas.''

(In Prob. et Olyb. Cous. 224.) Jove may
be supposed to have disapproved the pre-
sumption of the river-god, because he had
reserved the task of expiation for other
hands and happier means. [As to ‘ uxorius‚’
comp. virgil, Aen. iv. 266. The same
division as in ‘u-xorius' occurs in C. i.
25. 11, C. ii. 16. 7.]

21. cives acuisse serrum] ‘ inter se' or
‘in semetipsos’ is readily understood.
Mitscherlich and others make ‘audiet
acuisse’ a prophecy, ‘shall hear them
sharpen: whereas it should be rendered
‘shall hear of their having sharpened.'
Horace is lamenting what has been.

Persians, Medes‚and Parthians are names
freely interchanged by Horace. The growth
of the Parthian power from the condition
of an insignificant dependency to the ab·
sorption of nearly the whole of the vast
empire of the Seleucidae, is a question of
history which need not be entered upon
here. It will be borne in mind however
with reference to the above confusion of
names that the Parthian empire, at the
time Horace wrote, extended nearly from
the Indus to the Roman province of Syria ,-

and that the Parthians were in the habit of
making incursions into that province, which
fact is referred to in the last stanza of this
ode. Although the name of Augustus,
assisted by their own disputes, did some-
thing towards keeping them in check,
they were held by the Romans to be their
most formidable enemies‚ as the readers of
Horace will easily perceive. Augustus
meditated‚ but never carried on war with
the Parthians, and the Romans never till
the reign of Trajan gained any successes
against them. Their empire was broken
up and succeeded by the Persian king·
dom of the Sassanidae during the reign of
Alexander Severus, Ad). zze—The open-
ing of Lucan's first book may be compared
with this ode.

24. Rara juventus] It took years of
peace and the enactment of stringent
marriage-laws to restore the population of
Rome, which was thinned not only by
bloodshed but by indifferenoe to marriage
and laxity of morals.

25. Quem vocet divum] The passionate
appeal of the chorus in Aesch. S. c. Theb„
beginning v. 92: τίς ἄρα ῥύσεται, τίς ἄρ’
ἐπαρκέσει θεῶν ἢ θεᾶν ; may be compared
with this. Vesta, the tutelary goddess of
Rome (Virg. G. i. 499, sqq.

“ Dii patrii Indigetes, et Romule, Vestaque
mater,
Quae Tuscum Tiberim et Romana palatia
, servas ’'),

is represented as deaf to the prayers of
her virgins, because Caesar as Pontifex
Maximus had particular charge of her
temple and rites. So in Ovid she ex-
ela1m5‘2meus fuit ille sacerdos 3
Sacrilegae telis me petiere manus.—
At quicunqne nefas ausi prohibente deo-
Xdiiitixiie polluerant pontificale caput,
