HORATII FLACCI

Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum :

Si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, jus est

J udieiumque.” “ Esto, si quis mala ς sed bona si quis
J udice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis

Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse ‘?’'

“ SolVentur risu tab-ullae, tu missus abibis)J

from Suetonius (Octav. c. 55) z “ Id modo
censuit cognoscendum posthac de iis qui
libellos aut carmina ad infamiam cujuspiam
alieno nomine edant.'' When Trebatius
says there is ‘jus judiciumque,’ he means
that there is law and also there are legal
proeeedings for this case. ‘Ne forte’ is
used as in C. iv. 9. 1, where see note, and
compare Epp. i. I. 13, 18, 58 ; ii. 1. 208.
85. latraverit] There is a good deal in
what Bentley says in favour of ‘ laceraverit?
which word he adopts. Lambinus had

put for the judices, as representing the
laws. Orelli takes ‘ tabulae ’ for the ‘ta-
bellae judieiariae,’ the votiug· tablets‚ re-
ferring to the sentence quoted above
(v. 79) from Cicero. 'rhe general meaning
is that the matter will be treated as un·
worthy of serious consideration 3 the ju-
dices will laugh at the joke and aequit the -
defendant. 1 think with Orelli that the
‘tabulae' are the tablets by which they
declared their votes and that Trebatius is
supposed to say that the votes of the

some MS. authority for it, and Heindorf judices will be decided by the amusement

adopts it. But ‘latraverit' appears in
nearly all the MSS. and editions, and the
Scholiasts had that word, which is less
likely to have been invented than the other.
‘Latro' is ussed as a transitive verb in
Epod. v. 58, and Epp. i. 2. 66, and therefore
it may bebere, which Bentley does not deny.

86. Solventur risu tabulae] Comm.
Cruq. was as perplexed with this expres-
sion as modern commentatorS. He says
“vel subsellia ; vel leges XII tabularum;
vel judices non erunt in eum severi?
Acron explains ‘tabulae' by ‘subsellia,’
by which he means that the benches of
the judices would split with their laughter

of the scene, or else that the severity of
their votes will be melted by the fun.
[Rit-ter has here one of his wonderful
notes: ‘tabulae sunt quae cera illitae et
notis C aut A aut N L inscriptae in
causis quaestionum capitalium iudicibus a
praetore quaestionis praeside dantur. Ha-
rum cera ridentibus iudicibus et prae risu
sudantibus in manu dissolvetur ut lit-
terae legi non possint, quo facto reus
dimittetur!

Doederlein, who has sometimes a. good
note‚' says that the text is equivalent to
‘ absolvetur reus cum risu per tabulas iudi-
ciarias; tu dimissus abibis3' and he adds

that in this construction the object which
is in the mind is not mentioned, and in
its place another member of the proposi-
tion, for instance, an instrumental member,
is made the object. He illustrates this
remark by various examples, of which
‘ pontem iungere’ is one of the best.]

if there were a prosecution in such a. case,
like that expression in Juvenal (i. 13):
‘⁸ assiduo ruptae lectore columnae.” The
second of the above explanations (“ leges
XII tabularum'') is adopted by Doering,
Dillenbr., and Zeuni. Lambinus inclines
to the same, or thinks ‘tabulae' may be

SATIRE ΙΙ.

Of Ofella, the person into whose mouth Horace puts the chief part of thqpreoepu
contained in this Satire, we know no more than we may gather from the satire itself, ¹
that in Horace's youth he was the owner of an estate near Venusia, and that his property
was taken from him and made over to one of the veteran soldiers named Umbrenus (v.
133), and that he afterwards rented, as ‘ colonus‚' afarm on that estate which was once
his own. This transfer took place in all probability when the troops returned to Italy
aster the battle of Philippi, A.U.c. 712, nt which time (among several other districts) the
Venusinus ager was distributed among the soldiers. It has been supposed that Horace
visited his native place, and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella, on his return from
Brundusium (Introduction to S. i. 5, sub. fin.). The old man, unchanged by the
rever-ses of fortune, industrious and uncomplaining, exhorting his sons to frugality and
