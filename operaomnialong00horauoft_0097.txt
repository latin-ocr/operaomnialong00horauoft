CARMINUM 1. 27 61

Nam in usum laetitiae scyphis
Pugnare Thracum est: tollite barbarum
Morem, verecundumque Bacchum
Sanguineis prohibete rixis.
Vino et lucernis Medus acinaces 5
Immane quantum discrepat: impium
' Iaenite clamorem, sodales,
Et cubito remanete pressa
Voltis severi me quoque sumere
Partem Falerni ’.Ρ Dicat Opuntiae
Frater Megillae quo beatus
Volnere‚ qua pereat sagitta.
Cessat voluntas ’.Ρ Νοιι alia bibam
Mercede. Quae te cunque domat Venus
Non erubescendis adurit
Ignibus ingenuoque semper
Amore peccas. Quidquid habes age
Depone tutis auribus. Ah miser,
Quanta laborabas Charybdi,
Digne puer meliore flamma!
Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis poterit deus ⁴?
Vix illigatum te triformi
Pegasus expediet Chimaera.

in Tacitus and Sallust, and ‘mirum quan-

Cicero, and Livy (ii. 1 fin.). The oldest

eative mood is nght‚‘ immane quantum’

10. Quintiae] The birthp lace of Me-
gilla(the Locrian Opus) is added, as Butt-
mann remarks, only “to give the poem a
fresher look of individuality. ” The same
remark will apply' ιιι other instancoe, aS, for
instance, “Xanthia Phoceu '³ (C. ii. 4. 2).

19. laborabas] Several MSS. have ‘la-
boras Charybdi' against the metne5 one or
two have inserted the preposition ‘'in to
make the verse straight, but the oldest and
best MSS. have the imperfect tense, of
which Bentley can make nothing. Orelli
