INTRODUCTION.

Tmz materials for Horaoe3s life are derived almost entirely from his
own works. A few additional facts are got from a short memoir
attributed to Suetonius. .

He was born on the 8th December, A.U.c. 689 (13.c. 65), at or near
Venusia¹ (Venosa), in the Apennines, on the borders of Lucania and
Apulia. His father was a freedman', having, as his name proves, been
the slave of some person of the Horatia gens. As Horaoe implies that
he himself was ingenuus', his father must have obtained his freedom
before his birth. He afterwards followed the calling of a coactor⁴‚ a
collector of money in some way or other, it is not known in what. He
made in this capacity enough to purchase an estate, probably a small
one, near Venusia. We hear nothing of his mother, except that Horace
speaks of both his parents with affection ⁵. His father, probably seeing
signs of talent in him as a child, was not content to have him educated
at a provincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) to Rome, where he became a pupil of Orbilius
Pupillus⁶, who had a school of much note, attended by boys of good
family, and whom Horace remembered all his life as an irritable teacher,
given unnecessarily to the use of the rod. With him he learnt grammar,
the earlier Latin authors, and Homer. He attended other masters (of
rhetoric, poetry, and music, perhaps) as Roman boys were wont, and
had the advantage (to which he afterwards looked back with gratitude)
of his father’s care and moral training during this part of his education.
It was usual for young men of birth and ability to be sent to Athens to
finish their education by the study of Greek literature and philosophy
under native teachers ; and Horace went there too, at what age is not
known, but probably when he was about twenty. Whether his father
was alive at that time or dead is uncertain. If he went to Athens at
