islike‘ de nocte' in Epp. i. 2. 32, ‘media
de luce? Epp p. i. 14. 34. Professor Key
thinks thatp in this use of‘ de' the notion
of a part of time is contained, and that it
may therefore be bestrendered by our pre-
position‘ by: or‘ in the course of’ (L. G.
lm, ἦ). ‘De medio die’ means ‘aster
mid—day? but· ιιι some cases it must note
proximity to mid-day, or it would have no
meaning. [SeeS. ii. 3. 238ιι.]

- reading, and that‘ die’ is his gloss upon

it. There· is sufficient authority therefore
for‘ da: though there is much more for
the other. Bentley sayys ‘da' is only the
interpolation of“ pexus nescio quis magi-
atellae? who found it iu Virgx 1 (Ecl. i.
19)‚· ‘sed tamen iste Deus qui sit da,
Tityre, nobis‚” and therefore thought
Horace must have used the same word.
He is verv angry with the ‘ignotus
homuncio: but as the MSS. have come
to his assistance the word may be re-
ceived, and it is Ι think a good one.
Terence uses it: “Nunc quam ob rem
has partes didicerim paucis dabo” (Heaut.
Prol. 10). From the meaning of this
word, ‘to put‚’ this applicatiou of it is
easily derived. [Ritter has‘ dic. ³]

5. iratum ventrem placaverit] Compare
S.2.18:“1.atrantem stomachum? Both
passages put together suggest the idea of
a epp thrown to an angry dog to keep him
quiet. Perhaps that notion‚ οι· something
of the sort, s this line. ‘-Placa
verit’ is a. more suitable word than the

reuiing ‘pacaveritss 'It applies better to

ιι. No mention is made of a ‘promulsis'
(S. i. 3. 6 ιι.), and the things of which
it was usually in a great measure com·

were sent up in the same dish
with the bear, which was generally served
whole, and was the chief dish, ‘caput
coenae. ' 'rm-nipe, lettuces, radishes, pars-
nips, with pickles and sauces of vari·
ons deseri ptions (S. 4. 73 n.,) generally
formed part of the‘ gustus’ or ‘promul-
sis' which preceded the ‘fercula’ or
com-ses of which the regular‘ eoena’ cou-
sisted. The boar was killed, the host
(called ‘ coenae pater ' with a sort of moek
respect) infor-med his guests, when the
south wind was not at its worst, meaning,
I suppose, that when this wind (‘ scirocco ’)

’ was blowing hard the meat would soon

spoil‚ if he had any meaning at all.

threw away the bones and other parts of
their food that they did not eat: such
were‘ ‘the crumbs that fell from the rich

eostly (S. 2. 4 n..) but not shabby as

Orelli says. I understand such tables are
favourites in good Italian houses still.
