514 , · HORATII FLACCI

Satire was written. In v. 40 he says that upwards of seven years had passed since he
became intimate with Maecenas; add to that the nine months that el apsed between his
first introduction and his recall (S. i. 6. 61), and we bring the former event to the
beginning of A.U.c. 716. How long he had been in possession of his Sabine estate wc
cannot gather from this Satire ; but there is nothing in it to disturb the opinion that it
was presented to him either in Amne. 721 or 722. He speaks familiarly of a country
life no doubt, but one or two seasons there would give him a sufficient taste of that way
of living to account for any expressions in this poem. · ·

ARGUMENT.

The height of my desires used to be a small bit of ground with a garden, a running
stream, and a little wood to crown them all. I have more than Ι asked, and Ι ask no
more, thou son of Maia, than that these may be mine for ever. If 1 have neither
increased my store by dishonesty, nor am likely to waste it through vice or neglect,—
if 1 am content with that Ι have, nor have prayed for a slice of my neighbour’s field,
nor sighed for hidden treasure‚——I ask thee to fatten my flocIm, and all 1 have but my
wits, and be with me, my mighty protector.

(v. 16.) Now that I have retreated to my castle in the mountains‚ what subject is worthier
of my muse than the spot where I escape from the suares of ambition and the pestilent
winds of autumn P

(v. 20.) J anuS, be thou the beginning of my song. At Rome thou hurriest me to the
Forum. ‘Haste‚ lest any be at the post of duty and friendship before thee ε’ and
so in all weathers Ι must go. And when the business is over and I have given my
promise, 1 must struggle through a crowd, and be cursed and taunted with ‘ Whatare
you about, mad fellow P Are you to be thrusting every one out of your way to get
back with all haste to Maecenas Ρ And this tickles my vanity, I confess. And when
I get to my friend's‚ hundreds of coinmissions come dancing before my mind.
‘ Roscius entreated you to be early at the Puteal to-morrow.’ ‘ The Scribae wanted
you to attend their meeting very specially to-day.’ ‘ Miud Maecenas puts his scal
to this diploma.' ‘ l’ll try? ‘ You know you can if you like.'

(v. 40.) It is nearly eight years since Maecenas began to take notice of me, just to the
extent of taking me with him into the country, and talking of most common-place
topics. From that day envy has been growing upon me. If Ι go with him to the
games or the Campus Martius, ‘ Son of Fortuue !’ cry they all. Is some bad news
abroad, every body comes to me for information‚ and if 1 profess ignoranoe, ‘ 011 you
are laughing at us ; you must know? ‘ Are the soldiers to have their landsin Sicily
or Italy Ρ ’ Though I swear Ι know no more than they do, they only think me the
closest of mortals. And so my life is wasted, aud I cry, O country, when shall Ι
behold thee again, and quaff forgetfulness of care in the midst of my books, with quiet
nights and idle days, and light repasts, and pleasant friends, with the wine-cup fiee
and conference of soul, and the'prattle of our good old Cervius.

(v. 78.) A good story was that he told us when one commended the wealth of the miser
Arellius, little knowing the anxiety it eost him.

‘¹ Once upon a time,'' said he, “ a country mouse entertained a city friend in his bole:
a shrewd thristy mouse, but hospitable nevertheless. Well, he put before his fi-iend
the best he had,—pulse and oats, and dry grape stenes, and nibbled bits of lud—to
tempt his dainty palate, while he himself ate nought but coarser grains. Then at
length says the gentleman from the town, ‘ How canst thou endure, my friend, to live
in these wilds? Wouldst thou not prefer the haunts of man to these rough woods?
Then haste, come back with me 3 life is short ς we all must die ’ς live cheerfully while
thou mayest? So the clown jumps up, and off they set for the city. Τ1ιθ night was nt

its noon when they entered the rich man’s house, where the bright cover-lid clothed the .
