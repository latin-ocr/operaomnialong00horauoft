HORATII FLACCI

Agricolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati,

Condita post frumenta levantes tempore festo 140
Corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem, ·
Cum sociis operum, pueris et conjuge fida,

Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,

Floribus et vino Genium memorem brevis aevi.

Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem 1⁴5

root signifying ‘good,’ for none but the
good could become Manes. But Angustia
(de Civ. Dei, ix. 11) quotes the authority of
Plotinus (for whom it appears he should
have said Apuleius de Socratis Daemone)
for saying “animas hominum daemonas
esse, et ex hominibus fieri Lares si boni
meriti sunt ; Lemures si mali seu Larvas3
Manes autem deos dici si incertum est bo·
norum eos seu malorum esse meritorum?
This the name itself disproves. Their
existence was a matter of some scepticism,
as observed on C. i. 4. 16. Here the name
seems to embrace all the infernal deities,
as Dis, Proserpina, Tellus, the Furiae, ὅτε.

143. Tellurem porco] The temple of
Tellus in the Carinae has been mentioned
” before, Epp. i. ’7. 48 ιι. She was wor-
shipped among the ‘dii inferi' or Manes.
Her annual festival, the Fordicidia, was
celebrated on the l5th of April. ‘ Forda'
in the old language signified a cow. See
Ovid (Fast. iv. 629 sqq.) :——

“ Tertia post Veneris cum lux surrexerit
Ροξιῖῗὲἑθε forda sacra litate bove.
Forda ferens bos est fecundaque, dicta
Hifiiigeaigrn foetus nomen habere putant.
Nunc gravidum pecus est ς gravidae nunc
semine terrae ;
Telluri plenae victima plena datur.'’

Sacrifices were also offered aster harvest,
and the victim was a hog, which was com-
monly offered to the Lares (C. iii. 23. 4,
where the feminine is used. S. ii. 3. 165.
C. iii. 17. 5. Epp. i. 16. 58).

-—- Silvanum lacte piabant] In Epod.
ii. the offerings to Silvanus are fruits‚ and
there heis spoken of as ‘tutor finium: ·' in
Tibullus (i.5 .27) he 1s called ‘deus agri-
cola‚’ and the offerings are different for
wine, corn, and flocks, all of which he

protected.

“ Illa deo sciet agricolae pro vitibus uvam,
Pro segete spicas, pro grege ferre
dapem.”
Juvenal (vi. 447) mentions a hog as an
ofl'ering to this god, to whom women were

not allowed to sacrifice, as appears from
that passage. He is re presented with a
pruning hook ιιι one hand, and a basket of
fruit and a cypress boug h in the other.
The last is connected with a story of his
killing a hind which belong ed to Cyparis-
sus, who died of grief* ιιι consequence.

344. Genium memorem brevis aevi] Epp.
i. 94 n.

145. Fescennina per hunc inventa licen-
tia] Bentley, on no authority bnt on the
suggestion of Bai-thius, reads ‘invecta.'
All the MSS. have ‘ inventa! There was a
sort of rude jesting dialogus carried on in
extempore verse at these rustic festivals,
full of good· tempered raillery and coarse
humour. These were called‘ Fescennina
carmina,' as is generally supposed from the
town Fescennia or Fescennium, belonging
to the Falisci (Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. ι. 136).
Other etymologies have been given (For-
cell.). From these versae others took their
name, which were more licentious and scur-
rilous. Epithalamia, usually ofan obscene
character, were called ‘ Fescennini versus’
(Catullus lxi. 126, in Nuptias Juliae et
Manlii :—

“ Neu diu taceat procax
Fescennina locutio ”),

and satir-es got the same name, bnt the sort
of poetry with which it orig-insted was
hai-mlesS, as Horace says (compare Virgil,
Georg. ii. 385) :—

‘Necnon Ausonii, Troja gens missa, coloni
Versibus incomptis ludunt risuque soluto;
Oraque corticibus sumunthorrenda cavatis ⁵
Et te, Bacche, vocant per oermina laeta,
Tibullus (ii. 1. 51) refers to the songs of
the rustics at harvest time :—

“ Agricola assiduo primum satiatus aratro
Cantavit certo rustica verba pede ς
Et satur arenti primum est modulatus
Caii-xciiii ut ornatos diceret ante deos.
Agricola et minio suffusus, Bacche,
Prinlibuiniiiexperta duxit ab arte choros.'’

[‘ Accepta :’ ‘ welcomed,’ ‘ agreeable.’]
