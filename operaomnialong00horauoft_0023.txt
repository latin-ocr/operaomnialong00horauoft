When we have long been accustomed to a reading, it is very dif-
ficult to accept another, even if there is better evidence for it, and
good reasons. Thus in C. ii. 20. 13, Keller has ‘jam Daedaleo
notior Icaro.’ I hardly know whether ‘ ocior ’ or ‘ notior ' is sup-
ported by the better evidence. Perhaps ‘notior’ is ; and if we
accept it, we escape the ‘ Daedaleo ocior.' Still partly from habit,
and partly for other reasons, Ι am not yet reconciled tc ‘ notior.’

In C. iii. 4. 9, ‘ altricis extra limen Apuliae,’ the question of
‘ Apuliae' is hotly deba‘oed. 'Phe word ‘Apuliae ' following ‘Apulo ’
is not the kind of repetition which seems to me to be an argument
against ‘ Apuliae ς’ nor is the argument derived from the quan-
tity of the first two syllables in ‘Apuliae' conclusive. It is a
case in which critics may differ3 but ‘ Apuliae' is now generally -
condemned. There is a note on this passage.

The boldest attempt at alteration that I know is in C. iii. 24. 4:
‘Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulicum‚’ where Keller has ‘ ter-
renum omne tuis et mare publicum,’ and Ritter has ‘Tyrrhenum
omne tuis et mare Ponticum.’ Bentley has said nothing against
the common reading. ‘ Terrenum’ is Lachmann’s. It is quite plain
that Horace, according to his fashion, would use a proper name here,
and the MSS. have ‘ Tyrrhenum’ or some equivalent form. Ithink
it is equally plain that the verse would end with some other proper
name, and ‘Ponticum’ is supplied by some manuscripts. Others
have ‘pulicum‚' ‘ publicum,’ ‘ apulicum,' ‘ pimicum? Here is a
case of real difficulty, but it is a most perverse selection to choose
‘ publicum,’ when we plame require the name of a sea contrasted
with the ‘ Tyrrhenum? If the difficulty about ‘Apulicum’ is in-
superable, we must take ‘ Ponticum,' which being a proper name
answers one demand of the text, but does not satisfy in other
respects, for we want the name of a sea corresponding to ‘ Tyrrhe-
num'instead of being carried off to the Euxine.

Habit accustcms us to things which at first seem strange. ‘ Mare
