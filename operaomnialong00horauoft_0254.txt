HORATII FLACCI

INTERMISSA‚ Venus, diu
Rursus bella moves? Parce, precor, precor.

Non sum qualis eram bonae
Sub regno Cinarae. Desine, dulcium

Mater saeva Cupidinum,

Circa lustra decem flectere mollibus
J am durum imperiis: abi
Quo blandae juvenum te revocant preces. .

Tempestivius in domum

Paulli purpureis ales oloribus 10

Comissabcre Maximi,

Si torrere jecur quaeris idoneum:
Namque et nobilis et decens
Et pro sollicitis non tacitus reis

Et centum puer artium

Late signa feret militiae tuae,

. 2. Rursus bella moves] The Scholiast
Acron says this ode is an allegorical address
to Venus praying her not to compel him to
write any more love poetry, which notion is
generally adopted. I think it is a mistake.

3. Non sum qualis eram] Epp. i. 1. 4.
He here calls Cinara good, because she is
dead 3 elsewhere he calls her ‘ rapax' (Epp.
i. 14. 33). It seems likely that this name
represents a real person, whether she ap-
pears under another name elsewhere or not,
and that Horace had an affection for her.
In the thirteenth ode of this book (v. 22)
her death is mentioned with feeling, aud
there is a reality in the references to her
in all the places where she is alluded to,
which cannot be connected with fiction.
She was associated in all probability with
Horace’s early days.

5. Mater saeva Cupidinum] Repeated
from O. i. 19. 1. Horace here does not copy
himself Ι believe, but some Greek original.
‘ Flectere' is a metaphor taken from the
breaking in of a horse.

9. in domum] So Livy (xl. 7), “ Quin
comissatum ad fratrem imus ?” Here
‘ comissabere’ is equivalent to ‘ comissatum
ibis: and therefore the reading ‘in domum'
is correct. But ‘in domo' has the autho-
rity of the two oldest Berne and other MSS„
and is the reading of Lambinus 81111 most of
the older editors. [Ritter has ‘in domo.']
‘ In domum‚' however, is less likely to have
been invented than ‘in domo,’ and in the
whole of the passage the idea of motion is
contained, as in ‘ abi,' ‘ ales,' ‘ quaeris?

‘ Purpureis’ (which Acron rightly inter-
prets ‘ nitidis, ulchris’) savours of the
Greek, and κωμ σδω ποτὶ τὰν Ἀμαρύλλιδα
(Τ11808. iii. 1) shows that Horace has here
adopted a Greek idiom. Κῶμῳ χρέεσθαι ἐς
ἀλλήλους occurs in Herodotus (i. 21). The
Paullus Maximus here mentioned is called
by the Scholiasts “ nobilis et disertus ado·
lescens et voluptuosus‚” which is plainly a
mere notion of their own derived from the
ode itself‚ and shows that they at least
knew nothing about him. Paullus Fabius
Maximus was a favourite with Augustus,
and consul ΛΑΜ). 743. If therefore he 118
the person meant, he is called ‘ a boy ’ in

joke‚ though it does not follow that he was

of the full consular age in 743: that rule
fell into disuse after the civil wars‚ and was
never strictly observed again. But he had
a son who was a great friend of Ovid’s, and
who was about twenty at this time, and
some editors (Torrentius, J ani, Orelli, and
others) think he is the youth Horace
alludes to (ovid, ex' Ponto, i. 2. 1). He
could only have been beginning his advo·
cate’s career, if this be the person, which
1 am inclined to doubt. ‘ Torrere jecur’
is like Theocritus’ ὄπτεύμενος ἐξ Ἀφρο-
δίτας (vii. 55).

14. sollicitis non tacitus reis] C. ii. 1.
13, “ Insigne moestis praesidium reis.’'

16. Late siynaferet] This is what the
Scholiasts mean when they say (v. 2 11.)
“ἆλληγορικῶς ad Venerem scribit,” with
which expression J ani need not therefore
quarrel. He mistakes the meaning. The
