EPODON LIBER, 5.

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium
Misit Thyesteas preces:

Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent
Convertere humanam vicem;

Diris agam vos ς dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima.

w‘hy venena' should not stand for‘ vene-

of the sentence ; and, asthe corrections he
s do not please himself, they need
not be repeated here. The Scholiasts throw
no light upon the subject with their expla
nations, and 1 feel very doubtful about the
meaning. The words may be translated as
they stand· “Witchcrast οι· the great
powers of right and wrong cannot change
the fate of men ;’' i. e. nothing can, whether
it be good οι· bad ; and though that inter-
pretation does not satisfy me, 1 prefer it to
the others, because it is the least strained
with reference to the collocation of the
words. The omission of, a copula between
‘’venena and‘ magnum' is no argument
against this version. The only other ex-
planation that coincides at all with the
order of the words is that which makes
“magnum fas nefasque’ an exclamation:
“Witehcraflz, by the mighty laws of hea-
ven! cannot change the destiny of man.’'

· tion of the difficulty ς and, notwithstand-

ing Orelli' s bad opinion of this interpreta-
tiogn,1 think it may take its place among
the more plausible of the many explana-
tions that phave been offered. Orelli has
given every other that has been
in his excursus on the Ritter
translates it thus: ‘Poisonous juices, bo
they good or bad, have no power to keep
off the lot that belongs to man. ¹]
