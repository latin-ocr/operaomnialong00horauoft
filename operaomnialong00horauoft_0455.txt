Trans Tiberim longe cubat is prope Caesaris hortos.”

“Nil habeo quod agam et non sum piger ς usque sequar te.''

Demitto auriculas ut iniquae mentis asellus,
Cum gravius dorso subiit onus.

[21. dorso subiit onae] The last syllable
of ‘subiit' is generally said to be length-
ened by the caesura: but the word may
inve been pronounced ‘subyit.' The sense
is when ‘the ass is come under a load too
hnvy for his back’]

· 22. non Viscum plan‘s micum] In the
next Satire we have (v. 83) “Fuscus et
haec utinam Viscorum laudet uterque ;’'
and at the supper of Nasidienus (S. ii. 8.
20) we bave “Summus ego et prope me

Viscus Thurinus, et infra Si memini Va-
rius.'' On the present passage Acron and
Comm. Cruq. say that Viscus was “diser-
tus illius temporis homo,’' and some said
he was a and a friend of Horace.
Porphyrion has here the name ‘ Fuscum ’
(or, as it appears in Ascensius’ text twice
over, ”hiscum ’)‚ and says he was a dis-
tinguished writer of tragedies. Here he
is associated with Varius, and in the latter
of the above passages a Viscus also appears
in Varius’ company. In the former there
are two Visci and a Fuscus, and Varius
just above. An this creates some doubt as
to the reading here. Aristius Fuscus was
one of Horace’s most intimate friends (C.
i. 22, Introduction), and we meet with him
below (v. 61) in a very humorous charac-
ter. It is perhaps better to suppose one
of the Visci to be meant here, for he
plainly held them both among his best
friends (S. i. 10. 83). As to Varius, see
S. v. 40 n.

23. quis me seribere plures aut eitius]
The ignorant fellow here fastens upon the
very faculty that Horace held in the great-
est contempt. On Hermogenes, see S. i.
3. 129 11. The opportunity for interrupt-
ing the prater which Horace seized upon
is not very apparent. Orelli and others
say because he was determined not to listen
to the praises of Hermogenes, whom he
detested. Horace gets in a word, and,
trying to resign himself to his fate, and to
turn the conversation to topics too un-
meaning to give a handle to the man’s
vanity, he asks him if his father and mo-
ther are alive ε ‘quis te salvo eet opus ’ is
only a formula of civility. Τὶιε man, who
has no feeling for any one but himself, an-
swers with indifference that he has buried
them all, which givos occasion for Horace
to exelaim internally, he wishes he was
dead too. What follows (‘Felices,’ duc.)
I suppose we must understand as a quaint
notion passing through Horace’s own mind,
—one of those pleasantries that sometimes
rise upto mock men in despair. Certainly
we are not to imagine that he is speaking
