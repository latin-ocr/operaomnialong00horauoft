Maecena? table, and which had disagreed with him. He seems to imply that Maecenas
hal phyed off a practica] joke upon him, and the whole Epode is full of humour and
&miliat-Ity. 'I'his leads to the supposition that it was not written very early in their
acquaintance, while from the last two verses it has been justly inferi-ed that it was
written before Maecenas was married to Terentia, or in love with her, since the notion
suggested by Acron (not as his own however), that Terentia is there alluded to, is out
of the question. But, for reasons that will be stated in Epod. xiv.‚ Introduction, it is

intended bride.

8. Canidia] This is one of the few
names of which we may be pretty sure
that it represents a real person. The
Scholiasts on this place, and Sat. i. 8. 24,
say that her real name was Gratidia, and
that she was a Neapolitan seller of per-
fumos. She is mentioned always as a witch;
but I do not know why Buttmann says
Horace describes her every where as a
woman grown old amid her intrigues, and
so derives her fictitious name from ‘Canus’
which observation Estre commends. Franke
also calls her “anilis mulier.'' But this
contradicts the notion. which Buttmann
himself adopts, that she was a “fonner
mistress '’ of Horace’s. He was not moa-e
than twenty-eight or twenty-nine (some
say twenty-six) when he wrote against her
