Sive tu mavis, Erycina ridens,
Quam J ocus circum volat et Cupid03

Sive neglectum genus et nepotes

Respicis, auctor

Heu nimis longo satiate ludo,
Quem juvat clamor galeaeque leves
Acer et Mauri peditis cruentum

Voltus in hostem;

Morte jacent merita. —
Hoc opus, haec pietas, haec prima elementa
(38ΉὶῙοίεοί justa per arma patrem?
(Fast. iii. 699, sqq.) And when Augustus
was 33⁴)st Pontifex Maximus Ovid writes
‘c‘ullgnibns aeternis aeterni numina praesunt
Ortus ab Aen-{tangit cognata sacerdos
Numina ; cognatum Vesta tuere eaput.
Quos uncta fovet ille manu, bene vivitis

Vivite inexstincti flammaque duxque
precor. '

Aeneas was said to have preserved the fire
of Vesta and brought her to Rome. ‘ Car-
mina’ is opposed to‘prece' as a set for-
mula toother prayers. ‘ Carmen ’ has that
afflgoizlnmeuts t ilivlaigaZler ’ῗῖἔιοὶιοῗ
rendi carminis.’' Epp. ii. 1. 138 = “ Carmine
Di superi placantur, carmine Manes.”

31. Nube candentes humeros amiotus]
So Homer describes him, εἱμένος ὤμοιϊν
νεφέλην (11. xv. 308). Virg. (Aen. viii.
⁷20)= “candentis limine Phoebi.” ‘Can-
denti ¹ is the reading of the Scholiasts and
one or two old editions. Fea adopts it,
and supposes the ‘ nubes ’ to be a ‘ nimbus '
or ‘ glory ’ round about his head. Graevius'
notion that “nube candentes humeros
amictus ” has reference to the eclipse
reckoued among the prodigIoe at Caoear's
death is not worthy of him. But the fault
is Bothe’s, who edioed Graevius' notes from
marginal readings in his copy of Gruquius’
edition not intended for publication. [The
Romans have no active participles of the
past tense, and so they use passive par·
ticiples in some cases, where the accusative
receives the action of the verbal notion
contained in the participle. Compare C. i.
1. 21, ‘membra stratus ς’ C. ii. 7. 7, ‘eo-
ronatus capillos 3' Sat. i. 1. 5, ‘fractus
membra.']

33. Sive] See i. 3. 1611. ‘Erycina ridens'
corresponds to φιλομμείδης Ἀφροδίτη.
Ἵμερος and 'epm were the two sons of
Venus. [Venus had a temple on the mouu-

tain Eryx, in the north-west part of Sicily.
eie„ In Q. Caecil. c. 17 ; In Verr. Act. ii.
2. 8.] ‘J ocus ¹ is an invention of Horace's.
The reasons for appealing to Apollo as the
stedfast friend of Troy, and, according to
his flatterers, the father of Augustus (not
because he was Φοῖβος καθάρσιος as
Duentzer says), Venus as the mother of
Aeneas and of the Julian family, and Mars
as the father of Romulus, are sufficiently
obvious. Mercury is selected as the repre·
sentative of Augustus, because he is the
messenger of peace (Ovid, Fast. v. 665) z

‘⁸ Pacis et armorum superis imisque deorum

Arbiter.'’

36. Respicis] Cic. (de Leg. ii. 11) pro-
poses the title ‘ Fortuna raepiciena’ which
he explains by ‘ad opem ferendam,’ for a
temple of Fortune.

ludo] See C. i. 28. 17: “ Dant alios
Furiae torvo spectacula Marti.’'

39. Mauripeditis] As the Affican troops
were chiefly cavalry, and according to some
writers distinguished rather for cowardice
than bravery, Marsi has been substituted
for Mauri by some editors, on the conjec-
ture of Tanaquil Faber and against all the
MSS. But other writers speak more highly
of the Mauritaniam ; and the force of ‘ pe-
ditis‚’ which would have no force at all with
Marsi, here ap ’ω be that the rider has
had his horse killed under him, or has dis-
mounted to attack his enemy hand to hand,
or inconsequenee of a wound. See S. ii. 1.
132 “Aut labentis equo describit vulnera
Parthi.'’ On foot the Roman cavalry routed
the Hernicans (Liv. vii. 8), and Statorius
had no difficulty in forming a very fine
body of infantry out of the Numidiam
soldiers of Syphax (Liv. xxiv. 48). It
has been conjectured that Horace took the
idea from a painting. Bentley has caught
up ‘ Marsi ’ as “ certissima emendatae?
Dacier, the inventor's son-indm, sup·
ports the reading with the assertion that
he had seen it in some of the'oldest edi·
tions. Bentley wishes he had access to
those very rare editions, and is afraid this
is only a dream that has come to the
Frenchman ‘ per portam eburneam?
