464 ι HORATII FLACCI

Atqui voltus erat multa et praeclara minantis,

Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto. ιο
Quorsum pertinuit stipare Platona Menandro, ’
Eupolin, Archilochum, comites educere tantos ⁴?

Invidiam placare paras virtute relicta?

iniquis.'’
9. minantis] So the

Greeks sometimes used ἆπειλεῖνι

‘ Promising.’

αὐτίκα δ’ ἠπείλησεν ἑκηβόλῳ Ἀπόλλωνι
ἆρνῶν πρωτογόνων ῥέξειν κλειτὴν ἑκα-

τόμβην. (11. xxiii. 872.)

And, on the other hand, ‘promittere' is
used in the sense of ‘minari‚’ as Comm.
Cruq. observes, quoting “ Promisi ultorem
et verbis odia aspera movi” (Aen. ii. 96),
to which passage Servius gives the same
sense, but it is doubtful.

10. tepido] Comm. Cruq. writes on this
'that Horace disliked the cold, and in the
winter was glad to retreat to his country-
house, where he could have a good fire.
(Epp. i. 7. 10 sq.) But his residence in
the valley of the Licenza was shcltered,
and probably at some seasons warmer
than Rome. Bentley’s conjecture of
‘lecto’ for ‘tecto‚’ which he could not
refrain from publishing, though he did
not adopt it, lest any one else should think
of it and charge him with having stolen
it, is as bad as his haste was unnecessary.
I know no other Commentator that is
likely to have thought of Horace retiring
to his farm to enjoy the luxury of a warm

11. Quorsum pertinuit stipare Platona
Menandro] On the formation of ‘quor-

- sum,’ that is, ‘quovorsum ’ (which occurs

several times in this Satire) and similar
words, see Key's L. G. 798. From the
connexion it might be supposed that
the comic rival of Aristophanes was here
meant, and 1 am not so sure as Orelli that
the philosopher is intended. What Da-
masippus wants is something in the sati-
rical way, and Horace is supposed to have
come into the country prepared to produce
something worthy of his fame. The books
he would bring with him would be of a
kind suited to his purpose, which the
writings of the comedians and of Archi-
lochus, the bitterest of all satirists, would
be. 1 do not sec what Plato, the philo-

sopher, has to do with Menander, Eupolis,
and Archilochus, or the design for which
Horace is supposed to have carried them
into the country with him. Plato's come-
dies were greatly admired by his contem-
poraries. Their character also in some
instances approximated to that of the New
Comedy. Plato is on this account asso-
ciated with the so-called Middle Oomedy;
and so if we take Menander to represent
the new, and Eupolis the old, we shall have
all the three styles of Greek comedy here
assembled. Orelli states that C. Passow
understands ‘Platona' to mean the writer
of comedies. Dacier did the same. ‘Tan-
tos ' Acron refers to the size of the volumem
Orelli to the greatness of the writers.
Perhaps Horace meant both: διλόγους, as
Baxter would say. [‘Menandro’ is the
ablative. Ritter.] ·

13. virtute relicta] Ι have more than
once remarked that the notion of perse-
verance is involved in the Roman ‘virtus’
(C. S. 59), and it is so here, being opposed
to ‘desidia’ (v. 15). But it means more,
for it implies moral courage and a strong
will, which were in great esteem among
the Romans. Damasippus supposes the
poet to be consulting his ease and his
cowardice at the same time ; and says if
he thinks to silence jealousy b oeasing to
write, he will only find himselfy the obJect
of contempt ; and if he means to be idle
now, he must be content tolose the repu-
tation won iu his better days of energy.
As to ‘ Siren? see Epp. i. 2. 23.

16. Damasrsppe] See Introduction.
Horace prays that heaven will send Dama-
sippus, to reward him for his good advice,
a barber to shave his long heard. He may
be, supposed a> have let his heard grow
long with the affectation peculial· to those
who called themselves philosophers ; and
to be delivered from that folly would be
the best boon that could be bestowed upon
him. (See v. 35, and note on S. i. 3. 133.)
Aulus Gellius (N. A. ix. 2) tells a story,
of which he was an eye-witness, of a man
going to Herodes Atticus, “palliatus et
