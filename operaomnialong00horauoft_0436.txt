HORATII FLACCI

In magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita

Ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos.

80

Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnes

Circ um doctores aderat.

Quid multa?

Pudicam ,

Qui primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni
Non solum facto verum opprobrio quoque turpi ς

Nec timuit sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim

85

Si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor

Mercedes sequerer ς neque ego essem questus: at hoc nunc
Laus illi debetur et a me gratia major.

Nil me poeniteat sanum patris hujus, eoque

Non, ut magna dolo factum negat esse suo pars

79. In magno ut populo] The meaning
of this is variously given. “ As is proper
in a great city like Rome‚'’ Dillenbr. says :
“so far as one could see me in such a busy
crowd‚'' is Orelli's interpretation (2nd ed.)
and Heindorf ’s. Doering is divided be-
tween the two. I am not clear upon the
point, but I incline to Heindorf 's opinion.

On the construction, see Key's L. G.
’ § 1451, note. The reading of the old
editions, and the received reading in
Bentley’s time was ‘ si quis! But the Blan-
dinian and other old MSS. have ‘si qni‚'
which occurs above, v.30. [Th. Schmid.
has unanswerably shown that the ‘servi
sequentes ' did not belong to Horace ; and
the ‘vestem' of course would not be the
dress of Horace: Doederlein, whose note
on v. 79 is ingenious, but perhaps not
true.

86} praeeo-coactor] The ‘praeco' was
a crier either at auctions (one of his duties
being to induce persons to attend and buy
—see A. P. 419, ‘⁴ Ut praeco ad merces
turbam qui cogit emendas ³³), or in courts
of justice, or the public assemblies. There
was a ‘ praeco ² at punishments and execu-
tion's to declare the crime of the offender
(Epod. iv. 12 n.); also town-oriem, who
cried lost property, as with u5‚ and other
kinds of criers. Which class Horace refers
to we cannot tell. N or is it decided what
class of ‘ coactores’ his father belonged to.
There were persons employed by the ‘ pub-
licani ' to collect the revenue, ’ and they
were called ‘coactores.' The person who
collected the money bid at an auction was
also a ‘ coactor‚' and generally persons em-
ployed to collect money bore that title.
It is probable that the ‘coactores’ of the
first cluss made a good deal of money.
Matthew the Apostle was one, and he was
rich. It is generally believed that the

90

elder Horace belonged to the second of
the above classes, and some colonr is given
to this by the association of the word with
‘ praeco? But Suetonius, or the author of
Horace’s life attributed to him, simply
says that he was ‘exactionum coactor.'
Also it is questioned whether he continued
his employment at Rome, or quitted it
whffl he lest. Venusia, or only took to it
at me.

87. at hoe nunc] Nearly all the old
editions have ‘ob hoc,' which has very
little MS. authority, and seems to be a
correction of copyists, who wanted a pre-
position for ‘ hoc‚’ not considering the in-
dependent use of this word, which is the
ablative. Acron had ‘ ad haec’. in his
ἓξὲξ ³331{fignffii'ss'ssaaffllhi'affdss'gpaffl
of ‘ob hoc,’ which was then the received
reading. Rutgersius mentions one MS.
with ‘ ab hoc,' from which he extracta
what, with most of the later editors, 1
conceive to be the true reading, ‘at hoc.’
‘At’ is wanted here, and ‘hoc,' in the
sense of ‘propter hoc‚’ is commonly -used
by Horace. See v. 41, “ Hoc tibi Paullus
et Messalla videris?'' and v. 52, “ Felicem
dicere non hoc me possum.'' It is also
common iu Caesar. ‘ At hoc’ is the read-
ing οἳ Aldus' edition of 1501, Orelli’s St.
Gallen MS„ and two mentioned by Fea in
the Vatican library.

89. Nil me poeniteat sanum] ‘I hope
while Ι have my senses I may never be
ashamed.' Horace uses this mode of ex·
pression elsewhere, as in the last Satira,
v. 44, “Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus
amico.'’ S. ii. 3. 322, “ Quae si quis sanus
fecit sanus facis et tu.”

90. dolo] Forcell. does not notice this
use of ‘dolus.' It is used like ‘frans' in
C. i. 28. 30, ‘.‘ Negligis immeritis noci-
