dye was obtained, abounded on the coasts
of Italy. Those of Baiae were most cele-
brated on thewest coast (S.ii.4.32n.)‚
and those of Tarentum on the east (Epp.
ii. 1. 207). The foreign purples (enume-
rated on C. ii. 16. 36) were most esteemed,
and these were imitated by the Italians.
The juices varied in colour in various
places according to climate and local cir-
cumstances. That part of the fish which
yielded the dy e was extracted (S. ii. 4. 32
n.) and strewed with salt iu the propor-
tiou of 20 ounoes to 100 pounds of fi 11.

a red juice used for colouring. Pliny

in imitation of the real dyc. Hace it
came to be used for deception in general.
Aquinum (Aquino), the birth-place of
Juvenal, was a town of Latium on the Via
