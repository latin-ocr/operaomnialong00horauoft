10.] The Genauni were one of the
southern tribes of Raetia between the
lakes Verbanus (Maggiore) and Larius
(Como). Cramer places the Breuni south
of the Alps in the Val Braunia3 others
place them higher up among the modern
Grisons, between the sources of the Rhine
a'nd the Oenus (Inn). The Grisons oc-
cupy a larger portion of the ancient Raetia
than that which belonged to the Breuni,
a small though a warlike tribe. Pliny
(N. H. iii. c. 20) has preserved an inscrip-
tion from a trophy set up in one of the
Alpine towns on this occasion: ‘¹ IMP.

&c- [The Breuni and the Genaunes are
mentioned in this inscription.] ‘Impla-
cidum ’ is a word not found in any writer
earlier than Horace. It is as likely that
he made as that he found it: either may
be true. Velleius (ii. 95) speaks of “mul-
tas urbium et castellorum oppugnationes '⁹
in the course of this war, and says it was
carried on “majore eum periculo quam
damno Romani exercitus‚” which descrip-
tion corresponds to that of Horace. ‘Plus
vice simplici’ the Scholiasts Porph. and
Comm. Cruq. explain to mean ‘with
greater advantage 011 1115 side than the
enemy’s‚' he being ‘sine clade victor'
(v. 32). The literal version would thus
be, ‘with more than an even exchange,'
i. e. of blood. Some persons, after Lam-
binus, understand it to mean more than
once. Gesner suggests that ‘ vice' may
be equivalent to ‘periculo‚’ but 1 believe
the Scholiasts to be right, though the

20

words are not free from difficulty. As to
the construction ‘plus vice,' see O. i. 13.

imitated from the Greek θαυμαστὸς ὅσοις.

20. Indomita-e prope qualis] Bentley
proposed ‘indomitus' because the harassed
Raetians could not properly be compared
to the untamed waters. One MS. has been
found to support him. The wonder is in
such a case that there are not more. Be-
sides the support given to ‘indomitas’ by
the MSS„ it may be observed that the
fourth verse of the Alcaic stanza. is fre-
quently constructed with a noun and its
adjective in the first and last place, and

answering to this rule or habit. [Ritter
joins ‘indomitas’ with ‘prope‚’ and he
explains ‘ indomitas' by ‘non domabiles.’]
Peerlkamp says that ‘ prope ' weakens the
sentence, and Orelli says there is some
truth in that censure. Horace, whose ear
was familiar with the language of the
Greek tragediam, copied their σχεδόν τι
(a common phrase in comparisons) without
being consciens that it weakened his verse,
if it does so. He repeats the phrase S. ii.
3. 268. The Pleiades rise in the evening
on the sixth before the Ides of October
(Columella, xi. 2), when there is 11 west or
south wind sometimes with rain. Tbey
are therefore said to burst the clouds
(scindere nubes), which poured down rain
upon the earth. Jani and others inter· ,
pret the passage as referring to the rising
of the Pleiades in April, when their ap-
proach dispels the last clouds of winter,
and the south wind blows its last storm.
Gesner (with whom Doering agrees) sup-
poses Horace to mean that Tiberius was
