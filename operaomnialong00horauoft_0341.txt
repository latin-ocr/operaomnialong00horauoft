Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo.

9. fide Cyllenea] Τὶιθ lyre invented by
v Mei-cury, born on Μοιιιιι Cyllene in Ar-
cadia. ‘ Diris‚' not ‘ duris‚' is the reading
oldest editions and nearly all the
MSS. Bentley prefers the latter.

11. Centaurus] Cheiron, the instructor
of Achilles. Orelli has collected a large
number of places iu which this subject is
mentioned. Whether Horace took what
follows from any story or not it is impos-
sible ιο determine, as in the similar episode
of Teucer' ιιι C. i. 7

grandi] Juvenal (vii. 210)⁸ describes
Achilles as a big boy at school, ‘Metuens
virgae jam grandis Achilles Cautabat
patriis in montibus ;'' but ‘grandis’ has
not that meaning here, though some have
su it has.

11³3. frigida] This is an adaptation of
Homer’s description (11. xxii. 151): ἦ δ’

ἑτέρη θέρεΐ προρέει εἰκυῖα χαλάζῃἿί χιόνι
ψυχρῇ. ‘Domus Assaraci‚’ ‘proloe Assa-
raci,’ are common in V‘u-gss. Assaracus was
grant-grandfather of Aeneas. Homer took
a more heroic view of the dimensione of the
river Scamander, which was μέγας ποταμὸς
βαθυδίνης (11. xx. 73). Bentley suggests
proni ' for ‘parvi ;’ others have pr

bricus? smooth—flowing.] ary·

15. subtemine] ‘The woof of the webl
‘Certo subtemine’ means only by an un-
alterable destiny. There is no need of
Bentley's alteration to ‘cm-to, ' nor of
taking ‘certo subtemine’ with‘ Parcae,’ as
if it were the adverb of quality, signifying
the‘ Parcae' whose woof of destiny is un-
alterable. SeeCatull. 64. 328, &c.·“c11r-
rite ducentes subtemina currite fusi.'’

‘Mater caerula’ means Thetis, not the sea,
as Com. Cruq. supposes.

18. alloquiis] If the true reading is
without any conjunction, ‘alloquiis’ would
appear to be m apposition with‘ vino can-
,nemmem 0312& {zaraias

may have followed, aster his custom of
imitatiug the Greeks, the use of παρα-
