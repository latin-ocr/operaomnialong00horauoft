82 HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XXXVII.
Aue. 724.

The occasion that gave risc to this ode, and the time therefore of its composition,
are sufficiently clear. Intelligence of the deaths of M. Antonius and Cleopatra was
brought to Rome by M. Tullius Cicero (M. F.) in the autumn of A.U.c. 724. Horace -
appears to have started with an ode of Alcaeus (20 Bergk) on the death of Myrsilus in
his head. It began,

νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν
πίνην ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.

The historical facts referred to in this ode may be gathered from Plutarch’s life of M.
Antonius, and from Dion Cassius (50. c. 31 &c., 51. c. 5-16).

ARGUMENT.

'Tis time to drink, to smite the earth, and set out a feast for the gods, my friends. ¹
We might not bring down the Caecuban while that mad queen with her foul herd
was threatening Rome with destruction. But her fury is humbled, her fleet in

ι flames, her drunken heart shook with fear when Caesar hunted her from Italy as the
hawk pursues the dove or the hunter the hare, to chain the accur-sed monster 3 who

, feared not the sword nor fied to secret hiding-place, but was bold to see her palace
laid low, and to drink in her veins the poison of asps, her courage kindling as she
resolved to die rather than be dragged in triumph by the conqueror.

NUNC est bibendum, nune pede libero
Pulsanda tellus, nunc Saliaribus
Ornare pulvinar deorum
Tempus crat dapibuS, sodales.
Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum ⁵
Cellis avitis, dum Capitolio

Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et imperio parabat

The Greeks used the imperfect ἐχρῆν in
the same undefined way. Two example·
from Aristophanes will be enough :—

ἒμοὶ μελήσει ταῦτά γ’, ἀλλ’ ἥκειν ἐχρῆν. ’
(Pax, 1041.)

οὐκ ἐχρῆν ζητεῖν τινα
σωτηρίαν νῷν, ἀλλὰ μὴ κλᾴειν ἔτι ,·
