1. Sic] This use of ‘sic’ is not easily
explained. It is usual to explain it as ex-
pressing a wish dependent on the accom-
plishment of a condition. It would thus
be ‘ so may the winds favour you as you
discharge the debt you owe.’ But in order
that the ship should discharge her debt the
winds must be favourable, and to wish her
a favourable wind and pleasant voyage after
she had delivered her freight, while with-
out that condition she could not deliver it
at all, is nonsense. Horace seems to mean
this—-‘ I pray thee, O ship, deliver up thy
trust in safety, and to that end may the
stars and winds prosper thee.’ In Virgil
(Ecl. ix. 30) Lycidas urges Moeris to recite
him some verses, and he says :—

“ Sic tua Cyrneas fugiant examina taxos;
Sic cytis? pastae distendant ubera
vaccae.

Here ‘ sic ’ expresses an earnest and affec-
tionate prayer sor the person addressed‚ fol-
lowed by an entreaty to him3 but it cannot
be called a condition so much as a strong
expression of feeling, and such I presume it
to mean in the present instance, where it
amounts to no more than ‘utinam’ in a
strong form, as ὣς does in Greek 3 the object
of the wish being a means by which a
desired end may be aecomplished. There
are other passages where ‘ sic ' follows the
prayer on which it depends, as C. i. 28.

—“ Ne parce malignus arenae—pnr-
ticulam darez
Sic quodcunque minabitur Eurus—’'
and Tibullus (ii. 5, 121) :
“Adnue ; sic tibi sint intonsi, Phoebe,
capilli.'’
In these places the condition and its con-

· sequence are clearly marked, and an oppo-

{itffifiveigh is implied if the condition be not
u .

‘Potens‚' like its kindred word πότνια,
is used with a genitive after it. Venus

from her supposed origin was imagined to
have power over the sea; hence Horace
calls her ⁴ marina ' (C. iii. 26. 5 ; iv. 11.
15). She had the titles εὖπλοία, λιμένιας,
had temples built for her in harbours, and
is represented on coins with a rudder, shell,
and dolphin. Ovid (Heroid. xvi. 23) makes
Paris say of her 2—-

“ Illa dedit faciles somnos ventosque se-
Inchgdgsfiimimm jus habet orta mari ;'’

and Luci-et. (i. 8) :—

-—“ Tibi rident aequora ponti,
Placatumque nitet diffuso lumine eaelum.”

Castor and Pollux had among other titles
that of ἆρωγόναυται. The appellation
‘ lucida sidera' is conjectured to be derived
from certain meteoric appearances after
storms, which the ancients sup to in-
dicate the presence of Castor and Pollux.
Similar phenomena are still called by the
Italian sailors the fire of St. Elmo‚ a cor-
ruption it is believed from Helena. Com-

Aeolus is steward of the winds in Homer
(Odyss. x. 21), king in Virgil, and father
here. The Iapygian or N.W. wind, so
called from Iapygia in Apulia whence it
blows down the Hadriatic, and the usual
name of which was Favonius, was favourable
for a voyage from Brundusium, where Vir-
gil would embark for Greece. It was called
by the Greeks, ἀργέστηςι Arist. de Mundo,
c.4: ἆργέστης ὅ ἀπὸ τῆς θερμῆς δύσεως ὅν
τινες καλοῦσιν Ὀλυμπίαν οἱ δὲ Ἰάπὺγα.
