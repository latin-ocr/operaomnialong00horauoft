A.U.c. 727.

When Augustus was meditating an expedition against the Britons and another for
the East, Horace commended him to the care of Fortune the preserver, as Pindar com-
mitted the sons of Himera :

Λίσσομαι, ra? Ζηνὸς Ἐλευθερίου,

Ἱμέραν εὐρυσθένε’ ἀμφιπόλει, Σώτειρα Τύχα·

τὶν γὰρ ἐν πόντῳ κυβερνῶνται θοαὶ

νᾶες, ἐν χέρσῳ δὲ λαιψηροὶ πόλεμοι

κάγοραὶ βουλαφόροι. (Olymp. xii.)
Which passage probably Horace had in mind. The last expedition against Britain con-
templated by Augustus was A.U.c. 727 (Dion Cass. 53. 22—25), which was interrupted by
an insurrection of the Salassi, an Alpine people‚ ἐς τὴν Βρεταννίαν ἐπειδὴ μὴ ἠθέλησαν
ὁμολογῆσαι στρατενσείοντα κατέσχον οἱ Σαλάσσιοι. At the same time he was preparing
the force that was to conquer Arabia (C. 29 of this Book). To this year therefore the
composition of this ode may be assigned.

The oldest templcs of the goddess Fortune were at Rome, where we leam from
Plutarch (on the Fortune of the Romans, c. x.)‚ τὰ τῆς Τύχης ἱερὰ πάμπολλα καὶ παλαιὰ
καὶ λαμπρὰ τιμαῖς πάσαις ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἐνίδρυται καὶ καταμέμικται τοῖς ἑπιφανεστά·
τοις μέρεσι καὶ τόποις τῆς πόλεως. The oldest of her temples was dedicated to Fortuna
Virilis by Ancus Martius (Plutarch says). There was another to Fortuna Muliebris,
founded in commemoration of the victory of Coriolanus’ mother over her son 3 and
Servius Tullius founded two on the Capitoline hill to Fortuna Primigenia and Fortuna
Obsequens; on the Palatine hill there were two to Fortuna Privata and Fortuna viscosa.
There was also a Fortuna Virginalis and a Fortuna Bonae Spei, a Fortuna Mascula,
ἄλλαι τε μύριαι Τύχης τιμαὶ καὶ ἐπικλήσεις ὧν τὰς πλείστας Σερούϊος κατέστησεν,
εἰδὼς ὅτι μεγάλη ῥοπὴ, μᾶλλον -δὲ ὅλον, ἡ Τύχη παρὰ πάντα ἐστὶ τὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων
πράγματα. But the worship of this goddess was most solemnly maintained, when
Horace wrote, at Praeneste and at Antium (now Porto d’Anzo), where she had anm-acle.
The Roman conception of this divinity was probably different from that of the Greeks,
who thought of her chiefly as a capricious goddess and blind. But that suchwas not
the only idea of her even among the Greeks is plain from Pindar’s ode above quoted.
Pindar in other poems now lost described her as φερέπολις, the supportet of states ; also
as one of the Μοῖραι, and the most powerful of them 3 but elsewhere as ἀπευθὴς, uncer-
tain, unknown 3 in which character casual altars were erected to her by the Greeks as
ἄγνωστος θεός. See St. Paul’s addi-ess to the Atheniens in Acts xvii. 235 also Pausa-
nias, iv. 30, vii. 26; aud Plutarch’s Trcatise above mentioned, caps· 4 and 10. From
Plutarch’s account she would appear to be the one divinity held from the earliest times
