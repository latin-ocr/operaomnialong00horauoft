206 HORATII FLACCI

Here thou mayest hang by thy gii-dle, or dash thee on the rocks, or into the stormy
waveS, unless thou wouldest yield thyself a barbarian’s slave.'’—Then came Venusand Ι
her son, and laughed mischievously‚ and said, ‘⁴ Cease thy wrath when *the monster
shall come back to give thee thy revenge. What, knowest thou not that thou art the
sponse of Jove? Away with sighs. Bear thy noble destiny‚ for one half the world
shall take its name from thee.”

IMPIOS parrae recinentis omen
Ducat et praegnans canis aut ab agro
Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino
Fetaque vulpes : ’
Rumpat et serpens iter institutum 5
Si per obliquum similis sagittae
Terruit mannos ε ego cui timebo
. Providus auspex,
Antequam stantes repetat paludes
Imbrium divina avis imminentum,
Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo
Solis ab ortu:
Sis licet felix ubicunque mavis,
Et memor nostri, Galatea, vivas,
Teque nec laevus vetet ire picus
Nec vaga cornix.

ance of the eyeS. Horace applies it to a
wolf or a lion (Epod. xvi. 33), in the latter
case imitating perhaps Homcr’s χαροποὶ
λέοντες (Odyss. xi. 611). But what does
Homer mean Ρ Etymology does not help
us, for χαροπὸς, except in a derived sense,
can only mean glad-eyed‚ and there is
nothing in the colour of a wolf or a lion
corresponding to that notion. The wolf is
represented as running down from the hills
‚ of Lanuvium, because that town was near
the Appia Via leading to Brundusium,
where Galatea would embark. ‘ Rumpat,’
not ‘ rumpit‚' as Bentley reads, is Ibelieve
the reading which the sense requires.
Bentley appears to have mistaken the mean·
ing of the passage. [Keller has ‘ rumpit.']
The image of the snake shooting across
the road recalls Jacob's prophecy in re-
spect to his son Dan: “Dan shall be a
serpent by the way 3 an adder in the path
that biteth the horse's heels, so that his
rider shall fall backwards” (Gen. xlix. 17).

raven with my prayers 1 wiU call up from
the East: which would be an omen of good
weather, and the crow flying to the marsh
of bad. Lucretius speaks of these birds as
those which
“ — aquam dicuntur et
imbris
Poscere et interdum ventos aurasque
vocare.'' (v. 1084.)

‘ Oscines aves' were birds whose omens
were taken from their note, as ‘praepetes’
from their ssight.

13. Sis licetfelix] There is a tender-
ness spart from familiarity in these two
stanzas which gives much reality to the ode:
but to speak of it as addressed to “one of
his mistresses ” destroys that reality at
once. [Ritter does the work completely ε
‘ Galatea hoc uno loco memorata est. Per
occasionem neque longius eam amasse vi-
detur.’] There is nothing of passion in this
or any other part of the ode, such as we
