At tu conclusas hircinis follibus aurae,

21. Beatus Famae] This Fannius is
spoken ofin another place (S. i. 10. 80) as
a contamptible ιι and a parasite of
ermogenes Tigellius (S. 3.129 n.). The
Scholiasts say that he had the cognomen
Quat-tm· ythat hewasapoetfullof
words and solly · that the Senate made
hina t of some ‘psaeca ³(book·boxes)
und a bust of himself ς that when he was
dying he desired his books and book-cases
to beburnt publicly ς otherwise, that he
was a writer of Satire, and childless, and
that certain persons, hoping to be remem-
bered in his will, got his busts and his
books deposited in the public librarios, to
which honour his own merits did not en·
title them. Wherever all this came from,
it is of no valae for determining Horace’s

· '- . mining. Lambinus ronow-stne Scholiasts

so fau· as to suppose that Fannius was ho-
noured by a spontaneous present (⁶ ultroz'
aesc. iv. 4. 5ln.) on the part ofthe
- us sive senatus” of a set of book-
imas and a bust, as a mark of “public re-
spect. And Turnebus says, “Fannium
mado quem poetam cujus libros Romani
ot armario et capsa, ipsum imagine dona-
rant, prae sefelicem praedicat? But who
γ ever heard ofsuch a pthing Ρ tintl who was
” this Fannius that he should have been
thm distinguished P It. ap ppears probable,
from Horace' s words, that Fannius had his

’¹ - admirers, as rant and emptiness will always

have, and that they made him a present,
by way of a testimonial as it is called, of a
set ofhandsome‘ capsae ’and a bnst. The
‘capsa ’ was a round box suited to hold one
οι· more rolled volumes. The large-1· sort
was called ‘scrinium.’ (See Smith’s Dict.
Ant.) Neither‘ capsae’ nor ‘scrinia’ must
be eonfounded with‘ armaria,’ which were

not boxes, but also used for
books. though not oonflned to that purpose
any more than‘ capsae' were. What the

Quemvis media erue turba:

Scholiasta say about Fannius' bust having
been placed in the various public libr-aries
is not inconsistent with usage. Asinius
Pollio built a library sanc. 715, οι· there-
abouts, and placed in it porti-aits and busts
of various distinguished meu (Plin. H. N.
vii. c. 30). aud the practice was thcncefor·
ward observed not only in the public libra·
ries, but in those of private persons. Mar-
tial, writing to his friend Avitus, sends
him an inscription sor his own bust, which
Avitus was going to put with others iu
his library: —

“Hoc tibi sub nostra breve carmen imagine
Quzviiiiatnon obscuris jungis,
viris.” (ix. 1.)

Avite,

23. volgo recitare timentis] See note
ou v. 73. The usage which leaves the
personal pronoun to bc inferred from the

ve is common both ιιι Greek and
ὲοῦἰιι. (C. iii. 22. 6.) Compare Arist.
lut. 32 :—

τὸν ἐμὸν μὲν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ταλαιπώρου σχεδὸν
ἤδη νομίζων ἐκτετοξεῦσθαι βίον,

and ovid (Heroid. v. 45) ι “ Et flesti, et
nostros vidisti flentis ooeuosss’ ‘ Timeo’
and ‘ metuo ' do not govern an infinitive
mood in the prose writings of Homce's
day. ‘ Vereor’ is used in that construction.
Torrentius asks why Horace’s works should
not be read because he was afraid to recite
them in public ? Was it because the multi-
tude follow popular applause which is drawn
forth by public display P The reason Ho-
race gives is the same that deters him from
reciting his poems, that no one likoe to see
any more than to hear his own vices ex·
posed. People arc not at all fond of ‘ genus
hoc,' this satirical sort of writing, because
most are open to blame. He has particular
classes, or persons perhaps, in his eye, when
he says ‘sunt quos’ (C. i. 1. 3 n.); but he
speaks otherwise generally. That Horace
wrote many pieccs which have not been
preserved, appears to me clear from this
who adopts ‘ erue,’ does not give the MS.
