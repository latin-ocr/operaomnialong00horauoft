420 HORATII FLACCI

Aut citius possit versus ¹? quis membra movere

Mollius‘? Invideat quod et Hermogenes ego canto.” 25
Interpellandi locus hic erat : “ Est tibi mater, ’ ’
Cognati, quis te salvo est opus? '’—“ Haud mihi quisquam.
Omnes composui.”—-Felices ! nunc ego resto.

Confice ς namque instat fatum mihi triste Sabella

Quod puero cecinit divina mota anus urna : 30
Hunc neque dira venena nec hosticus auferet ensis

Nec laterum dolor aut tussis nec tarda podagra;

Garrulus hunc quando consumet cunque 3 loquaces

Si sapiat vitet simul atque adoleverit aetas.

Ventum erat ad Vestae, quarta jam parte diei ⁷ 35
Praeterita, et casu tunc respondere vadato

to his persecutor, for his behaviour and
the absence of any reply show that he

, 13 not.

[25. Invideat quod—canto] ‘And my
singing might make Hermogenes envy?
‘ quod canto ' is like Sallust's ‘ quae homi-
, nes arant,’ Cat. 2:] see 0. 111. 16. 26 11.

29. Govfice; namque instat] ‘Confice‚’
despatch me, finish me. It is a technical
word for the transaction and completion
of business. As to the Sabine witehes, see
Epod. xvii. 28 ς and on ‘ urna,' see 0. ii. 3.
25 n. As Fate, so the witch shakes her
111-11, and the lot or name of this or that
person falls out, on which she pronounces
her prophecies. The Scholiasts Acron and
Comm. Cruq. take ‘ mota ³ as the nomina—
tive case, in the sense of ‘commota‚’ agi-
tated. I believe all the three words-—
‘ divina‚’ ‘ mota,’ and ‘ urna ’—to be in the
ablative, though Bentley says that this
reading is “ita scabrum atque horridum
111 110 proletario quidem vati, nedum Hora-
tio dignum sit.” He himself agrees with
Cruquius‚ and transposing ‘divina’ and
‘mota‚’ makes the former agree with
‘anus' ‘Quandocunque’ has sometimes,
but rarely, the sense of ‘aliquando‚' ‘some-
time or other! Bentley quotes two in-
3100003 from Ovid. [‘ Divina,' ‘the pro-
phetie um! Ritter compares ‘divina
avis,’ 0. 111. 27. 10.]

35. Ventum erat ad Vestae] Three
hours were now passed since sunrise
(quarta jam parte ’), and having walked
through the Forum they were approach-
ing the Tiber, not far from which, and to
the west of Mons Palatinus, stood the
temple of Vesta, with 1110 Atrium Numae
and Lucus Vestae attached (0. 1. 2. 16 n.).
It is generally stated that the temple of

Vesta was close to the ‘puteal Libonis ’
(S. ii. 6. 35 n.)‚ where the praetor held his
court. But that appears to have been in
the Forum, and this temple was not.
Nar-dini places in its immediate neigh-
bourhood the Basilica J ulia, where the
centumviri held their courts, in which also
the praetor presided. Martial thus alludes
to them (vi. 38) :—

“ J am clamor centumque viri densumque
coronae .

Vulgus et infanti Julia tecta placent.''

If this be so, we may suppose that it was
here the man had to make his appearance,
or forfeit his ‘vadimonium.' It was now
past the hour when the business of 1110
com-ts commenced, as Μαι-11111 says (iv. 8.
2), “ Exercet raucos tertia causidicos?
36. casu tune respondere vadato] This

passage has been fully explained by Mn· ,
Long in his note 011 Cic. Verr. 11. 3. 15 :—

“The expression ‘vadari aliquem’ means
to require ‘vades‚’ ‘sureties,’ of a party.
The corresponding term 13 ‘ vadimonium
promittere‚' which is said of him who gives
‘vades’ Bentley's correction of ‘vadatus'
for ‘vadato’ is against all the MSS. and
the general usage of the word, though ‘va-
datus ' is sometimes used passively, as he
shows.” The same may be said of the
participles of other deponent verbs (0. 1. 1.
24 n.) of which the passive sense however
must be clearly made out before it can be
admitted. The ‘ vadatus' therefore was
the plaintiff in an action, in which the hero
of this satire was defendant. He had en-
tered into an engagement (⁸ vadimonium ')
to appear on a certain day 10 answer to the
action, and if he failed he would lose hia
cause, and forfeit the amount of his ‘vadi-
