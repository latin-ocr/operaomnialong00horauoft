Et longorum operum finis: ne forte pudori

Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo.
Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte

Nec rude quid possit video ingenium ; alterius sic

aya of Solon’a lawa: κατ συ εἷς
ξυλίνους ἄξονας ἐν πλαισίοις περιέχωσι

στρεφομένους· καὶ προσηγορεύθησαν ὥς
Ἀριστοτέλης φησὶ κύρβεις (Solon, c. 25).
ta of these lawa, inscribed on
wooden tamea, called ἄξονες or κνρβει ι,ς
existedinhiaday in the neum.
400. divim vatibus] Eumolpus, Or·
pheua, Musaeus, Pamphua, Thamyris, are
the names associated with the

of Grecian poetry, and they are all
calledThracian (v. 405 n.). They arecalled

‘diving' not merely from the yquality of ῆι), a country

their art, but from their connexion with
the worship of A pollo, Demeter, and Dio-
nyma, whence (v. 391) Orpheus ia called
‘⁸ noer interpresque deorum.”

402. mares animos] Tyr-
nm (v. 75 n.) was a native of Attica, and
wrote in the elegiae measure. He took up
hia :bodo at Sparta during the second war
between the Spartana and Messeniam,
which began Β. c. 685. “Exhortation to
lnavery was the theme which the poet t'ook
fill· many elegies (called noo-iiten δι’ ελε-
ydus, i.e. lemma and exhortatione in
elegiae verae), and wrote on it with nuceas-
ing spirit and ever new invention. Never
was the duty and the honour of bravery

on the youth of a nation with so
much heauty and forceof language, by such
natural and touching motivoe” (Mulier,
p. 112). There are three fragmenta, which
have much vigour and feeling (7-9 Bergk).
⁴ [403. sortes] ‘Oraclea’ v. 219. ‘Vitae.
via ε’ show-n by such writers as Ηεεὶοᾱ,
Theognis, and Solon. ‘Gratia regum. ·’ kinga
were the patmus of Pindar and others]

405. Pieriis tentata modis] The coun-
try of Pieria lay between Macedonia and
Themin, north of the range of Olympus,
and on the coast of the Sinna Thermaicus.
'niis accounts for the Muses being both

Pierian and Oly mp ian. Mfiller (p. 27) saya
that the Pieriana li'ved up to the time of the
Doric and Aeolio migrations' ιιι Boeotia and
Phocis, near the mountain tanges of Heli·
con in the former and Parnassus in the
latter. ‘Vhence he supposes that to the
Pierians is to be traced the orig-iu of
Greek poetry, and that to this is to be at-
tributed the association of the Muses with
Helicon and Parnassus. He thus also ac-
counts sor the traditious which assigned the
birth ofpoet ry to barda of Thrace (v. 400
of which the was
pronounced barbarous by the civilized
Greeks· for “ when the Pierians were
proesed in their own territory by the early
Macedonian princes, some of them emesed
the Strymon into Thrace proper ” (Hermi.
vii. 112). “It is however quite conceivable
(Muller adds, and perhaps he had better
have been content with this) that in early
timae, on account of their close vicinity‚ or
because all the north was comprehended
under one name, the Pierians might in
Southern Greece have been called Thrac-
ians. Thoee Pierians, from the intellectual
relations which they maintained with the
Greeks, appear to be a Grecian race ; which
suppositiou ia also continued by the Greek
namoe of their places, rivers, fountainS, &c.”
Further obsen ations will be found in the
same work showing the probable connexion
between these Pierians and the Epic poeti-y
of Homer.

406. Et lonqorum operum fi' m] The
rural Dionysia (v. 275 n. ), called τὰ κατ’
ἄγροῦς οι· τὰ au ικρά, took place at the end of
the year, in the mouth Ποσει δέον, whenthe
labours of the vintage were over.
