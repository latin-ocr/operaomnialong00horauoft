(S. ii. 2. 124; and 6. 8), and others else-
where. There can be little doubt I
think that this Scholiast’s reading is
correct, though the respectable names of
Doering and Gesner, as well as most of the
older editors (Lambinus among them), and
the Scholiasts Acron and Porphyrion, are on
the other side. Iu the fifty-third line there
is a curious specimen of Bentley's per-
verseneSS, if it be not an oversight. He
acknowledges that ‘ manus potentes ' is the
universal reading, and says that he has no
fault to find with it, though, if he could
get a single MS. of any antiquity to sup·
port him, he would read ‘manum poten-
tem‚' and apply it to Augustus. After
this we should expect to find him following
in the same track as his predecessors. But
not so. He edits ‘manum potentem?

51. bellante prior] The chorus pray
rather for the blessings of peace than the
triumphs of war, and therefore say that
Augustus's clemency to his conquered ene-
mies makes him greater than his prowess
in subduing them, according to Anehises’
warning (Aen. vi. 851), in which virgil
refers to Augustus z—

“Tu regere imperio populos, Romane,
memento 3
Hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere
morem,
Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.”

54. Albanas—secures] The Roman
fasces, as “ Albanique patres ” (Aen. i. 7).

55. responsa] Replies to their offers of
submission and petitions for friendship.
This word is used for the replies of the
gods, and here perhaps expresses the ma-
jesty of Augustus delivering his will as
that of a god, like Virgil (Ecl. i. 45)z
‘⁸ Hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille
petenti? But ‘responsum' also signifies
the answer of a jurisconsult to a client, or
a superior to an inferior, as of the emperor
to the governor of a province.

57. Jam Fides et Pace] This group
occurs nearly in the same combination in
C. i. 24. 6. The figures are variously re·
presented on medan, ἔω. ‘ Fides: which
represents honesty, good faith, and is called
in the above place ‘justitiae soror,' appears
on a medal of Vespa-sian as a matron with
long robe, very erect figure, holding out a
⁶ patera ’ in her right hand, and carrying a
‘ cornu copiae ’ iu the other. ‘ Pax ’ usually
carries a caduceus and olive-branch in one
hand, and sometimes corn in the other.
‘ Honos‚’ which has nothing to do with
what we call honour in the sense of honesty
(‘ fides ’)‚ but represents Gloria in her
character (for she had a bad, as vain glory‚
C. i. 18. 15), is exhibited 011 the reverse of
a medai of Titus as a man advaneed in
years, with one foot upon a globe, with a
cornu copiae in one hand, and the other
leaning upon a spear. On another metm
he is side by side with Virtus, whose natural
companion he is. For Virtus is most usu-
ally represented in a military character as
Fortitudo, a female figure with a helmet
and a spear, and with her foot like that ·of
Honos testing on a globe. But though
these types symbolically represented Vir-
tus, the name embraced all moral courage
and steadfastuess in well-doing, with which
military courage was closely associated in
the mind of a Roman. ‘ Pudor ³ or ‘ pudi-
citia ’ represents conjugal fidelity, and is
exhibited (on a medal of Herennia Etrus-
cilla in the collection at Florence) as a
modest matron, seated, and drawing her
veil half over her faee. Juvenal speaks of
her as having left the earth at ,the close of
the reign of Saturn, or, as he sarcastically
puts it, when Jove began to wear a heard
(vi. 16). But these virtues are said to have
left the earth with Astraea at the close of
the golden age, and their return represents
the return of that age.

60. Copia cornu] Copia, whose horn
was most properly the symbol of Fortune
