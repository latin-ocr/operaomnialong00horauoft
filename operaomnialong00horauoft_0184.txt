148 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT. ”

Come down, Calliope, and sing a losty strain. Is it a dream, or am 1 wandering in the
Muses’ grove? I was a child, and tired with play Ι lay down to sleep on the Apulian
hills. There doves made me a covering of leaves, and Ι slept safe, and men might
well wonder how the gods were present with me. Yours am Ι, ye Muses, on the
Sabine hills, at Tibur, at Praeneste, or at Baiae. Because 1 love your fountains and
your choir I perished not when the battle was turned, nor by the accursed tree, nor
in the Sicilian waters. Be ye with me and I will visit the mad Bosporus, the sands
of the East, the savage Briton, the Concan, the Geloni, and the Tanais, unharmed.

’ Ye refresh Augustus when be brings back his weary troops from the war. Mild are
your counsels, and in peace is your delight. We know how that bold giant band
struck terror into the beart of Jove 3 but what was their strength against the aegis
of Pallas? 'Twas that which drove them back, though Vulcan too, and June, and

Apollo with his bow, were there. Brute force faus sels-destroyed: the gods detest ’·
violence, but tempered strength they promote: let Gyas be my witness, Orion the ⁸

seducor, Earth mourning for her sons, Aetna with ever-burning and uneonsuming
flame, the vulture of Tityus, and the chains of Peirithous.

DESCENDE caelo et dic age tibia
Regina longum Calliope melos,
Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus cithara-que Phoebi.
Auditis, an me ludit amabilis 5
Insania ’.Ρ Audire et videor pios
Errare per lucos amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.
Me fabulosae Vulture in Apulo
Altrieis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes

2. longum] This seems to mean a sus-
tained and stately song. There is a little
likeness between this opening and a frag-
ment of Alcman (29 Bergk) 2-

4. citharaque] Τὴθ balance of authority
is in favour of ‘ve,’ but the sense is against
it. There is no opposition between ‘ci-
thara’ and ‘fidibus' They mean the same
thing. Bentley, as usual, prefers ‘ve‚'
[and Keller and Ritter,] which got into
the MSS. probably from a careless refer-
ence to ‘ seu.¹

9. fabulosae] The Scholiasta take this
with ‘altricia’ but it clearly belongs to
‘ palumbes' the ¹ storied doves‚’ as ‘ fabu-
losus Hydaspes' (C. i. 22. 8). The range

of the Apennines that bore the name ‘Vul-
tur,’ was partly in Apulia and partly in
Lucania. It is still called Monte Volture.
Venusia, Horace's birth-plaee, was near the
boundary of those provinces, whence he
calls Apulia his nurse, though elsewhere
(S. ii. 1. 34) he says it is doubtful whether
he was an Apulian or a Lueanian. Bentley
proposes to read ‘ nutricis extra limina
sedulae‚' taking ‘nutricis’ literally, for
which word he has authority ς but ‘sedu-
lae' is his own invention. [As the first
syllable in ‘Apulus‚' and ‘Apulia' are sup-
posed to be always long, and the second
short, there are two faults in ‘Apuliae.’
The exception ‘Apulia,' S. i. 5. 77, is ex·
plained, says Ritter, by the ‘u ’ being ‘ in
arsi, natura litterae liquidae adiutus ς’ but
the length of the ‘u’ might be explained
in the same way here. However, there
