HORATII FLACOI

v⁷0

Effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus.

Cum rapies injus malis ridentem alienis,

Fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum et cum volet arbor.
Si male rem gerere insani est, contra bene sani,

Putidius multo cerebrum est, mihi crede, Perilli

Dictantis quod tu nunquam rescribere possis.
Audire atque togam jubeo componere, quisquis
Ambitione mala aut argenti pallet amore,
Quisquis luxuria tristive superstitione

Aut alio mentis morbo calet ς huc propius me,

referre alicui ς’ sometimes, but rarely, ‘ abs
aliquo,’ not ‘a.’ (See Cicero, Orat. c. 47,
and other authorities quoted by Mr. Long
on Caesar, B. G. viii. 38.)

The Scholiast on Persius (l. c.) says that
the Nerius there mentioned made a great
deal of money through the death of his
wives ‘and was a notorious usurer, being
the same that Horace alludes to.’ Iput
no faith in this. The name in either case
' stands for any body that the case may
suit, though it may have become pro-
verbial through some person that bore it.
‘ Cicuta' is a nickname, the Scholiasts
say, given to some notorious usurer for
his sour temper. Horace represents him
as a shrewd person to have dealings with3
one who when he advanced money looked
well to the seeurity, and when he bound
a debtor tied the knot tight. [See note
at the end of the volume]

71. Proteus] For the story of Pro-
teus, see Hom. Odyss. iv. 410, sqq„ 455
sqq. :—
0:36³ ὖ γέρων δολίης ἐπελήθετο τέχνης
ἀλλ’ ἤτοι πρώτιστα λέων γένετ’ ἠϋγένειος,
αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δράκων, καὶ πάρδαλις, ἡδὲ

μέγας σῦς·
γίγνετο δ’ ὑγρὸν ὕδωρ, καὶ δένδρεον ὑψι-
πέτηλον.

(whieh Virgil has imitated, Georg. iv.
ἓὲῗέἓᾳ.) Ovid, Fast. i. 369 3 A. A. i.

“ thue leves Proteus modo se tenuabit
in undas 3
Nunc leo, nunc arbor, nunc erit hirtus

aper.”

As to ‘rapies in jus,' see note on S. i. 9.
77. ‘Malis ridentem alienis' is a pro-
verbial way of expressing a hypocrite who
puts on a face not his own. The words
are taken, without strict regard to their

80

application, from‘ the Odyssey (xx. 347),
οἱ δ’ ἤδη γναθμοῖσι γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισι,
where the suitors of Penelope laugh when
they would rather have cried‚ like “Quin
et Ixion Tityosque vultu Risit invito ''
(C. iii. 11. 21). The sense is, that this
cunning debtor, when his creditor sues
him, will put on all kinds of characters,
tell all manner of lies, get out of the
obligation, and laugh at his creditor, let
him do what he will to bind him. 'rho
reading ‘in jura,’ which appears in a
great many MSS„ and in most of the old
editions, has no meaning. It arose from a
misunderstanding of ‘malis alienis‚’ which
was supposed to mean another person’s
misfortunes. Compare Valerius Flac. (Ar-
gon. viii. 163), “ Errantesque genae atque.
alieno gaudia vultu Semper erant.''

74. Si male rem gerere] See v. 40 n.

75. putidius] Foreellini explains, 1 be-
lieve correctly, “insanius et quasi cor-
ruptius.'’ Perillius is supposed to be the
‘ Cicuta’ mentioned above, v. 69, but see
note. As ‘ scribere’ signifies to make an
entry, ‘rescribere' signifies to make an-
other entry which destroys the effect of
the first. ‘ Quod tu nunquam rescribere
possis' therefore means ‘what you ean
ξιξ-1181218113ὀῦΙὶἕιὶξὲῗῖοτιίὴξοδῗξιὲξίἒιξ

write out or the sum to be entered either γ

111 the books of the borrower or of his
agent, the banker; and either way 18
equivalent to lending money.

77. togam jubeo componere] This only
means to sit down aud composedly attend
to what he is going to say. He turns
from Damasippus to an imaginary mixed

audience.
78. pallet] Persius (S. iv. 47) uses this

word probably in imitation of Horace,
‘⁶ Viso si palles, improbe, nummo.'' »
