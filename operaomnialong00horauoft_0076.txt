HORATH FLACCI .

Nuper sollicitum quae mihi taedium,
Nunc desiderium curaque non levis,

Interfusa nitentes

Vites aequora Cycladas.

‘ nisi debes ’ as if it were ‘ ne debeas,’ and
‘ debes ludibrium ’ for the Greek ὀφλι-
σκάνεις γέλωτα. Ι do not see how ‘nisi
debes ’ can stand for ‘ ne debeas,' and agree
rather with Dillenbr. [‘eave’ means ‘take
care of yourselfi’]

17. Nuper sollicitum] This is the most
obscure part of the ode. It would be very
intelligible as spoken by Alcaeus, whohaving
gone through the long and anxious struggle
between the democratical party and the
nobles, aud seen the triumph of the former,
and the settlement of a tyranny which he
abhorred in his native city, may be sup-
posed to have felt for her the anxious affec-
tion these words imply. Horace may have

found something of this sort in Alcaeus’
ode. How the words are reconciled with
Buttmann's theory will be seen in the In-
troduction. Taking the ode as an address
to the state, we can only understand Horace
to mean, that while he was attached to
Brutus, or before he had secured his pardon,
he had no other feelings than fear for his
own safety and disgust with the state of
the country, but now under Augustus he
watches its fate with the affection and
anxiety of a friend.

19. nitentes] This is like ‘fulgentes'
(C. iii. 28. 14), shining in the sun. The
Cyclades abounded in white marble.

OARMEN XV.

This is probably an early composition of Horace, made up of materials from the Greek,
and written merely to exercise his pen. The Scholiasts found a political allusion in the
ode: Paris being M. Antonius, aud Helen Cleopatr-215 and Baxter, ὁ διλογίστης, has seized
upon the notiou‚ which others also have adopted. The judicious reader will see that
there is no probability of such being the drift of the* ode. Nereus is made to speak be-
cause the sea-gods were endowed with the gift of prophecy. Porphyrion on this ode says
it is an imitation of Bacchylides, who makes Cassandra foretell the destruction of Troy
as Horace does Nereus. There is a fragment (29 Bergk) which is supposed to belong
to the poem referred to by this Scholiasta, but it bears no resemblance to Horace's ode.

ARGUMENT.

Paris is carrying off Helen, when Nereus causes a calm aud thus prophesies their fate.
With dark omen art thou carrying home her whom Greece hath sworn to recover.
Aias! for the sweating of horse aud rider, and the deaths thou art bringing upon
Troy. Panas prepareth her arms and her fury. Under Venus' shelter comb thy
locks and strike thy lyre, and hide thyself in thy chamber: but it shall not avail
thee. Seest thou not Laertes’ son, Nestor of Pylos, Teucer of Salamis, and Sthenelus
the fighter and bold charioteer? Merion too aud the son ,of Tydeus, from whom
thou shalt fiee panting as the stag fleeth from the wolf, thou who didst boast better
things to thy fair oue. Achilles' wrath may put off the evil day, but the fire of the

Greek shall consume the homes of Troy.

PASTOR cum traheret per freta navibus
Idaeis Helenen perfidus hospitam,

2. Helenen] Horace uses the Greek
inflexions in his odes, and the Latin iu his
iambicverses‚ satires, and epistles (Bentley).

This might be expected, especially when,
as in this instance, the imitation of Greek
writers is obvious.
