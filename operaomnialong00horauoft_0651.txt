EPISTOLARUM Ι. 14. 615

What you calla desert 1 call a beautiful laudscape, and what you think beautiful 1
dielike. Yon long for the brothel and greasy tavei-n. and dancing to a wanton's
music, declaring that my palti-y place would as soon bear pepper as the grape; and
yet with all this dulness you must work forsooth at the hardoet of soils, and look
aiter the oren, aud attend ω the river banks, and so forth. Yon know the gay man
1 ως now I like nothing but simple fare in a plain country way, and though Ι
love my recreation 1 should be ashamed to be always at play. No em· y pursuoe mc
into the country, though my neighbours good-humouredly quiz mc in my new
character of farmer. But you had rather go back to your city rations, while the
stable boy is envying you your logs and your flocks nnd your gui-den, just as the ox
longa for the saddle, and the horse for the plough. 1 advise each to mind the
business he understands.
