Hac ego si compellor imagine cuncta resigno;

Otia divitiis Arabum liberrima muto.

Saepe verecundum laudasti, rexque paterque
Audisti coram, 1100 verbo parcius absens:

Haud male Telemachus, proles patientis Ulixei :

Strenuus et fortis causisque Philippus agendis

³4. Hae eqo n· compellor] Aa to ‘com-
pellor,’ see S. ii. 8. 297, [and ‘ resigno,' v.
9, and C. iii. 29. 54n.] Horace says if
110 10 wanted with this illustration he is
willing to resign every thing; by which
110 means, if 11010 compared to the fox
who 11011801 11 :o a 010το 01111 had become
so fat 110 gocould not get 0111 agaim 71:
011101· wei-ds, 11· it was supposed that he
had become lazy and wlf-indulgent, and
that 110 0011111 not assert 1110 own liberty
till 110 should east off the bounties of his
patron, he was willing 10 give them up;
γ for 110 101011 the peace that waits upon
povertv, not as those do who commend it
at ricli tables spread with dainties, but as
0110 who would not exchange his ease and
liberty for the wealth of Arabia (compare
G. 111. 1. 213 iii. 24. 1. Epp. i. 6. 6).
‘ Altiles’ were fattened poultry and other
birds, for which service there 11010ρο1·-
“nomm persons employed (⁴ fartores‚' σιτευ-

‘Rex‚' which is generally used in a bad
001100 (C. i. 4. 14 n.)‚ is here 110011 111 a

‘’Verecundum means ‘reverentiaL’ or
[‘ respectful '.] It expresses that feeling
11111011 Cicero says is the greatest orna-
ment of friendsbiix‘ ‘Nam maximum or-
namentum amicitiae 101111. qui ex ea tollit
verecundiam” (Lael. c. 22). Horace says
that Maecenas 11011 always found him full
of affectionate respect and gratitude, and
what 110 was in 1110 presence he was no
less 111 1110 absence, bnt 110 must not
think so ill of him as to suppose he only
behaved so because 110 wished to keep his

1101111110 or tf he thought so, let him see
how 111111 ng ‘y be could 1-001811 it, as readily
as Telemachus 1100Ιί11011 the horses 01· Me-
nelaus (Odyss.· 11. 601): —

ἐν δ’ Ἰθάκῃ οὔτ’ ἂρ δρόμοι εὐρέες οὔτε τι
0123?sssz μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος ἱπποβότοιο.

45. omum Tibur] ‘Vacuum’ is ‘otio-
snm,’ ‘idlef as in Epp. ii. 2. 81, “vacuas
Athenas? [and 111 1. 50 01· 11110 epistle.]
ln the life of Horace attributed to Sue-
tonius, it is said that he had a house at
Tibur, and that it was shown aa his house
at the time that memoir was written.
That 110 was much at Tibur is certain;
that he had a house of his own there I do
not believe, for he never even alludes inci-
dentally to such a 'on. 'I‘hose who
wish to know all that has been said on
each side can read an Excursns of Obba-
rius on v. 12 01· 1110 next Epistle. As to
‘imbelle Tarentum,' see S. ii. 4. 34 n.

46. Philippus] L. Marcius Philippus
was consul ΔΑΜ). 663, and censor amne.
668. He was an energetic supporter 01·
1110 popular cause, a friend of Cn. Pom-
peius and a powerful orator. Cicero de·
scribes him aa “hominem imprimis diser-
tum atque eruditum, qui ita solet ad
dicendum su ut qnod primum
verbum habiturus sit nesciat: et nit
idem quum brachium concalefecerit tum
sesolerep p’ugnare ’(00 Orat. ii. ⁷8. See
0100· 111. 1 for his 118010υο langa nguage 10-
wards the senate). “Duobus igitur sum
mis Crasso et Antonio L. Philippus prox-
ime accedebat, sed longo intervallo 10111011
