80 HORATII FLACCI

tell, some support to thisnotion by saying of Bassus, one of the friends introduced in.
this ode, that “ if Quintus Caecilius Bassus, whom we read of in Cicero aud other writers
as a leading person among the Pompeiau party, had a son, he would be just such a youth
as we want” to fill that part. It is generally believed, however, that the person who
forms the principal subject of this ode had lately return'ed from the army in Spain, either

with Augustus A.U.c. '730 or a little while before.

ARGUMEN T.

Let us sacrifice 10 the guardian gods of Numida on his safe return from Spain ς 116 is

of their early days. Mark the fair day with a white mark ,bring out the wine with-

rose, the parsley, the lily, for our feast. Though all eyes shall languish for Damalis,
she will cleave only to Numida. ι

the Scholiasts interpret ‘ patrono,’ and
apply it to Lamia, as if he had been the

invented the term παιδῶναξ after the 8118·
logy of χειρῶναξ, but he did not pretend
that the Greeks used such a term. If such
is Horace's meaning here, the expression
stands alone. It occurs nowhere else in

patron of Numida in his youth, which

would imply that he was a freedman. Tur-⁴

nebus (Adv. ix. 14), who is followed by
Lambinus, Stephanus, Heinsius, Graevius,
Sauadon‚ Dacier, and others, understand
‘ non alio rege ’ to mean ‘under the same
schoolmaster‚' ‘rege' being equivalent to
‘custode,' A. P. 161, 811(1 ‘rectores' in
Tac. Ann. xiii. 2: “ Rectores imperatoriae
juventae,” i. e. Seneca and Burrus, the
teachers of Nero and Britannicus. This
opinion is adopted by Doering and Orelli,
and it is supported by v. 9. Dillenbr. and
others explain this passage by Epp. i. 1.
59: “pueri ludentes rex eris aiunt,” and
make ‘rege' the king of the gamo. As
in the scene described by Tacitus (Ann. xiii.
15) ε “ Festis Saturno diebus, inter alia ae-
qualium ludicra, regnum lusu sortientium,
evenerat ca sors Neroni '’ &c. Landinus
says it may mean king of the feast, συμ-
ποσίαρχος. When Sanadon says that the
Greeks and I atius used to call the teachers
of children their kings or governors, he is
merely deeeiving the ignorant. Heinsius

Greek or Latin authors in this sense, though
it may have been used in a familiar way;
and I think this is the true explanation.

puertiae] Other instances of syncope are
‘ lamnae‚’ ‘ surpuerat: ‘surpite,' ‘ soldo,’
‘ caldior? ‘ erepsemus' (S. i. 5. 79).

10. Ores-ra ne careat pulchra dies nota]
The Scholiasts all affirm that it was a eus-
tom with the Cretans “dies laetos albis
calculis, nigris contrarios, numerare ''
(Acron). “ Calculis quos in pharetras mit-
tebant ’' adds Porphyrion, by way of giving
probability to his story by particularity.
But so there would be no learning whether
a black or a white pebble were intended,
since both were Cretan. The same obj ec-
tion applies to ‘'Thressa, which has been
proposed as 8 substitution for ‘Cret-ssa:
because, according to Pliny (Nat. Hist. vii.
6. 40), the practice was observed by the

Thracians. pTliat the custom of marking .

fair days with 8 white stone or mark, and
unlucky ones with a black‚ had passed, if
not into practice, into a proverb with the
Romans, is well known. Hence Persius
