HORATII FLACCI

Ac non verba sequi fidibus modulanda Latinis,

Sed verae numerosque modosque ediscere vitae.

Quocirca mecum loquor haec tacitusque recordor: > 145
“ Si tibi nulla sitim finiret copia lymphae,

Narrares medicis ς quod quanto plura parasti

Tanto plura cupis, nulline faterier audes ’.Ρ

Si vulnus tibi monstrata radice vel herba

Non fieret levius, fugeres radice vel herba 150

Proficiente nihil curarier.

Audieras, cui

Rem di donarent illi decedere pravam

Stultitiam ς et cum sis nihilo sapientior ex quo

Plenior eS‚ tamen uteris monitoribus isdem ⁴?

At si divitiae prudentem reddere possent, 155
Si cupidum timidumque minus te, nempe ruberes

Viveret in terris te si quis avarior uno.

Si proprium est quod quis libra mercatur et aere,

Quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus ς

Qui te pascit ager tuus est, et villicus Orbi, 160
Cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,

Te dominum sentit.

Das nummos, accipis uvam,

Pullos, ova, cadum* temeti: nempe modo isto

[151. Audieras,cwi δια] ‘Yon had heard,
I suppose, that if the gods gave a man
wealth, perverse folly quitted him 3' and
you find by experience that it is not so.]

[157. uno] ‘ Than you especially,’ ‘you
of all others.’] ‚

158. quod quis libra mereatur et aere]
The mode of sale ‘ per aes et libram ' is
described by Gaius (i. 119). Α third per-
son held a pair of scales (‘ libra') which the
purchaser touched with a piece of money,
at the same time laying his hand on the
thing purchased. According to a set form
of words he claimed the thing as his own,
and handed the money to the seller as a
token of the sum agreed upon. This form
of purchase was called‘ mancipatio. ’ The
sellper was said‘ mancipio dare' (to which

‘mancipare' in this place is equiyalent), and
the purchaser was said‘ mancipio accipere?
When property of the nature of‘ res man-
cipii’ came into a man 's possession with-
out the regular forms of ‘mancipatio’ or
‘ injure cessio' (both of which are explained
in the Diet. of Antiquities), he was not
owner ‘ex jure Quiritium' until he became
so by ‘ usucapio‚’ that is, by having been
in possession for a certain time, varying
according as the things were ‘ res mancipi'
or not. If ιιο one claimed owncrship in it

before the expiration of that time, he who
had it became owner, as much as if he had
received it by ‘mancipatam' Hence ‘ usus’
is said ‘ mancipare: because the effect is the
same whether a man ‘possidendo usucapiat’
or ‘ mancipio accipit? Before ‘quaedam’

‘si’ must be supplied again. [‘ Consultis· ·'
S. 1. 1. 9.

160. υὲῑίἰεαε Orbi] Orbius 1s any body
who had land and sold the produce. As to

‘villicus’ see Epp. i. 14. 1 n.

161. Oum segetes occat] Cicero says
(Cat. Maj.c.15): “quae (terra) cum gre-
mio mollito ac subacto sparsum semen exce-
pit, primum id occoecatum cohibet, ex quo
occatio quae hoc efficit nominata est.'' This
is a bad attempt at etymology. The place

which this process of harrowing had in the ’

year’s work is marked in a passage of Plau-
tus (Capt. iii. 5. 3 sqq.)‚ where Hegio calls
Tyndarus—-

“Sator sartorque scelerum et messor ,

maxume ;’'
and he answers :

“ Non occatorem dicere audebas prius Ρ
Νἶιιιιιεέἰῗῖιέει· occant prius quam sarriunt
‘ Sar-rire ’ is ‘ to weed.’
