224 HORATII FLACCI

establish Horace in the high position he here asserts as “ Romanae fidicen lyrae ;” and
when, after several years' silence, he produced the Carmen Seculare in Asty-c. 737, it
was received probably with so much favour as to draw forth this ode. That is at any
rate a reasonable way of determining its date, which otherwise must remain wholly

· unknown. The ode has all the appearance of genuine feeling, and shows how much

Horace had suffered from the vexatious detractions that at one time he was subject to.
Sauadon declares it- is “perfectly beautiful‚’' and Dacier says “rien de plus acheve,''
nothing more finished, is to be found in the Greek or Latin language. J ulius Scaliger
would rather have written it thau have been king “ totius Tarraeonensis.'’ Ι confess
there is no ode that strikes me as more terse or more elegantly written thau this. It
is much less artificial than the first ode of the first book, with which it is usually
compared.
- ARGUMENT.

He on whom thou lookest at his birth, Melpomene, derives his fame, not from the
games, or from triumphs, but from the streams and woods of Tibur inspiring him
with Aeolian song. They have named me the tnner of the Roman lyre, aud envy
assaults me no longer as it did; and to thee I owe this gift of pleasing, O Mnse, who
rulest the shell, and art able to give the music of the swan to the voiceless fish if

thou wilt.
QUEM tu, Melpomene, semel
Nascentem placido lumine videris,
Illum non labor Isthmius
Clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico 5
Victorem, neque res bellica Deliis
Ornatum foliis ducem,
Quod regum tumidas contuderit minas,
Ostendet Capitolio :
Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt 10
Et spissae nemorum comae
Fingent Aeolio carmine nobilem.
Romae principis urbium
Dignatur suboles inter amabiles
Vatum ponere me choros, 15
Et jam dente minus mordeor invido.
O, testudinis aureae
Dulcem quae strepitum, Pieri, temperas,
O mutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cycni, si libeat, sonum, . 20
