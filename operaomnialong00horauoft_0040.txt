Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis. 10
Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo

Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cypria

Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.

Laudat rura sui 3 mox reficit rates
Quassas indocilis pauperiem pati.

has given a list of the principal verbs so
used. Verbs of all kinds signifying desire
and the reverse are frequently used with
the infinitive, as in this ode: “demere
spernit‚’' “refugit tendere ;'’ C. 9. 13,
“fuge quaerere,'' &c.· The student can
now observe this usage for himself.

10. de Libyeis verritur areis] See C. iii.
16. 26. 31. S. ii. 3. 87 3 and Cic. in Verr.
Aet. ii. 3. 14, Long's note. The ‘area’
was a raised floor on which the corn was
threshed 3 and aster the wind had winnowed
it the floor was swept, and the corn was
thus collected.

11. findere sarculo] There is ,some-
thing of contempt in these words, where
we should have expected ‘ arare? [There
is a contrast presented between a man's
small Italian estate, and the great pro-
vincial wheat-growing farms.] Fea refers
to Apuleius's description of Samos, where
“ ruratio omnis in sarculo et surculo —ager
frumento piger, aratro irritus ’' (Florid.
ii.). ‘ Scindere ’ is the proper word for the
plough 3 ‘findere ’ for the hoe or lesser in-
struments.—‘ Attalicis conditionibus ' sig-
nifies, ‘the most extravagant terms.’ There
were three kings of Pergamum of this
name, which was proverbial for wealth.
Of the second it is recorded, that he gave
large sums for paintings and other works
of art, as much as 100 talents for a single
picture (Plin. N. H. vii. 39). The third
Attalus left his great wealth and his king-
dom to the Romans (nc. 134); and the
name has passed into a proverb. See C. ii.
18. 5. Compare for ‘conditionibus' Cic.
ad Qu. Fr.i.l. 2: “Nulla conditio pecuniae
te ab summa integritate ‹leduxerit.”

13. dimoveas] Orelli says the difference
between ‘ dimoveo ' and ‘ demoveo,' which
some editions have, is that thc former is
used when a diversion into a new charmel
is intended, the latter when no such mean-
ing is to be expressed. Dillenbr. rever-ses
this statement, and reads ‘ demoveas? The
⁴meaning of the words must bc derived from

themselves, not from their use; for in the
conflict of MSS„ not only here, but in
{313³ ἓξ ἕὲὲἓεἽὲ ἓζὲῃξῗὶζῖῗὲὶὲξῖ “Rssfflg
meaning of ‘de,' ‘down from: 1 should
be inclined to say that ‘ demoveo’ is more
ΞζὲΡξέὲῖοὲἰιἪιὲῗρῖἓὲ.ἕῗὲἓρῗὲῒὲέἷῗὲἒ
‘ dimoveo ' when the sentence is absolute,
as here. For instance, ‘ demovet ’ 1 ima-
gine to be the proper reading in C. iv.
5. 14 ι “ Curvo nec faciem littore demovet‚”
where the MSS. have in many instances
‘dimovete Other examples will be found
by which the reader- mayjudge for himself.
The same remark applies to ‘diripio’ and
‘deripio.’ (C. iii. 5. 21 n.)—‘Cypria,’
‘Myrtoum,' ‘Icariis‚’ ‘Africum‚’ are all
particular names for general, as ‘Bithyna
carina' (C. i. 35. 7). This need hardly
have been mentioned, if reasons had not
been discovered for the use of ‘ Cypria‚’ in
which this common practice of Horace is
overlooked. Turnebus, for instance, ex-
plains ‘ Cypria ’ by the fertility of Cyprus,
which was so productive, that 1t could fur-
nish all the materials for a ship from its
keel to its top-gallant sails.-H0race's
epithets for Africus, which was the w.s.w.
wind, and corresponded to the Greek λίψ,
are ‘ praeceps,' ‘ pestilens,' ‘ protervus ’ (C.
iii. 23. 5). He uses the phrase ‘Africae
procellae’ (C. iii. 29. 57) to signify the
storms for which this wind was proverbial.
—‘Luctari,' ‘certare‚’ ‘decet-tarel ‘con-
tendere' are used by the poets with the
dative case, instead of the ablative with
‘cum,’ after the manner of the Greek
μάχεσθαί τινι.

16. otium et oppidiLaudat rura aui] He
commends the peaceful fields about his
native town ; sor ‘otium et rura’ may be
taken as one subject. Bentley prefers
‘ tut-a,' a conjectural reading of Valens Aci-
dalius (Com. on Vell. Patere. ii. 110), to
‘ rura,' and says he never met with an ex·
pression like ἕ· rura oppidi.” Orelli quotes
