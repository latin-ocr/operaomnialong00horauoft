garatf' [Ritter explains it ‘nec comitem
te abnegat‚’ which is more consistent with
⁸ 'l'e Spes‚’ &e.] Bentley, quite mistaking
the character of this passage, proposes to
read ‘vertis’ for ‘linquis’ v. 24.

28. Ferre jugus! pariter dolosi] This
:3¹¹² 7Ε“ε“)ἶωαῖξὲ.““ὶῗίῗοῖῗᾶωῗὲἧὲἓω
φωτί· πανροι δ’ ἐν πόνῳ πιστοὶ βροτῶν
Χαμύνου μεταλαμβάνειν. Theocritus has
a similar 'on (xii. 15), ἀλλήλους δ’
ἐφίλησαν ἴσᾳ (νγῷ, and Plautus (Au1u1.ii.

Ubi onus nequeam ferre pariter, jaceam
ego asinus in luto;”
the metaphor being obviously taken from
baum nnequally y.oked
29. ultan-oe Orybis Britannos] See In-
mancum. “Et penitus toto divisos orbe
Britannos” (Vir-g 1⁴:01. i. 67). Catullus
(On-m. xi.) has “ ultimosque Britannos?
Bentley objecta to ‘ultimos orbis,' and
proposes ‘ oro’ for ‘ orbis? He thinks the
exmsion harbarous, but admits that Vir-
gil wrote ‘extremique hominum Morini’
(Aen. viii. 727), which is sufficiently like
Horaee's phrase. Cunningham proposes
‘ultima’ But the MSS. do not vary.
They all have ‘ultimos orb1s.'

39. dffnyas retusum] This must have
been the reading of the Scholiasts, of whom
Acron says, “Dtffinqas, confusum reformes,
nam et sicut fingere formare dicitur, sic ct
daffinqereestquassatum reformare. Retu-
nm, civilibus bellis hebetatum ;'’ and Pcr-
phyrion, “ut ferrum quod retudimus in

corporibus nostrorum bello civili diffingas
(i. e. refabrieae) adversus Barbaros.” This
gives a very good meaning; but ‘diffingas’
oecurs only in Horace, who uses it here
and in C. iii. 29. 4¹7. MS. authority on
words compounded with ‘di’ and ‘de’ is
not to be trusted (C. i. 1. 13 n.). Some
goodMSS. have ‘de ³ and one ‘recu-
sum .’ Bentley adopts ‘defingasss saying that
nothing ean be more alien from Horace’s
affigas? masmim ἐξ
gives to ‘defingas’ he does not my. For

‘'retusum hep proposes ‘’recoctum out of
his own head, there-by losing one of the
chief points in the sentence, the blunting
of the sword on the bodies of their brethren,
as Cunningham observes (Animad. v. p.
346). ‘Recusum incude’ isjustly objected
to. The MSS. are in the proportion of
four to one in favour of ‘diffingas retu-
sum; ’and all the old editions have that

who Numida was we have no means of kuowing. That his gentilician name was
Plotius is stated by Comm. Cruq„ while the other Scholiasts‚ Acron and Porphyrion, call

- him Pomponius. But Numida appears to have been a cognomen of the Plotia ⁰1· Phufifl

gens (Estre, Prosop. p. 480). That he was an intimate friend of Horace appears from

He was also a great friend of Lamia (see C. 26 of this book). Baxter sup-

poses him to have been one of Sextus Pompeius’ party, and to have returned to Rome
frum following Sextus in Spain with Augustus’ pardon, which he infers from the unusual
Joy Horace expresses. Buttmann seems to give, whether designedly or not 1 cannot
