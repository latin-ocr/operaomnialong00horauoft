CARMINUM 1. 7.

Carmine perpetuo celebrare et

Undique decerptam fronti praeponere olivam.
Plurimus in J unonis honorem

Aptum dicet equis Argos ditesque Mycenas.

Nec tam Larissae percussit campus opimae,
Quam domus Albuneae resonantis

more literally ‘an olive· branch from every

(Η v..82 Sop...hOedC01694sqq.).
Following the conjecture of Erasmus,
Lambinus and many of the earlier editors,
including Dacier, preferred reading‘ undi-
que decerptae frondi praeponere olivam?
‘to prefer the olive to boughs gnthered
from all other trees.' But as Bentley

of all the MSS. which 18 that of the
text. ‘Indeque’ (omitting ‘et ') would
not be a bad emendation, if emendation
were wanted. It is adopted by Mitsch.
‘Arces’ is the reading of some MSS. for
⁸ nrbem,’ and Bentley adopts it on the usual
ground, that it is the 1888 likely word of
the two to have been coincd, but the best
MSS. have ‘ urbem?

to be equivalent to ‘ plurimi ;’ others take
it in the sense of ‘copious‚’ ‘one who ex·
penda much labour on his subject.’] ‘In
honorem, ’ ‘to do honour to. ’ Propertius
(iv. 6. 13) says,‘ ‘Caesaris in nomen du·
cuntur carmina? which is an 8881030118

Cicero (Tusc. v. 27) says, “Pueri Spar·

and’ 111 the aoristic perfect it savours very

much of ἔπληξε, 81111 the ode has traces of

12. Albuneae resonantis] One of the

Sibyls worshipped at Tibur gave her name
to a grove and fountain. See Virg. (Aen.

vii. 81 sqq.) ς

“lucosque sub alta
Consulit Albunea= nemorum quae maxima
sacro

Fonte sonat.’'

13. Tiburni lum] Tiburnus (or -tus)
Catillus and Coras were the my tbi-cal
founders of Tibur. Aen. vii. 670:

“Tum gemini statres Tiburtia moenia
Γὲἑὲῗῧῗωῇ dictam cognomine gen-

The brothers had a ‘cultus' there and a
grove. Tiburnus was the tutelar deity of
Tibur, as Tiberinus was of the river Tiber,
Auienus of the Anio, &c- They are in
fact adjectivoe. Tibur was famous for its
orchards. See Prop. iv. 7. 81. “Pomosis
Anio qua spumiferp incubat arvis? and
Ovid‚ Am. 111. 6. 45= “Tiburis Argei pomi
fera arva rigas’ ’('1f Bentley 18 right in
reading‘ pomifera' for· s pumifer').

there were those who divided the ode at
this place into two, and in some MSS. this
division is found 81111 8 fresh inscription for
the latter half. “Hanc Oden quidam
putant aliam esse, sed eadem est.’' q.Porph
