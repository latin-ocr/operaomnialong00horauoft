212 HORATII FLACCI

uproar, the wealth and smoke of the city. The rich man often likes to sup at the
poor man’s table. The days of drought are come back 3 the shepherd seeks the shade,
the flock seeks the stream, not a breath is on the river-banks: but thou art distracting
thyself with imaginary dangers. Heaven has wisely hidden the future from man, and
does but smile at his fears. Live for the present ς all else is like the stream that now
flows in peace, now is swollen to a flood and sweeps all with it to the sea. He lives
happy who lives to-day and leaves to-morrow to Heaven, seeing that Jove himself
cannot undo what is done. As to Fortune she is fiekle, and changes from day to day.
If she stays with me Ι am glad, if she flies I am resigned. If the storm rages I have
no merchandize to fear for, and can put out into any sea with safety in my little bark.

1. Tyrrhena regumproyenies] Compare
C. i. 1. 1. ‘Verso’ is equivalent to ‘moveri'

in “moveri digna bono die'' (C. iii. 21. 6)
[or it means ‘ opened']. The ‘balanus’ was

remain, and Pliny said that it no lon
existed in his time (H. N. iii. c. 5). [‘Sem-
per udum Tibur :⁵ see C. i. 7. 14. Perhaps
‘semper’ goes with ‘ udum.’]

an oleaginous nut of some kind, and is here
put for the oil expressed from it. [Ritter
refers to Pliny H. N. xii. c. 21.]

5. Eripe te morae] On this use of the
dative see Key's L. G. 980.

6. Ne semper udum] The MSS. vary
between ‘ne,³ ‘nec,' ‘and ‘non.' Orelli
prefers the abrupt form, which Dillenbr.
says is ‘ingratum.’ Ι rather agree with
Orelli, though ‘ nec’ would do very well.
[Ritter has ‘nec.'] Horace uses ‘nec’ in
prohibitions (C. i. 9. 15; 11. 2; iii. 7. 29). It

- appears that Maecenas was sighing for thc

country all the time he was detained at
Rome. Telegonus, son of Ulysses and
Circe, was the reputed founder of Tuscu-

10. Molem] This signifies Maecenas' pa-
lace on the Esquiliae at Rome, [from which
he could see Tibur and Tusculum, Strabo,
p. 238.] It is mentioned in Epod. ix. 3.

11. Omitte] This is the only instance
in this book of an iambus at the beginning
of the third verse of the Alcaie. It occurs
four times in the first book and twice in the
second. It does not occur in the foui-th.

15. aulaeis et ostro] The meaning of
‘ aulaeis' is explained in Sat. ii. 8. 54:
“ Interea suspensa graves aulaea ruinas
fecere‚'’ where, Porphyrion tells us it was
usual to spread tapestry to catch any duat
that might fall from the ceiling. ‘ Aulaeis
et ostro ’ may form one subject, or ‘ ostro’

lum and Praeneste. One of the legenda may mean the coverings of the couches.

of Ulysses' death attributes it to this son.
Aesula was probably a town between Prae-
neste and Tibur, but no traces of the site

16. Sollicitam explicuere frontem]
Sat. ii. 2. 125: “ Explicuit vi‘no con·
tractae seria frontis.”
