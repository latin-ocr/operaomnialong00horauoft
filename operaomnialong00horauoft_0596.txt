HORATII FLACCI

pleasure ς it is dearly bought with pain. The covetous never has enough, therefore

set bounds to your desires.

Envy ever pines over others’ success, a greater torment than ever tyrant invented.
Anger too, if it be not under control, will urge you to do that you will wish
undone: it is a brief madness: it must be either servant or master: put a bit
or a chain upon it. The horse is trained to his rider's will; the bound is taught
to hunt; even so drink in instruction, my young friend, and give yourself up

to the wise. The cask keeps its odour long.

Think not however that I can

wait for you if you lag behind, or keep up with you if you are too vigorous aud push

TROJANI belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,
Dum tu declamas Romae Praeneste relegi 5

1. maaeime Lolli] See Introduction.

2. Dum tu declama-r Romae] Horace
writes to Lollius as to one familiar with
Homer's poems. He says of himself, re-

fex-ring to his early education at Rome
(Epp. ii. 2. 41)·

“Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque
doceri

Iratus Graiis
Achilles.'’

- After the Romans had begun to expand
the course of their sons’ education (S. i.
6. 77 11.), Homer was one of the first
authors a boy studied. Pliny (Epp. ii.
14) has “Sic in foro pueros a centumvi-
ralibus causis auspicari ut ab Homero in
scholis.'’ Quintilian approved the prac-
tice: “ Optime institutum est ut ab Homero
atque Virgilio lectio inciperet, quanquam
ad intelligendas eorum virtutes firmiore
judicio opus esset '' (Inst. i. 8). Boys at-
tended the schools of the rhetorical mas-
ters before they put on the ‘toga virilis‚'
and there they learnt to declaim upon sub-
jects given them from history, of which a
bitter description is given by Juvenal (vii.
150 3 see also x. 166) :

“ I, demens, et saevas curre per Alpes
Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias?

quantum nocuisset

This practice was not introduced till the.
later years of the republic. In A.U.c. 662
the censors Cn. Domitius Aenobarbus and
L. Licinius Crassus issued this edict ε
“ Renuntiatum est nobis esse homines qui
novum genus disciplinae instituerunt: ad
quos juventus in ludos conveniat: eos sibi
nomen imposuisse Latinos Rhetoras: ibi
homines adolescentulos totos dies desidere.
Majores nostri quae liberos suos discere, et
quos 111 111(105 itare vellent, instituerunt.
Haec nova quae praeter consuetudinem ac
morem majorum fiunt, neque placent,
neque recta videntur. Quapropter et iis

qui eos ludos habent, et iis qui eo venire
consueverunt, videtur faciendum ut osten-
damus nostram sententiam, nobis non
placere ’³ (Sueten. (10 Rhet. c. 1). The
practice of declaiming with an instructor
did not cease when boys left school. They
had teachers at home. Lollius no doubt
had one. (See Introduction.)

— Praeneste relegi] Praeneste (Pales-
trina) was in Latium, about twenty-three
miles due east of Rome, on the edge of
the Apenniues. It was a cool retreat, to
which Horace appears sometimes to bave
gone *in summer, even when he had a
place of his own elsewhere. See C. iii. 4.
21 sqq.:

vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos, 5011 mihi frigidum
Praeneste seu Tibur supinum
Seu liquidae placuere Baiae.'’

 

It suffered greatly from the cruelty of
Sulla for sheltering the younger Marius,
but afterwards recovered itself and be-
came a place of fashionable resort for the
sake of the climate, which Strabo notices
(v. p. 365). Juvenal calls it “ gelida.
Praeneste ’' (iii. 190), aud couples it with
Tibur and other places as a retreat from
the disturbances of Rome, and he speaks
of one Centronius, who built villas

modo curvo ’

Littore Caietae, summa nunc Tiburis arce,

Nunc Praenestinis in montibus, alta para-

Cuiliiiina villarum, Graecis longeque pe-

Mil-laribus, vincens Fortunae atque Her·
culis aedem.” (xiv. 86 sqq.)

There must therefore have been some fine
houses there, for the temple of Fon-tune at
Praeneste was a handsome building3 and
Sulla, by way of making up to the in·
habitants for his barbarity‚ beautified this
