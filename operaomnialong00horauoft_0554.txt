HORA'PII FLACCI

Instituunt, sic dis placitum, tu carminis esto

Principium. Romae sponsorem me rapis.

Eia,

Ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, urge.

Sive Aquilo radit terras seu bruma nivalem

Interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est.

Postmodo, quod mi obsit clare certumque locuto,
Luctandum in turba et facienda injuria tardis.

“ Quid vis, insane, et quas res agis ‘?” improbus urget

Iratis precibus ;

“ tu pulses omne quod obstat,

Ad Maecenatem memori si mente recurras ?’'

Hoc juvat et melli est3 non mentiar.

Ventum est Esquilias, aliena negotia centum

Per caput et circa saliunt latus.
Roscius orabat sibi adesses ad Puteal cras.'’

, 23. sponsorem me rapis] ‘ Sponsor’

was one who became security for another
under the form of contract called ‘ver-

borum obligatio,' the contract taking
place by question and answer, ‘ex inter-
rogatione et responsione.' One asked the
’ other, “Dare spondes {³¹³ and 118 answered
‘spondc0.’ 'she principals were the ‘sti-

sponsor was said ‘ intercedere‚' and to him
the same question was put, to which he
returned the same answer (see Dict. Ant„
arts. ‘ lntercessio,’ ‘Obligationes'). This
explains ‘ respondeat ' in v. 24, and ‘⁶ quod
mi obsit clare certumque locuto‚” v. 27.
He answers ‘spondeo' in a clear distinct
voice, and becomes liabIe, possibly to his
great detriment. The words ‘ Eja, ne
prior-‚³ &c., may represent what is passing
in Horace's own mind, as some suppose,
but inore probably 118 means them for the
words of J anus, to whom he attributes the
prompting of his zeal.

26. Inter-iore diem gyro trahit] Cicero
renders a line of Aratus respecting the
Cynosura, “ Nam cursu interiore brevi
convertitur orbe '⁹ (De N. D. ii. 41). The
notion is that of the heavenly bodies
moving round a centre in a series of
orbits of which the diameters gradually
diminish, and in the winter solstice tra-
vex—sing the innermost and shortcst circle.
[⁶ Bruma ’ is the winter solstice.]

29. improbus uryet iratis precibus]
‘ Imp robus' means here ‘hot tempered‚'
and ‘precibus' curses, as in Epod. v. 86.
[Doederlein writes‘ Quid tibi vis insane,
et quam rem agis improbus?' He is
right in arguing that‘ improbus’ more

is an angry way of speakingst are you
the man to knoek down every thing
in your way? as in the next Satire
(v. 40),‘ ςΤιι, cum sis quod ego et for-
tassis nequior, ultro Insectere.'' There is
sal-casm in ‘memori‚' as if he was not
likely to forget his duty to the great man.
He says he feels 811 inward pleasure at the
testiniony thus borne to his intimacy with
Maecenas. so at least I understand the
words‘ hoc juvat? dte. Orelli [and Rit-
ter] say he is deli ghted to run back to
Maecenas. 1 do not think that is the
meaning. In v. 29 Ι have followed the
reading of all the best MSS. Bentley and
others have different readings. In a few
MSS. ‘tibi' has been inserted between
‘quid' and ‘ vis' according to a common
formula3 and this has made it necessary
to alter ‘ quas res ³ into ‘ quam rem‚’ which
Bentley has done on his own authority;
but three of Torrentius' had “quid tibi
νίε, quas res agis, insane ?'’ ‘ Si recurras’
means in the hopes of getting back, to see
if you can get back. See S. 5. 87 n.

32. atras—Esquilias] See S. i. 8, In-
troduction. The former character of the
place is expressed by ‘ atras‚' gloomy. He
says, as soon as he is near Maecenas’ house
he begins to remember a. hundred different
commissions entrusted to him by his ac-
quaintance. They flit about him like a.
swarm of gnats, or any thing else that is
teasin

35. gRosc-ius orabat] Roscius may be
any body. It appears he had pressed
Horace to appear next day, probably as
his sponsor, at the Puteal 1 ibonis. Acron
on this passage calls it‘ ‘locus Romae ad
