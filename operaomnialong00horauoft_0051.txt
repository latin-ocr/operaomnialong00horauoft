CARMINUM 1. 3. 15

Reddas incolumem precor,

Et serves animae dimidium meae.

Circa pectus erat qui fragilem truci ιο
Commisit pelago ratem

Primus, nee timuit praeeipitem Africum
Decertantem Aquilonibus

Nec tristes Hyadas, nee rabiem Noti,
Quo 11011 arbiter Hadriae 15

Major tollere seu ponere volt freta.
Quem Mortis timuit gradum

· Qui siccis oculis monstra natantia,

Greek proverb: φιλία ἐστὶ μία ψυχὴ ἐν

an imitation of the Greek, as Aaeeh. Prom.

There is no necessity for interpreting this
with Dillenbr. as a shield of oak aud breast-

man whose heu-1: is hard as if maed in oak
and a triple ooat of brass, and that is
enough. A good metaphor is osten spoilt
by explanation. Tibullus applies the same
with some play on the words to

the inventor of swords (i. 10. 1) =
‘⁶ Quis fuit hgrrendos primus qui protulit

enses

bidus Hadriae’ (C. iii. 3. 5). ‘ Ponere freta' is

unauthorized (except by Heinsius, who did
it before him) substitutes ‘ rectis* for ⁸ sic-
cis? considering that fear is not a passion
to draw forth tears. But the aneients were
less exact in aser-ibing the proper signs to
emotion, or they wept less sparingly than
rnen do now. Caesar describing the effect
of sear on his men says, ‘⁶ Hi neque vultum
fingere neque interdum lacrimas tenere
potuerunt” (B. G. i. 39). Bentley may have
been led to the word ‘ rectis' by Dryden's
translation, “ who unconcerned with sted-
fast eyes could view ? ’' But nothing is less
