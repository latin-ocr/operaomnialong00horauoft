HORATII FLACCI

Ut Argonautas praeter omnes candidum

Medea mirata est ducem,

10

Ignota tauris illigaturum juga
Perunxit hoc Iasonem;
Hoc delibutis ulta donis pelh'cem

Serpente fugit alite.

Nec tantus unquam siderum insedit vapor

Siticulosae Apuliae,

15

Nec munus humeris efficacis Herculis

Inarsit aestuosius.

At si quid unquam tale concupiveris,

J ocose Maecenas, precor

Manum puella savio opponat tuo
Extrema et in sponda cubet.

first (either in Epod. v. or Sat. i. 8), and
he was twenty-four when he arrived in
Rome. Unless therefore he became ena-
moured of her in her old age, she could not
have been an old woman when he gave her
this name. The boy in Ep. v. 98 curses
her and her fellova‚ and predicta that the
will be stoned for a set of wicked old
women, and Priapus describes her with
false tect-h (S. i. 8. 48); but these words
need not be taken literally. In Ep. xvii.
47, Horace says she is not an old woman 3
and there is no reason to suppose she was,
though most probably she was not young.
It is impossible, from Horace's poems, to
gather the cause of his anger against this
woman or his connexion with her. If Gra-
tidia was her real name, the fictitious one
was framed on the principle noticed C. ii.
12, Introduction.

9. praeter omnes] Orelli directs us to
take these words with ‘ candidum,’ not with
‘mirata est? Ι prefer taking them with
the latter. Horace assigns opposite qua-
lities to the poison in Medea’s hands. It
protects Jason and destroys Creusa (or
Glauce) his betrothed. (Epod. v. 63.)

[13. delibutis] Ep. xvii. 31.]

15. insedit vapor] ‘Vapor’ is equivalent
to ‘ calor? the effect to the cause (see For-
cell. for examples, aud also of ‘efficax').
⁶ Siderum vapor' is the heat of the dog·

days.

t . Compare Ep. xvi. 61: “Nullius
as ri

Gregem aestuosa torret impotentia?
The arid unwatered character of Apulia
has been noticed before (C. iii. 30. 11).
South of the Aufidus there was not a stream
till you reached the Galaesus near Taren-

y tum. This caused the arrangement men-

tioned by Varro in the passage quoted on
Epod. i. 27. The northern part of Apulia
was better watered, and very fertile.

[16. Apuliae] See C. iii. 4. 10 n.

17. Nec munus humeris] i. e. the gnr-
ment smeared with the blood of Nessus,
given by Deianira to Hercules. [Sopho-
cles, Trachiniae.] See Epod. xvii. 31.

21. savio opponat tuo] The editors
generally have ‘ savio‚’ and not ‘suavioz’
Forcell. makes them both· the same word,
and says they were from ‘suavisR Jahn
denies this, and says ‘savium’ means ‘a up!

[22. sponda] Ritter combats Orelli’s
notion that ‘ sponda’ is a bed, andinoppo-
sition to Orelli and other commentatore,
he maintains that the ‘ puella’ is no other
woman than Maeeenas’ wife Terentia. He
fixes the date of the ode a little aster the
marriage, and he places the marriage in,
A.u.c. 725. Ritter has argued the matter,
and there is something to be said on both

sides as to the ‘puella ;' if it is worth the
trouble]
