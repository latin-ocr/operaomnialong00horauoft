HORATII FLACCI

Fas et beatae conjugis additum
Stellis honorem tectaque Penthei

Thracis et exitium Lycurgi.
Tu flectis amnes, tu mare barbarum,
Tu separatis uvidus in jugis

Nodo coerces viperino

Bistonidum sine fraude crines : 20
Tu, cum parentis regna per arduum
Cohors Gigantum scanderet impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
Unguibus horribilique mala ς
Quamquam choreis aptior et jocis 25
Ludoque dictus non sat idoneus
Pugnae ferebaris : sed idem
Pacis eras mediusque belli.

wrought as those in garden—hives. Virgil this description of Bacchus changed into a

says (Ec. iv. 30):
sudabunt roscida mella?

12. iterare] Forcellini does not notice
thisinstance‚but quotesothers from Plautus,
and one from Gellius (referred to by Orelli),
in which ‘ itero ’ signifies ‘ to relate! The
sense in those cases is, going over again in
narrative what had passed in action. Here,
I think, it is repeating what the poet had
heard from the god as he taught the
Nymphs to praise him.

13. beatae conjuyis] i. e. Ariadne, whose
crown is one of the constellations, ‘ corona, ’

placed in heaven by Bacchus according to ·

the story told in his happy manner by
Ovid (Fast. iii. 459—516).

14. tectaque Penthei] So Euripides of
the same person (Bacch. 663) :—

Ι
δέξατ’ ἔῤῥηξεῗαὲἕμὶῗζε· συντεθράνωται
’ ἅπαν.

17. Tu flectis amnes] The Hydaspes
. and Orontes which Bacchus is said to have
walked over dryshod.

[18. separatis] ‘Retired,’ lonely‚’ like
⁴ remotis.² Comp. C. ii. 2. 10. ‘Uvidus'
is equivalent to ‘ ebrius! Comp. iv. 5. 39. ]

19. Nodo coe'rces] This is a variation
of ‘ nodo cohibere crinem ’ (C. iii. 14.
221. The Bistones were a Thracian tribe.

‘Px-ause in this sense of harm, occurs C.
iii. 27. 27, andC. S. 41.

21. Tu, cum pan-entis] Horace followed

some legend not found by us elsewhere‘ m

“ Et durae quercus lion and fighting with Rhoetus, whose name

is Rhoecus in the editions of Lambinus and
Cruquius (who follows a correction of his
oldest Blandinian MS.), Baxter, Dacier,
and some others, as from Ῥοῖκος, who how-
ever was a Centaur. But all the best MSS.
(with the above exception, and there Rhoe-
cus is a corrected reading), and all the old
editions (according to J ani ς of the fifteenth
century 1 have only had access to the Vene-

tian reprint of Landinus, 1483, which has ’

Rhethum) have Rhoetum, or other forms

28. Pacis eras mediaeque belli] Dil-
lenbr. says, “Medius pacis et belli ap-
pellatur deus sua natura neutri parti
deditus, sed ut tempus fert modo bellicosus
modo pacis amans3 '³ and. quotes Epp.' 1.
18. 9: “Virtus est medinm vitiorum et
utrinque reductum.’' I think it means you
were the same whether engaged in (in the
midst of) peace or war3 tlte smne, i. e. as
vigorons in war as in the dance or jest So
Ι find Turnebus understands it, quoting no
better authority however than the Evan-
gelist St. John (i. 26), μέσος δὲ* υμῶν ἕστη-
κεν. St. Matthew also has (xiv. 24), τὸ δὲ
πλοιον ἤδη μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης ἣν. The
whole of this stanza offends the taste of
many editors, Their jndgment may be
just, but the verses appear suited to their
position, and worse might be found even in
