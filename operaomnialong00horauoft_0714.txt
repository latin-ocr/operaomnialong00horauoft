678 HORATII FLACCI

At neque dedecorant tua de se judicia atque 245
Munera, quae multa dantis cum laude tulerunt

Dilecti tibi Virgilius Variusque poetae 3

Nee magis expressi vultus per aenea signa,

Quam per vatis opus mores animique virorum

Clarorum apparent.

Nee sermones ego mallem 250

Repentes per humum quam res componere gestae,
Terrarumque situs et flumina dicere, et arces

Montibus impositas, et barbara regna, tuisque

Auspiciis totum confecta duella per orbem,

Claustraque custodem pacis cohibentia J anum, 255
Et formidatam Parthis te principe Romam,

Si quantum cuperem possem quoque ς sed neque parvum
Carmen majestas recipit tua nec meus audet

Rem tentare pudor quam vires ferre recusent.

(Hist. Greece, i. 13), who attributes it, not
to “ the dampness and thickness of their
atmosphere,’' but to the productiveuess
of the country. But it is hard to fix the

⁷ causes of national character, especially

after the lapse of centuries. [Alexander's
taste was sharp in judging of works of art
(videndis artibus), but if you had asked
his opinion of books and poetry (ad libros

. . vocares) you would have sworn that
he was as stupid as a Boeotiam]

245. tua de se judicia atque munera]
Respecting Vix-gil and Varius, and t-he
presents they are said to have received
from Augustus, see S. i. 5. 40 n. [‘ Dantis
cum laude τ’ ‘with much eredit to the
giver.' Ritter prefers ‘ tua munera multa
laude in te collata remunerati sunt. ’]

248. αὲηεα siqua] The word‘ signum'
applies generally to all carved or cast
figures, while‘ statua' applies only to full
length figures (Cic. in Verr. ii. 4. 7, Long's
note .

25)l. Repente-s· per humum] This is ex-
pressed by ¹ pedestris.' See C. ii. 12. 9 n.

252. arces· montibus impositas] See
C. iv. 14. 12, and 33 n. Suetonius (Aug.
21) says, “Domuit partim ductu, partim
auspiciis suis Cantabriam, Aquitaniam,
Pannoniam, Dalmatiam cum Illyrico
omni ε item Raetiam et Vindelicos ac Sa·
lassos.” The ‘ auspicia,' or power of taking
the auspices, the emperors scarcely ever
delegated to any one. The commanders
of their armies were ‘duces.' They had
not ‘imperiu1n,’ and therefore could not
have the ‘auspicia.’

255. Claustraque custodem pacis coln·-
benna] The Temple of Janus was built,

according to tradition, by Numa (Livy i.
19). The gates were open in war and closed
in peace, but according to Livy they were
only shut once between the reign of Numa
and the battle of· Actium. Ovid makes
the god explain the practice thus (Fast-
i. 279) :—

“Ut populo reditus pateant adbella profecto
Tota patet demp ta’ Janua nostra sera.

Pace fores obdo, ne qua discedere possit.
Caesareoque diu nomine clausus ero?

Horace’s explanation is that the gates were
shut during peace to prevent the guardian
from leaving the city. The first time the
gates were shut during the republic was
asne. 519. By Augustus the were closed
three times (C. iv. 15. 9 n.) rthe battle
of Actium and taking of Alexandria aar-c.
725, and after the Cantabrian war mmo.
729. The third occasion is not known5
Casaubon (note on Suetonius, Aug. c. 22)
says it was the year of Christ’s birth, on
the authority of Orosius, which is not
to be trusted. They remained closed till
the defeat of Varus Aa). 9, after which
they were open for nearly fiflzy years, being
closed by Nero ΑΛ). 58. They were im-
mediately opened again, aud not closed till
Λα). 71 aster the taking of Jerusalem.
There is no other record of the closing ot
these gates till aa). 353, when, according
to Ammianus Marcellinus (lib. xvi. 10),
Constantius 11. closed them after the defeat
and death of Magnentius. [See the note
in Gronovius' ed.] The practice then
remained under the Christian emperors.
