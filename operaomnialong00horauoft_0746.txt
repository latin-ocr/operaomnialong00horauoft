Si quid inexpertum scenae committis et audes

HORATII FLACCI

Personam formare novam, servetur ad imum
Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.
Difficile est proprie eommunia dicere3 tuque
Rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus,

Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus.

Publica materies privati juris erit, si

Non circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem,
Nec verbo verbum curabis reddere fidus
Interpres, nec desilies imitator in arctum

Unde pedem proferre pudor vetet aut operis lex.

Nec sic incipies ut scriptor cyclicus olim:

the strait that separates the Propontis from
the Euxine gave it the name of Bosporus,
are related in many ways. The most re-
markable passage on this subject is in the
Prometheus of Aeschylus, where she is
introduced. [Doederlein suggests that
‘ vaga ' means ‘ frantic.']
. [126. Personam] ‘A new character?
- S. i. 2. 60.-‘ Ad imum,' Epp. i. 18. 36.]
128. Difficile est proprie communia
dicere] ‘ Communia' means what is com-
mon property, as opposed to fictions of
one's own creating, and ‘proprie dicere ' is
to tell it so as to make it one's own.
[Vcrse 130 explains ‘communia.'] ‘Pro-
prie communia dicere’ seems to be the
same as making that which is ‘publica
materies’ ‘privati jur1s‚’ or a man's own.
“ Communia' is usual in the sense of part-
nership property, and is different from
‘ publica? but here it seems to have the
same meaning. Horace seems to have fol-
lowed a Greek proverb, χαλεπὸν τὰ κοινὰ
ἰδιῶσαι. As to ἕ deducis' see S. i. 10. 44 n.
Ruhnken on Timaeus (v. κάταγμα) points
out that in Plato κατάγειν has the same
sense as ‘deducere filum, ³ referring to
Sophist. p. 152, Ε, καὶ πρός γε τούτοις ἔτι
ξαίνειν καὶκατάγειν καὶ κερκίζειν ἐπιστάμεθα.
132. vilem patulumque moraberis or·
bem] With‘ orbis' Orelli compares Aris-
totle (Rhet. i. 9. 33): τὸ δ’ ἐγκώμιον τῶν
ἔργων ἐστίν· τὰ δὲ κύκλῳ εἷς πίστιν, οἷον
εὐγένεια καὶ παι ιδεία, in which he renders
τὰ κύκλῳ by ‘loci communes? Aristotle
seems to mean those collateral arguments
that help to build up the main argument
of the encomium, to be derived from ac-
tions. Horace means the hackneyed round
of subjects, phrases, and illustrations,
ground which any body may tread and may
have trod already. ‘ Patulus' is opposed
to ¹arctus‚’ difficult narrow ground, in

which it is not easy to move except by
treading precisely in the steps of him whom
you are following, in which diffidence or the
plan of the work hampers your steps and
prevents you from showing any originality.
[Some critics detect an allusion to the fable
of the fox and goat (Phaedrus, iv. 9). Ι
doubt that.]

136.] ut scriptor cyclicus olim] A class
of Epic poets arose some time aster Homer,

who, perhaps from the habit of reciting as Α

rhapsodists the Iliad and Odyssey, were led
to adopt subjects akin to Homer-’s and to
connect their poems with his. Their ⁶

appears to have been to form theirpoems and -

Homer' s into onecycle, embracing thewhole
history of the Trojan times, and sotheywere
called by the grammarians Cyclic poete.

Of these the oldest was Arctinus ofMiletus,
whose poem was a continuation of the Iliad,
and nearly as long·- lt took up the history
after the death of Hector, and related the
arrival of the Amazons and Ethiopians to
assist the Trojans, the death of Achilles by
the hand of Paris, the contest of Ajax and
Ulysses (Ovid, Met. xiii. 1), the story of
Laocoon and of the wooden horse, and „the
consequent sacking of Troy. virgil was
indebted to this poem for the greater part
of the second book of the Aeneid. It was
divided into two parts, of which the first
was called Αἷθίοπις, the second Ἰλίου πέρσις.
The second Cyclic poet in order of time wau
LescheS, a Lesbian, and contemporary with
Archilochus. His poemwas known as the
Μικρὰ Ἴλιός. The poem opened with these
two lines, which Horace may or may not
have had in mind :—

Ἴλιον ἀείδω mil Δαρδανίην εὔπωλον,

ἧς πέρι πολλὰ πάθον Δαναοὶ θεράποντες
Ἄρηος.

It appears to have embraced a. number of
