180 HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN XVI.

Horace here dwells on his favourite theme‚—contentment and moderation,—which he
is able to illustrate by the example of Maecenas as well as his own. The ingenuity which
has discovered the occasion that gave rise to this ode will hardly throw any new light on
the meaning of it, which is very plain. Whether therefore Horace’s friends had urged
him to make more than he had done of his opportunities with Maecenas for the purpose
of enriching himself or not may very well remain doubtful. Ι confess the idea would not
have occurred to me. The French editors suppose it tobe an ode of thanks to Maecenas
for the gift of the farm, which it certainly is n0t; and one editor, J. F. Schmid, suspects

. Horace meant gently to hint to his patron that he should be glad of an extension of his

liberality‚ a species of εἰρωνεία which it is to be hoped does not represent the principles
of the person who suggests 'this notion. There is no clue to the date of the ode further ”
than that it was written after Horace came into possession of his farm.

ARGUMENT.

A stout prison and savage watch-dogs might have kept Danae from harm3 but Jove and
Venus smiled, for they knew that the god need but change himself to gold, and the
way would be clear for him. Gold penetratcs through guarda ς gold shall burst
rocks3 thereby fell the house of Amphiaraus3 thereby the Macedonian won cities3
thereby steru admirals are ensnared. And as it grows the desire for more grows too.
A high estate Ι dread. Maecenas, thou good knight, the more a. man denies himself
the more the gods will give him. 1 fly from the rich to the contented, and am more
independent than any poor rich man in the world. My stream, and‘my little wood,
and my trusty field, are a happier portion than all Africa. Ι have no honey of Cala-
bria, nor wine of Formiae, nor Gaulish fleece, yet poverty doth not pinch me 5 and
if I wanted more thou art ready to give it. My small income will go further by the
restricting of my wants, than if Ι had all Lydia and Phrygia for my own. Who
ask much lack much. It is well with him who has enough.

1. Inclusam Danaen] The story of ‘Tristes excubiae’ is like Ovid’a ‘tristis
Danae, Acrisius' daughter, and the fable custodia servi’ (A. A. iii. 601). On the
of the shower of gold, are explained by tense ‘munierant‚’ see C. ii. 1'7. 28 n.
Horace in his own way. Compare the 6. Custodem pavidum] Acrisius shut up
chorus of Soph. Antig. (944): his daughter lest she should beara son who
