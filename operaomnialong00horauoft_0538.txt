502 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Tell me now, Tiresias, before we part, how I may repair my broken fortunes. Why
smile Ρ

What, is it not enough that Ι promise you a safe return Ρ

O true prophet, you see how Ι am naked and poor, eaten out of house and home by
those suitorS‚ aud what are birth and merit without money Ρ

Well, to be brief, since you have such a horror of poverty‚ 1 will tell you how to get
rich. If a friend sends you some game, pass it on forthwith to some rich old gen-
tleman, and take care he has the first fruits of your garden 3 never mind your Lares,
—he is better than they. Be he the lowest of the low, walk out with him and give
him the wall.

What, I give the wall to a. dirty slave Ρ So did 1 never at Troy.

Well then you must be content to be poor.

If that be so, then I must nerve my great heart. Tell me now how Ι am to act.

I repeat, you must fish for the old men’s wills; and though you may now and then have
only a nibble never give up in despair. If there is any suit going forward, don't ask
which of the parties has the best case but which is the richest; and if 118 118 without
children go up to him and offer your services; call him delicately by his praenomen3
tell him you love him for his virtues; you know the law, and will see that no one
defrauds him of his rights ς 118 may go home and make himself easy and leave the
matter in your hands 3 and then do you persovere and carry it through for him.
Summer or winter, never mind3 men will admire your zeal3 many fish will come
into your pond. Or if you know a widower with a sickly boy, try and get named
second heres, that γοα may step in if the lad dies. And when any one asks you
to read his will, affect reluctance, but get a glauce at the contents nevel-theles.—
It will happen occasionally that an astute fellow overreaches his man, as Coranus
will Nasica.

What is this Ρ Pray tell me if γοα may.

Iu times to come, when a son of Aeneas shall be mighty by land aud by sea, Nasica shall
marry his fair daughter to stout Coranus, and so think to get rid of his debts. Then
shall the son hand his testament to the father and pray him to read. He shall modoetly
decline; but, being pressed, shall read in silence and find that he and his are lest—
nothing !—But to go on. If the dotard has a tricksy damsel or a freedman that
manages him, make up to them 3 flatter them, and they will return the favour. But
it is best to attack the head first. Praise his bad verses if he is fool enough to write3
or if that isin his line, don’t wait till he asks, but of your own accord send him your
Penelope.

What, think you one so chaste, on whom her suitors could make no impression, would ·
consent to this Ρ

Τ118 suitors came with scanty gists and thought more of your kitchen than your wife.
Penelope is chaste till she shall have tasted of the old man's money.

There was a sly old woman at Thebes who made a provision in her will that her heres
should carry her on his shoulders, greased for the occasion, to burial, and if he
dropped her he was to forfeit. He had stuck to her all her life, and ahc hoped she
might shake him off in this way when she was dead. Take warning by this and
make your approaches carefully, neither too slack nor too impetuous ς be neither too
talkative nor too silent. Stand, like Davus in the play, with your head meekly bent
and your eyes on the ground. Push your way with servility: if the wind blows,
entreat him to cover up his dear head 3 clear his way in a crowd ς be all attention to
his prattle 3 if he is greedy of flattery ply him till he eries, Enough‚ and still blow him
up like a bladder. And when your boudagc is done, and the will is read, and you
