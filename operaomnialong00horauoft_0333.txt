Virtus sepulcrum condidit.

m. sinistrorsum citae] These words
may refer to the desei-tion of Antonius'

naval force, as the foregoing refer to his
Some of his ships either did not

’ enter the battle or quitted it and took

alnlter in some neighbouring harbour.
Whetber Horace means to be so precise as
to determine the true position of this har·
bour, 1 think doubtful, though there are
plenty of harbours iii the Ambracian Gulf
to which they may have fied. The Scho-
liam uid nearly all the old commentators
understand ‘sinistrorsum’ to mean ‘to-
wards Alexandri& and the ssight of An-
tonius and Cleopatra to be meant; but it
wan not known whither Antonius had fled
came to Rome and
this ode was written. 1 believe the mean-
ing of the words to be impenetrably· ob·
neure from our ignorance of the ancient
mutzioel phrases; but if we take‘ sinis-
trorsum' as signifying literally ‘to the
lest: it must be understood thzit the de-
serting ships made their escape from the
soene of action into the gulf, and there re-
mained till the battle was over. Bentley,
’ without acknowledging that Heinsius 1ιὲιί
preceded him with the same notion, sup-
, ffies ‘sinistrorsum citae’ may be equiva-
tto πρύμναν κρούει-ασθαι, ‘to back
ww: Something of that sort, con-
nected with flight, 1 have no doubt it
muns. Whether Horace exactly states
what he had heard, and whether the in-
ibrmation was precisely correct, we cannot
ton. He wrote while the tidings were
fresh, and probably gave only popular re-
porta. The defection of the Galatians is
mentioned 1)] Plutarch (Ant. 63). ‘Citae’
is the participle of‘ ciere!

21. Io Tri miglis] Triumphus is per-
sonified, as in C. iv. 2. 49.

- amoos cume] Philostratus (ὶ.
ἰιι his life of Dion, the sophist, says, the
EmperorTrajan used to take himys’ upby
his side on the gilded chariot used by oon-
quemrs in their triumphs. The form of
the char-iot is described by Zonaras (vii.
21) as that of a round tower: τὸ δὲ δὴ
zatum οὔτε dymno-rupim οὔτε πολεμιστηρίῳ

ἑ nepes, ἀλλ’ εἰς πύργου περιφεροῦς
τρόπων ἐξείργαστο (quoted by Turnebus,

ii. 16). Fom- horses, which on special
occasions were white, were used for draw-
ing the triumphal chariot. Heifers that
had not been under the yoke were offered
in sacrifice at the close of the procession.
Scipio Africanus Minor triumphed in
A.u.c. 608, and Marius in 650.

25. eui super Karthayinevn] All that is
here said about Scipio's tomb is that his
valour built him one on the ruins of Car-
thage‚ which is no more than a repetition
of C. iv. 8. 17. Acron's story that the
Romans, by command of the oracle, built
a tomb to Scipio at the mouth of the Tiber
looking towards Carthage, is no doubt a
fabrication ς and 'hii-nebus’ note, “cujus
sepulchro eversae Carthaginis titulus sub·
scriptus est‚’' if it were true would have
nothing to do with Horace’s words. No
doubt the conquest of Carthage was, as he
says, “titulo ιω digna sepulchri ” (Juv.
vi. 230). But Horace is speaking of a
tomb of renown, in which Scipio's memory
is enshrined, not his body. Bentley has a
long note here, the substance of which is
this: ‘Africanum’ may mean either the
elder or younger Scipio; if the elder is
understood, we must suppose that ‘se-
pulchrum' means Ennius' poem (C. iv. 8.
17 ιι. ), which was to him a tomb or monu-
ment‘ surpassing Carthage3’ but if the
younger is meant, then he proposes to
ch ange‘ cui' into‘ quo, ’that we may have

‘quo super‚' ‘on whose behalfss and the
tomb liis valour built him was Carthage.
Ee proves that Statius (Silv. ii. 7. 72) calls
Lucan’s Pharsalia “Pompeio sepulchrum ;”
and in aii epigram in the Anthology, Hee-
tor claims Homer’s poeni as his tomb. No
one oen deny that‘ quo super’ may mean

‘on behalf of whom? and that Carthage
might be called Scip io’ s tomb, as Salamis

7,) is 'Themistocles' in iihother epigiam. But

why the reading of all the MSS, which is
‘cui‚ ’should be gabandoned for‘ quo, ’it is
difficult to tell. Ι think it refers to the
younger Scipio, which gives the most ob·
vious meaning. Τ1ιο reference to Ennius’
poem would be too obscure. The applica·
tion to the elder is as old as Cruquius’
Scholiast. [Ritter takes the reading
‘Africano’ with which ‘bello' must be
