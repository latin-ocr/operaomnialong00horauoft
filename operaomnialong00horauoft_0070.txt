HORA'PII FLACCI

Beluis nec te, metuende certa

Phoebe sagitta.

Dicam et Alciden puerosque Ledae,

Hunc equis, illum superare pugnis
Nobilem ς quorum simul alba nautis

Stella refulsit

Defluit saxis agitatus humor,

Concidunt venti fugiuntque nubes,

30

Et minax, quod sic voluere, ponto

Unda recumbit.

Romulum post hos prius an quietum
Pompili regnum memorem an superbos

Tarquini fasces dubito, an Catonis

Nobile letum.

35

Regulum et Scauros animaeque magnae
Prodigum Paullum superante Poeno
Gratus insigni referam Camena

Fabriciumque.

Hunc et incomptis Curium capillis
Utilem bello tulit et Camillum

21. Proeliis audax] It will be readily
seen that Horace confounds the. Latin divi-
nity Liber with the Greek Dionysus or
Bacchus, whose Indian wars and contest
with the giants (C. ii. 19. 21) are here
alluded to. Bentley puts a stop after these
words and applies them to Pallas. [Ritter
also.

26]. Hunc equis—] S. ii. 1. 26.

29. Defluit saa-is agitatu-s· humor] The
waters that in their fury covered the rocks
flow back to their bed. Torrentius com-
paring Epp. i. 2. 42, “ Rusticus expectat
dum defluat amnis,’' renders ‘defluit’
‘ ceases to fiow down the rocks.5 Theocri-
tus describes a calm produced by the in-
fluence of the Twins (xxii. 17). [See also
Seneca, Nat. Qu. i. 1, ‘in magna tempes-
tate apparent quasi stellae velo insidentes.’
Adjuvari se tunc periclitantes existimant
Pollucis et Castoris numine. Ritter.]

34. superbos Tarquini fasces] It has

, been disputed whether this refers to Tar-
quinius Priscus or Superbus. But for the
epithet applied to ‘fasces' there could be
no doubt. The Scholiasta suppose Priscus
to be thc person alluded to, and more edi-
tors hold that opinion than the other.
'l'hose who contend for Superbus quote
Cicero, Phil. iii. 4, where comparing this
king with M. Antonius he makes him out

to be better than history draws him. But
Cicero spoke for a purpose, and his state÷
ments are chiefly negative. On another
occa sion he wrote differently, saying, ‘⁸ Quis
est qui—Tarquinium Superbum—non ode-
rit ?'' (De Am. 8). It may be admitted,
however, that the propriety of all the
names in this catalogue of worthies is not
obvious. Why, for instance, among so
small a number the Scauri should appear,
of whom the best, M. Aemilius, who was
consul A.U.c. 639, and who had qua-
lities mixed up with many that were bad,
was not worthy of so great a distinction,
nobody has attempted to explain. It is
certainly only necessary to sup M.
Aemilius Scaurus alluded to here as in
Juvenal, xi. 90, where he is introduced in
similar company, and in the plural num-
ber :—

“ Cum tremerent autem Fabios, durumque

Catonem,
Et Scauros, et Fabricios.”

The place in which Cato's name is men-
tioned is also an offence to some, and
Bentley wishes to sweep him ont altogether,
and substitute Curtius, reading ‘anne
Curti' for ‘an Catonis.’ But as he has
made no converts, and does not adopt his
own conjecture, it i's not neoessary to
meddle with his argument.
