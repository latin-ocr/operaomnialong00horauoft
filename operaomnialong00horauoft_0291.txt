CARMINUM IV. 14. 255

Exercet Auster, Pleiadum choro
Scindente nubes, impiger hostium
Vexare turmas et frementem
Mittere equum medios per ignes.
Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus,
Qui regna Dauni praefluit Apuli,
Cum saevit horrendamque cultis
Diluviem meditatur agris,
Ut barbarorum Claudius agmina
Ferrata vasto diruit impetu
Primosque et extremos metendo
Stravit humum sine clade victor,

’ξιι- ignes' Bentley proposes ‘perenseg'

„mandunedbyothemin the same
σας as Sil. Ital.² “per medios ignes
mediosque per enses³⁹ (xiv. 175); “per
mediasvolitare acies mediosque per ignes''
(xv. 41).. Ov. Met. viii. ¹76: “Ire per
ignes, par gladios ausim? 'Hie Scholiast
(Οαιιιιι. Oruq.) sufficiently explains ‘per
⁹ medium pugnae fervorem,
par medium ardorem belli.'’

25. hanswic] This istaken from the
Μ ταυρόμορφος, applied to the Cephisus
by Durip. (Ion 1261). The only other
Italian river that- was represented under
tm: form was the Eridanus, of which
virgil says (Georg. iv. 371 sqq.) :—

“Et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu
higlalnus, quo non alius per pinguia

In mare purpureum violentior effluit
tumis-’³

He was therefore repmented not only
n‘th horns, hut with gilded horus. Al-
though this featureis attributed to several
rivers by the poeta (to the Rhine by
ovid, Trist. iv. 2. 41, and to different
Greek strenuus, especially Achelous their
type. who lost one of his horns while con·
tmding with Hercules), none of them
nro so ted in the ancient works of
nrt that have snrvived. Horace has pro-
bphly invented this description of his native
nm hy way of magnifying its importance,
and making it with the greater streams.

 

described by Horace as a boisterous stream ;
and so Silius describes it, who had less
interest in magnifying its importance :—

“ Samus tumidas in campos Aufidus

Ejectat redditque furens sua corpora
ripis? (x. 320.)

But the character of such streams varied
greatly at different seasons of the year.

28. meditatur] This is the oldest and
most authorized reading, and that of the
Scholiasta one of whom, Porphyrion, finds
fault with it. ‘ M initatur ’ is the reading of
many MSS„ and some editors have adopted
it ; Bentley among others. His reasons
have no weight at all. The Scholiast’s
objection, that ‘ meditatur' denotes a sus-
pended action rather than one in pmgraes,
bad as it iz, is better than any of Bentley’s3
but it would apply equally or more to
‘minitaturf and the fact is that ‘ meditari ’
denotesan act as well as the premeditation
of it, like the Greek word to which it is
akin, μελετᾶν. See C. iii. 25. 5 n. It
does not, therefore, necessarily imply any
pause between the threat and the accom-
plishment of the threat in this instance. Ι
do not think therefore that Orelli has hit
the true force of the word, when he says it
is “sine dubio longe rotmmbreporss' be-
cause it expresses the silent and trembling
expectation with which men are looking
for the coming desolation.

31. radendo] Horace (like Virgil, Aen.
