270 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Thon art going into the midst of danger, Maecenas, to share the fortunes of Caesar. Δ
Shall I stay at home at ease, or meet the danger with thee, on whose life my happi-
ness depends? Ι will go with thee whithersoever thou goest. To what end shall I
go Ρ Α5 the bird fears less for her young when she is near them, so shall Ι fear less
for thee if I go with thee, and I go to win thy love, not thy favoni-s. Thy love hath
given me enough. I seek not wide lands or fine houses and cattle, and gold to hide

or to squander.

Ims Liburnis inter alta navium,
Amice, propugnacula,
Paratus omne Caesaris periculum

Subire, Maecenas, tuo.

Quid nos, quibus te vita sit superstite 5
J ucunda, si contra gravis?

Utrumne jussi persequemur otium
Non dulce ni tecum simul,

1. Liburnis] These were light vessels
that took their name from the ships used
by the Liburniam, a piratical tribe on the
Illyrium coast. Augustus employed them
in his expeditions against Sex. Pompeius,
and they were of great use at Actium (C. i.
37. 30). It is disputed whether ‘inter alta
propugnaculo) refers to Antonius’ ships or
(lausai-’s Horace is speaking of the danger
Maecenas is going to encounter, and it
could not be better described than by con-
trasting the light galleys of Caesar’s fleet
with the heavy ships of the enemy3 and
though there were ships of larger size in
Caesar's fleet (as Dillenbr. says, taking the
other view of the sense), the danger would
not have been described by mentioning
them. ‘Ibis inter' may not be a proper
phrase for describing an attack upon the
enemy’s fleet, but it may do very well for
contrasting the size of the ships on each
side. The danger would not have been
adequately described by representing Mae-
cenas as sailing in 3 light vessel among
the larger ones giving his orders, as some
have explained it. (Dion, 50, c. 31.) Such
a description would have diminished the
picture of danger, and only represented
the honour of the command. Propertius
(iii. 11. 41) represents Caesar's fleet only
by the Liburnian part of it :—

“ Ausa (Cleopatra dated) J ovi nostro la-
trantem opponere Anubim
Baridos et contis rostra Liburna sequi‚”

 

where he speaks contemptuously of her
fleet for his own purpose, but all writers on

the battle of Aetium describe the ships of
M. Antonius and Cleopatra as of cnon-mous
size.. Like those of Caesar, the Egyptian
vessels were fitted with towers (‘propug-
nacula ’)‚ from which the men fought.

4· Sabim—tuo] ‘Tui’ to agree with
‘ Caesaris: 1133 been suggested. ‘ Tuo peri-
culo,' ‘ meo,’ ‘ suo,' ‘ nostro,’ are all 0118 33
common 35 the other, and without the pos-
sessive pronoun ‘ periculum’ is used in the
ablative case in ‘summo periculo,' ‘ minimo
periculo,’ δια, where the ablative is 311 31)-
lative of eost, and is not to be explained by
supplying ‘cum.' Whether a note of in-
terrogation should be put after ‘tuo ’ is 3
matter of taste. Bentley thinks it more
pathetic. It appears to me less simple and
manly. [‘ Periculum subire,’ is like ‘onus
subiit‚’ S. i. 9. 21.—‘ Quid nos :’ the omis-
sion of the verb is common in such forms.]

5. sit superstite] The old Venetian edi-
tion of 1483, and all the editions after that
till Bentley’s that 1 have seen, have ‘sit.’
But the Scholiast Porphyrion read ‘si‚’
saying “ bis posuit particulam ‘si 3' semel·
abundat.’' Torrentius, reading ‘sit‚’ notices
the reading ‘ si' in one of his MSS„ which
has a note in the margin, “si abundat.''
Another MS. has ‘sic.’ Bentley mentions
six MSS. which have ‘si‚’ and Orelli eleven
more. Two of Orelli’s best, and others
referred to by Bentley, have 110 word be·
tween ‘vita’ and ‘superstite,’ which ap·

MSS. therefore are directly or indirectly
