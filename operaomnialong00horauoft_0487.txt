Qui partum ? Non in caro nidore voluptas

Summa, sed in te ipso est. Tu pulmentaria quaere

Sudando ; pinguem vitiis albumque neque ostrea
Nec scarus aut poterit peregrim juvare lagois,
Vix tamen eripiam posito pavone velis quin

Hoc potius quam gallina tergere palatum,

Corruptus vanis rerum, quia veneat auro

Rara avis et pieta pandat spectacula eauda3
Tamquam ad rem attineat quidquam. Num vesceris ista

Quam laudas pluma ⁴?

Carne tamen quamvis distat nil, hae magis illam
