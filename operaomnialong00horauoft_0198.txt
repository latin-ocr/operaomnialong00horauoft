162 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Weep not, Asterie3 Gyges is faithful and will return with the spring a rich man. He
has been driven to Oricum and is weeping with impatience for thee. Chloe, his
hostes& is trying to seduce him, and frightens him with stoi-ies of rejected women’s
revenge. But he is deaf to her seductions. Beware in thy turn of Enipeus, thy
gallant neighbour. Shut thy doors and listen not to his songs.

QUID fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
Primo restituent vere Favonii
Thyna merce beatum,
Constantis juvenem fide,
Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum 5
Post insana Caprae sidera frig-idas
Noctes non sine multis
Insomnis lacrimis agit.
Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,
Suspirare Chloen et miseram tuis
Dicens ignibus uri,
Tentat mille vafer modis.
Ut Proetum mulier perfida credulum
Falsis impulerit criminibus nimis
Casto Bellerophonti
Maturare necem refert.

2. Favonii] See C. i. 4.1. Favonius, same in Horace, and Bithy nien traffic is
according to Pliny (ii. c. 47), blew‘ ab oc· rich merchandize (Epp. i. Gy. 33).

vessel coming down the Adriatic, and not
very unfavourable for sailing up the west
coast of Italy. It would bein her teeth as
she tried to make the straits of Messina.
But Horace’s winds are not more studied
than his places and persons. The lover is
waiting till the weather changes and the
winds are mild and favoni-able. The Favonii
are called‘ candidi' as Notus and Iapyx
are each called‘albus’ (C. i. 7.15; iii. 27·
31«. fide] According to Aulus Gellius,
who has devoted a ‹chapter to the subject
(ix. 14), the older forms of genitives of
this declensidn were four,‘ es, ' ‘ei, ' ‘i, ¹ and
‘e.’ Most of the MSS. have‘ fidei? one of
Bentley' s ‘fidi‚' a few‘ fide? which‘ ιε gene-
rally adopted now. [Keller and Ritter
have‘ fidei. '‘] ‘Muneralaetitiamque dii”
is Heyne’ s reading of Aen. i. 636. But· m
Georg. i. 208 he reads ‘die' for the geni-
tive. See Heyne’s and Wagner's obser-
vations on those passages [and Coning-
ton s]. The Th3ui aud Bithyni are the

5. Oricum] Or Oricus was a town in
EpiruS, situated at the top of the bay
formed by the Acroceraunium promon-
tory. The constellation of the great Amal-
thea rises at the beginning of October.

13. mulier perfida] Antea or Stheno-
baea (Iliad. vi. 155 sq.). Some writers
make Astydamia, others Hippolyte, the
wife of Acastus, who, out of revenge for
his rejection of her, induced her hus·
band to expose Peleus to destruction.
J osephfs virtue has its parallels in Greeian
fable. Juvenal refers to the women, and
adds (S. x. 328) ε

“ —Mulier saevissima tunc est
Cum stimulos odio pudor admovetl?

On ‘ tentat ’ (v. 12) see note on C. iii. 4. 71.

‘Ignibus’ is used'as Ovid uses it (Am. iii.
9. 56), “vixisti dum tuus ignis eram.’' We
may understand ‘ ignibus‚' C. i. 27. 16, in
the same way, i. e. the flame put for the
person who causes it. ‘ Impello’ is used
with the infinitive mood by TacItus (Anu.
xiv. 60). The common construction is
with ‘ ut,’>as in Epp. ii. 2. 51. ’
