55. Marsaeus, amator Originis] Origo,
the mima, is referred to above (v. 2 n.).
Of Marsaeus, her lover, we know nothing
even from the Scholiasta. As Estre ob-
serves, the name is not Latin.
⁴ [60. Personam] ‘A woman of a par-

ticular class,’ here a ‘matrona,' as it is
generally explained. L. Doederlein has
suggested that Horace means ‘personam
moechi ι’ “is it enough for you to avoid
the reputation (character) of an adulterer,
διο. Ρ” and this, I think, is the meaning.
‘ Persona ’ is the legal ‘character‚’ ‘office,’
‘ condition’ of a person in a community.
‘J us personarum,' one of the divisions of
law (Gaius, i. 89), is that part of law which
relates to the condition of persons as ob-
jects of the rules of law, as husband, wife,
child, and so on.]

62. oblimare] Forcellini derives this
from ‘lima‚' and renders it to waste or
wear away. [Doederlein maintains that
this is the sense of ‘oblimare' Comp.
Epp. i. 14. 37, which he quotes ‘ commoda
quisquam oblimat? ‘ To bury in mud’ is
not a satisfactory explanation of ‘obli-
mare' herm] ‘Ubicunque' means
¹ wherever you do it?

63. ancilla, peccesne togata] While
women of birth wore the ‘stola’ and
‘instita’ (v. 29), freedwomen wore the
‘stola' without the ‘institass and ‘mere-
trices’ wore a ‘toga’ instead of a ‘ stola, '
which explains the text. ‘Ancilla’ is a
female slave, and I do not think Orelli is
right in taking it with ‘togata' There
are three persona, the ‘matrona‚’ the ‘ an-
cilla‚’ and the ‘togata’ or ‘mereti-ix?
Cruquius’ Scholiast says that ladies di-
vorced for adultery were compelled to ex-

change the ‘ stola ' for the ‘ toga‚’ the only
difference between them and common
prostitutes being that they wore a white,
while the latter wore a dark-coloured
‘toga’ This is confirmed by v. 36, and
Martialz—

“ Coccina famosae donas et ianthina
moechae.
Vis dare quae meruit munera Ρ mitte
togam ’³ (ii. 39).

Also “ matrisque togatae filius” (Mart. vi.
64. 4). See Becker-'s Gallus (l. c. on v.
29). [‘ Ancilla peccesve togata τ’ Ritter.
There appears to be little authority for
‘peccesne' He says ‘distinguendi parti-
cula a nomine suo ad verbum trajecta esse
videtur :' cf. Serm. ii. 3. 180, ‘utel-aedilis
fueritve vestrum praetore]

64. Villius in Fausta Sullae ρεπεν]
The preposition is here used as in Tacitus
(Ann. iii. 24), “ D. Silanus in nepti Au-
gusti adulter.'’ Fausta was the daughter
of the dictator Sulla, and a woman of in-
famous character, like her mother Metella
(S. ii. 3. 239 ιι.). The husband of Fausta
was Annius Milo, and the Scholiast Acron
says that Villius is put for Annius, as Mal-
thinus for Maecenas (see above, v. 25),
Licinia for Terentia (see C. ii. 12, Iun-o·
duction). But, as Bentley rightly ob-
serves, Horace is not speaking of husbands
here. He adds also, thatif any name were
to be supposed concealed under Villius, it
would be Fulvius, for Macrobius (Sat. ii.
2) relates that Fausta had a lover 'of that
name. Cicero (Ad Fam. ii. 6) speaks of
one Villius, an intimate friend of Milo.
Horace calls him ironically Sulla’s son-in·
law, because of his intimacy with his
