1 02 HORATII FLACCI

’ ARGUMENT.

Barim, if I could see thee punished for thy false vows, I might believe thee again.
But the moment after thou hant forsworn thyself thou art lovelier and more bright
than ever. Perjury then is profitable, Venus and her train laugh at it. Fresh slaves
follow thee, and the old ones cannot leave thy roof ς mothers and stingy fathers and

new-married brides are afraid of thee.

ULLA si juris tibi pejerati
Poena, Barine, nocuisset unquam,
Dente si nigro fieres vel uno ,
Turpior ungui,
Crederem. Sed tu simul obligasti 5
Perfidum votis caput enitescis
Pulchrior multo, juvenumque prodis
Publica cura.
Expedit matris cineres opertos
Fallere et toto taciturna noctis 10
Signa cum caelo gelidaque divos
Morte carentes.
Ridet hoc inquam Venus ipsa, rident
Simplices Nymphae,'ferus et Cupido
Semper ardentes acuens sagittas 15
Cote cruenta.
Adde quod pubes tibi crescit omnis,
Servitus crescit nova, nec priores

1. juris—pejerati] This expression is not
found elsewhere. [t is formed by analogy
⁴from ‘jus jurandum? Acron speaks of a
form ‘jus juratum‚’ but that too is not
found in extant writings. Ovid has imi-
tated the opening of this ode (Amor. iii. 3.

1 sq. :—
“ Esge deos, i, crede : fidem jurata fefellit,
Et facies illi quae fuit ante manet,” &ca

Theocritus mentions a pimple on the tip
of the tongue or the nose as a punishment
for lying (Idyll. ix. 30)—
μηκεῖῑ ἐπὶ ’γλώσσας ἄκρας ὀλοφύγδονα
(xg- ΖΞ) ,ἐγὼ δέ σε τὸν namra αἰνέων
ψεύδεα ῥινὸς ὕπερθεν ἆραιῆς οὐκ ἂνα-

«pam.

9. opertos] I do not find that this word
is used elsewhere for ‘sepultos.’ There
was no *more common cath than by the
ashes of the dead, and the moon and stars.
Orelli has collected instances to which

many others might be added, ae Ovid,
Heroid. iii. 103 ; viii. 119.

13. Ridet hoc inquam Venus ipsa
Tibullus (or the author of the third boo
attributed to him) says the same of Jove
(iii. 6. 49) :

 

“ perjuria ridet amantum
J uppiter et ventos irrita fene jubet?

Stephens in his Thesaurus (vol. ii. p. 95)
mentions two Greek proverbe to the same
effect : ἀφροδίσιος ὅρκος οὔκ ἐμτοίνιμος,
and τὸν ’γὰρ ’γυναικὸς ὅρκον εἷς ὕδωρ γράφω,
which is probably a verse stom a Greek
dmmatist.

[14. Simplices] Comp. ‘simplex mundi-
tiis,’ C. 1. 5. ‘Simplex’ is ‘innocent,’ 'art-
less,' or at least that which has the uppem-⁴
auce of being so. It is opposed to ‘ ferus?

15. Semper ardentes] This may
taken from a picture. Moschus (Id. i. 29)
says of the weapons of love, πυρὶ πάντα
βέβαπται. ⁴ Scmper' belongs to ‘arden-
tes)
