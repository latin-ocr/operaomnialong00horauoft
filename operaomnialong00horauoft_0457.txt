tions, put a note of interrogation aster
‘vr-em? But see Key ’.sL G.‚ §1423‚ b,
and the example there quoted from Cicero:
—“ Quaero eum Brutine similem malis an
Antoni.'’ ‘Res' is technically used here
and elsewhere (in legal formulae) as an
equivalent for ‘lis.' It need not be con-
siden-ed unnatural that the intrusive fellow
should hesitate between losing his cause
and leaving the man he was tormenting.
He had an object to gain which, if he could
secure it, would (he might consider) be
more than a compensation for the loss of
the suit, and he was pretty sure Horace
would never give him such an opportunity
again.

good character does not appear. The Scho-
110010, and all editions before Bentley have
that word, which, as Orelli says, may have
out of the text from having been
united with ‘durum‚' thus ‘dm-umet. ² The
example Bentley quotes from Terence
(Pborm. ii. 1. 8),‘ ‘Etiam idne lex coegit?
Illud durum. Ego expediam. sine,' is
nothing to the purpose. This· 10 a narra-
tive, and a very different 0000, 00 any one

mistaken, we should soon push aside
your rivalsfl' Other interpretations have
been given, and the sentences differently
divided. ‘Paucorum hominum’ has the
same meaning as in Terence (Eun. 1ii. 1.
) Immo sic homo est ς
Perpaucorum hominum. Gn. Immo nul-
lorum arbitror
Si tecum vivitss’

[Ιι may also mean ‘a rare kind of man,'
as‘ unus multorum‚' v. 71, means‘ a com-
mon sort of man; ’and this· 10 perhaps the
better interpretation. ] F erre secundas’
and ‘jad utor' are scenic ιρι-1110, and are

other of all the subordinate players. ‘Hunc

dere ' is a conventional term for introduc-
tions‚ and ‘ submovere ’ for the dutyof tho
lictor in clear-ing the way (C. ii. 16. 10).
[¹ Submosses: ·’ this tense signifies, as Doe-
derlein observes,t you would have removed
all your rivals out of the way, 11· you had
only introduced me. ’]
