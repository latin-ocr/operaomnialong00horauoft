Ergo non satis est risu diducere rictum

When Schlegel therefore Drama, Lect.

&tw inferencoe from this fact advene to
his own judgment, they appear to me 10
nist-ke the meaning of this passage. He

mends is that of the orator sternly or
gnvely rebuking vice, of the humorous
ntinst ) broadly ridiculing it, and
ofthe polished wit who, instead of throw·
ing himselfwith all his upon his
victim, substitutas sareasm for invective,
and lstshis power be rather felt than seen.

Auditoris, et est quaedam tamen hic quoque virtus.
Fst brevitate opus, ut currat sententia neu se
Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures;

Et sermone opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso,
Defendente vicem modo rhetoris atque poetae,
Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus atque

of these three the gravity of 810111 reproof
Horace estimates lowest, saying that ridi-
cule generally settles questions of however
grave importance better and more deci-
sively than severity. ‘Seeare' is used in
thesenseof‘ decidere’ in Epp. i. 16. 42:
“Quo multae aeque secantur judice
11108.” Cicero (de'Or. ii. 58) says‚‘ ‘Est
plane oratoris movere risum-maxime
quod tristitiam ao severitatem mitigat et
relaxat odiosasque res saepe quas argu-
mentis dilui non facile est joco risuque

dissolvit?

‘Simius iste' is said by the Scholiasts, with
every probability, to 1110811 Demetrius,
whom we meet with below (v. ’19) as an
abnser of Horace and (v. 90) 88 8 trainer
of ’11111118οξ like Hermogenes with whom
he is associated. The Scholiasts say he
was called an spe because of the shortness
of his stature and the deformity of his
person. It may be doubted whether that
idea was not derived from Aristophanes'
description of Cleigenae, Rau. 708, ὁ τι 'on-
κός γ’ οὗτος Κλειγένης δμικρός. His only
skill was to sing the love songs of Calvus
and Catullus (and to imitate them, Acron
adds, probably at 8 guess). Horace hav-
ing mentioned the great masters of Greek
comedJ', cannot help stepping out of his
way toy aim a blow at these pitiful persons,
Hermogenes and his ape.1t has been
rightly observed that Horace does not
mean 10 disparage the two favourite poeta
and sworn friends, Calvus and Catullus,
but merely to show that it requireda more
