HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE IX.
A.U.C. 734.

As to Septimius, on whose behalf this Epistle is addressed to Tiberius, see C. ii. 6,
Introduction. The occasion was that journey into Armenia which has been referred
to twice before (Ep. 3 and 7). It is a well-considered and careful productiori. Horace
would have written more warmly for such an intimate friend if he could have ventured
to do so; but the character of Tiberius did not admit of warmth, and he would not
have responded to any very earnest eulogy. Horace therefore satisfies himself with
merely naming his friend and excusing his own boldness in doing so.

This Epistle is noticed in au amusing article of the Spectator (No. 493) on the
subject of introductione and testimonials in general, of which this is quoted as a
judicious specimen, and a loose translation is there given.

SEPTIMIUS, Claudi, nimirum intelligit unus

Quanti me facias, nam cum rogat et prece cogit

Scilicet ut tibi se laudare et tradere coner,

Dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis,

Munere cum fungi propioris censet amici, 5
Quid possim videt ac novit me valdius ipso.

Multa quidem dixi cur excusatus abirem ;

1. nimirum] ‘ of course,’ it would be
strange if it were otherwise. Horace some-
times uses the word seriously, sometimes
ironically, as in S. ii. 2. 106 3 3. 120. He
says ‘ Of course Septimius knows my influ-
ence with you better than any body else
does (‘ unus,' see S. ii. 6. 57, n.), and better
than I do myself, and thinks that I stand
to you in the relation of an intimate friend,
or he would not press me for an introduc-
tion.’ There is about the same amount
of ironical meaning in ‘ scilicet-³ [‘ Nimi-
rum ' is another form of ‘mirum ni.’]
‘ Tradere' is the usual word for introduc-
tions. (S. i. 9. 47.) ‘Munere fungi’ is
like ‘officium facio ' below (Epp. 17. 21).
It means to discharge the duties of friend-
ship, but generally expresses the relation
of an inferior to one above him in rank,
and sometimes is used in a bad sense to
signify servility.

4. Diynwm mente domoque] Tacitus
says of Tiberius (Ann. vi. 51) z “ Morum
quoquc tempora illi diversa ε egregium
vita famaque, quoad privatus vel in imperiis
sub Augusto fuit: occultum ac subdolum

fingendis virtutibus, donec Germanicus ac '
Drusus superfuere.’' His genuine char
racter, he says, did not come out fully till
after the fall of Sejanus. But even now
he was so reserved and unpleasant in his
manners that Angustus could hardly be
cheerful in his company. Suetonius thinks
Augustus had no very good opinion of him:
“ sed vitiis virtutibusque perpensis potiores
duxisse vi rtutes'’(Tib. e. 21). Horace speaks
well of him not only here, when he is
writing to himself, but in Epp. ii. 2. 1,
written probably at a later time, to his
friend Julius Florus. The fourteenth Ode
of the fourth book was written in honour
of his success, but there 1 think no great
amount of warmth is shown in his favour.
‘ Domo ' means his family. Tiberius was
the son os T. Claudius Nero and Livia,
who was now the wife of Augustus. The
Nerones belonged to the great petrician
gens Claudia. They were of Sabine origin.

6. valdius] This comparative occurs
again in A. P. 321. [‘ Cur ' (Ep. 8. 10) is
equivalent to ‘ propter quae.’]
