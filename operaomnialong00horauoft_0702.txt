Fabula si dubitem, clament periisse pudorem

HORATII FLACCI

80

Cuncti paene patres, ea cum reprehendere coner
Quae gravis Aesopus, quae doctus Roscius egit:
Vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducunt,
Vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus, et quae

Imberbes didicere senes perdenda fateri.

J am Saliare Numae carmen qui laudat, et illud
Quod mecum ignorat solus vult scire videri,

this play which Horace alludes to, all the
Scholiasts say was Matertera3 and in re-
spect to ‘crocum floresque perambulet?
Comm. Cruq. says, ‘i. e. in scenam re-
cepta sit quae floribus et croco spargitur?
Itis not clear that Horace had any parti-
cular play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta's to have flowers
scattered on the stage, on which it was
usual to sprinkle a perfume extracted from
the crocus. Propert. (iv. 1. 15) :—

“ Nec sinuosa cavo pendebant vela theatro ;
Pulpita sollennes non oluere crocos,”

which verses are repeated almost word for
*word by Ovid (A. A. i. 103). This is what
Martial alludes to in “Lubrica Corycio
quamvis sint pulpita nimbo’' (ix. 39) [‚ and
Lucretius, ii. 416]. The perfume was
mixed with water and thrown up through
pipes, so as to sprinkle not only the stage,
but the spect-ators. The most famous
crocus was that of Mount Corycus in Cili-
cia (S. ii. 4. 68 n.).

[81. canati—patres] Ritter supposes
the ‘ patres’ to be the senators. I think
with Kriiger that Horace means the older
people (v. 85. Comp. v. 109).]

82. Quae yravis Aesopus] Claudius
Aesopus, the tragic actor, was an intimate
friend of Cicero and most of the distin-
guished meu of that time. He was older
than Cicero, but the date of his birth or
death is not known. He was a freedman
of some person belonging to the Clodia
gens. Speaking of enunciation Quintilian
applies the same epithet to Aesopus that
Horace does: “Plus autem affectus ha-
bent lentiora: ideoque Roscius citatior,
Aesopus gravior fuit, quod ille comoedias,
hic tragoedias egit ’' (xi. 3. 111). Cicero
makes Quintus compare Aesopus’ delivery
with his own, and speaks of him as show-
ing “ tantum ardorem vultuum atque mo-
tuum ut eum vis quaedam abstraxisse a
sensu mentis videretur '’ (de Div. i. 37).

‘Gravis' is a good epithet for a tragic actor.

— quae doctus Roscius egit] Q. Ros-

cius, the comic actor, was also an intimate

friend of Cicero, who osten speaks of him,
and pleaded for him iu a speech still in
part extant. Cicero speaks of “ Roscii
gestus et venustas '’ (de Orat. i. 59), and
illustrates the description of Quintilian
given above, ‘Roscius citatior? by saying
(de Legg. i. 4) that when he was growing
old‚‘ ‘numeros in cantu ceciderat lpsasque
tardiores fecit tibias. ” His enunciation
was rapid when he was young, but he was
obliged to slacken it in his old age. The

the accurate knowledge he acquired of the
principles of his art. He died about A.U.o.
692, and was enormously rich, like Aesopus
(S. ii. 3. 239 n.).

86. Jam Saliare Numae commen] The
Salii consisted of two colleges of twelve
priests each ; one said to have been esta-
blished by Numa on the Palatine hill to
attend on Mars Gradivusg the other by
Tullus Hostilius on the Quirinal for the
service of Quirinus. The first were espe-
cially appointed to preserve the ancilia or
shields of Mars which at his festival at the
beginning of March every year they car-
ried in procession: ‘⁴ Canentes carmina
cum tripudiis sollemnique saltatu ” (Liv.
i. 20. See O. iv. 1. 28 n.). These hymns
were in honour of Mars (as seems proba·
ble), under the name Mamurius Veturius.
The other gods were also celebrated. The
hymns were called by the name ‘axamenta‚’
of which the etymology is unknown. Their

“Saliorum carmina vix sacerdotibus suis
satis intellecta'’ (i. 6. 40). But there ap-
pear to have been those who thought them-
selves elever enough to make them out,
which Horace doubts, -It may be that
popular belief attributed the composition
of these verses to Numa, though that need
not be inferred from what Horace says.
Virgil gives the name of Salii to the priests
of Hercules (Aen. viii. 285), and describes
their hymns in terms apparently drawn
from the Salii of Mars.
