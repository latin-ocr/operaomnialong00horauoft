440 HORATII FLACCI

Aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi? 15
“ Attamen et justum poteras et scribere fortem,
Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius.” “ Haud mihi deero

Cum res ipsa feret.

Nisi dextro tempore Flacci

Verba per attentam non ibunt Caesaris aurem,

Cui male si palpere recalgitrat undique tutus.”

Aah, 20

“ Quanto rectius hoc quam tristi laedere versu

Pantolabum scurram Nomentanumque nepotem,

Cum sibi quisque timet, quamquam est intactus, et odit l ’²

“ Quid faciam? Saltat Milonius, ut semel icto

Accessit fervor capiti numerusque lucernis. 25
Castor gaudet equis, ovo prognatus eodem

Pugnis 3 quot sopitam vivunt, totidem studiorum
Milia: me pedibus delectat claudere verba

bentis equo‚’ see C. i. 2. 39 n.
scribat :' ‘ describit,' Ritter.]

16. poteras] See v. 7. As to ‘fortem,’

see what is said of ‘Fortitudo' on C. S.
v. 57.
- 17. Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius]
Virgil uses this form (Georg. ii. 170), ‘⁶ Sci-
piadas duros bello'' [and Lucretius, iii.
1034] As the Elder Scipio had Ennius
to praise him (C. iv. 8), so the younger
had Lucilius, who was his intimate friend,
and who served under him in the Numan-
tine VVar. ‘Sapiens' is applied to the
poet as ‘doctus’ is elsewhere. See note
on C. i. 1. 29.

18. dextro tempore] 866 S. ii. 4. 4:
“ cum te sic tempore laevo Interpellarim.”
[‘ Res feret,’ ‘when opportunity shall
offer :' ‘ dumque aetas tulit,' Ter. Andr. ii.

22.]Pantolabum] S. i. 8. 11.

24. Milonius] When the Scholiasts
know nothing about a man of this sort
they usually call him 3 ‘scurra,' a para-
site, 3 low fellow who has no respect for
himself, who lets himself out at the price
of a dinner to entertain rich people and
their guests with buffoonery and small
talk. This man, as soon as the wine is
in his head, would get up and dance be-
fore the company, the lowest proceeding
in the eyes of a Roman that could be ima-
gined. Cicero (pro Mur. c. 6) says it is
wrong in Cato to call a Roman consul a
‘dancer :³ “ Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi
sorte insanit,” and ne calls it “omnium
vitiorum postremum.'' ‘ Icto: in this
sense of ‘wine-struck,’ is expressive, but
does not occur elsewhere. It is -a Greek

[‘ De·

notion. Juvenal graphically describes the
effect of tipsiness in doubling the candles
apid gffigffing every thing out of its place
ἓ Cum bibitur concha, cum jam vertigine
Amhciisstissft geminis exsurgit mensa lu-
cernis.

26. Castor gaudet equis] This differ-
61166111 the tastes of Castor aud his brother
is expressed in one line of the Iliad (iii.
237), Κάστορά θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν
Πολυδεύκεα. 011 what follows the Scho-
liasts quote the well-known sentence of
Terence, “ Quot homines tot sententiae ς
suus cuique mos ’' (Phormio, ii. 4. 14).

28. claudere] 866 S. i. 10. 59. Out of
the common compliment in the next line,
with which Rutgersius (Lect. Ven. p. 362)
compares Lucretius (iii. 1025) :—

“ Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus Ancu' re—
liquit,

Qui melior multis quam tu fuit, improbe,
rebus,’

the Scholiasts have extracted an allusion
to Lucilius’ ancestral connexion with Cn.
Pompeius Magnus, whose great uncle 116
is said to have been. 'she description of
Lucilius' affection for his books, his com-
panions in cheerfulness and 111 sorrow, to
whom he communicated as to sympa-
thizing friends his most secret thoughts,
and through whom his whole inner life
was laid open to the world, is graceful and
touching. It must have satisfied any
reasonable person who had been disposed
to qum-rel with Horace for his remarks on
the old poets.
