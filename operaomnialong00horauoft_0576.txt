HORATII FLACCI

Si memini Varius ,- cum Servilio Balatrone
Vibidius, quas Maecenas adduxerat umbras.
Nomentanus erat super ipsum, Porcius infra
Ridiculus totas semel obsorbere placentas;

Nomentanus ad hoc, qui si quid forte lateret

25

Indice monstraret digito: nam cetera turba,
Nos, inquam, coenamus aves, conchylia, pisceS,
Longe dissimilem noto celantia succum ς

Ut vel continuo patuit, cum passeris atque

Ingustata mihi porrexerat ilia rhombi.

their places were usually occupied by de-
pendents of the host (parasites), who filled
up the table, and helped to flatter the
host and entertain the company. This
explains Epp. i. 18. 10, “imi Derisor
lecti.’' Sometimes these places were oc-
cupied by ‘ umbrae‚’ brought by the in-
vited guests See Becker's Gall. exc. ‘ Tri-
clinium.' By ‘summus ego' Fundanius
means that he occupied the farthest seat
on the ‘summus lectus? The slaves in
helping the wine began from this point,
and went round till they came to the
‘ imus,’ or third place in the ‘imus lectus.'
See Plautus (Asin. v. 2. 41), “ Da, puere,
ab summo. Age tu interibi ab infimo da
savium.'' These words Demaenetus ad-
dresses to his wife, who, as above stated,
would, according to custom, be where he
says, ‘ ab infimo,' ‘ ima?

— Viscus Thurinus] See S. i. 9. 22 n.;
10. 83 n. He appears to have been a na-
tive of Thurii, in Lucania. which was made
a Latin colony amno. 559 (Livy, xxxv. 9),
and received the name of Copiae. But the
old name, given it at the foundation by the
Athenians (B.c. 443), continued to be used
as well as the new. [As Viscus is named,
Thurinus, Orelli and others suppose that
he is not one of the Visci mentioned in
S. i. 10. 83.] As to Varius, see S. i. 5. 40
n. Nothing is known of Servilius Balatro
(as to whose cognomen, see S. 2. 2 n.) or
Vibidius. The second syllable of Servilius
on coins is long3 the third therefore co-
alesces with the last. Maecenas had taken
them with him as ‘ umbrae‚' which means
persons taken by guests without special
invitation from the host. (Epp. i. 5. 28
n.) The MSS. and editions vary between
‘ quos' and ⁴ quas! Orelli prefers ‘ quas.'
‘ Super ipsum’ means on the seat above
the host (see last note). As to Nomen-
tanus, see S. i. 1. 102. Porcius, Comm.
Cruq. says, was a ‘publicanus,’ which is

30

not worth much. Porcius seems to be
occupied chiefly in filling his own belly,
while the host and his other parasite are
looking after the guests and doing the
honours of the table. ‘Placentae' were
eakes, often sweetened with honey. [Rit-
ter has ‘ simul absorbere? There is au-
thority both for ‘simul’ and ‘ semel?
Doederlein thinks that ‘simul' expresses
something beyond the bounds of proba-
bility; but the man swallowed several
cakes‚ one at a time, as Ritter says.]

25. Nomentanus ad hoc, qui] ‘Nomen-
tanus was there for this purpose that he
might —.' His business was that of no-
menclator, to direct the attention of the
guests to any dainties they might have
overlooked, and to explain to them the
mystery of each dish3 for, as Fundanius
sayS, the commonest viands were so
dressed up with sauces, that they could
hardly be recognized, or new sorte of
dishes were put on the table, such as the
viscera of different fish‚ turbot and plaice
for instance. ‘ Passer’ is described by
Pliny (N. H. ix. 20) as a flat fish, and is
generally supposed to be the plaice. ‘ In-
dice digito' is the forefinger: the middle
finger was called ‘famosus.' Persius calls
it ‘ infamis’ (S. ii. 33), and Martial ‘ impu-
dicus' (vi. 70. 5). This name is given to
it as the finger of scorn. The third finger
was called ‘medicus ' or ‘ medicinalis‚’ for
the same reason probably that it had the
name ‘ annularis: its supposed anatomical
connexion with the beart. (See S. 7. 9.)
By ‘cetera turba' Fundanius means the
uninitiated, Maecenas and his party. ‘ Ut
vel continuo patuit ' means that the nature
and importance of Nomentanus’ fonctions
were shown ou that occasion, when he
handed Fundanius a ‹lainty he had never
tasted before, and yet these gentlemenr
knew what good living was.
