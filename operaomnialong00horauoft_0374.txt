so far back as the age of the Scholiasts to
get at least as good guesses at the meaning
as these. Festus derives the name from
‘ blatea,' which he says signifies mud that
sticks to the shoes in dirty weather. There
are no means of arriving at a nearer inter-
pretation than that of the Scholiasts, who
say Horace means profligate persons in
general. See S. ii. 3, 166 n.

6. propellere] The greater part of the
MSS. favour this reading, as Bentley ad-
mits, though he reads ‘ depellere? I think
‘ propellere ’ is the least likely of the two
to have been substituted. Cicero (de Fini-
bus, iv. 25) says, “ Vacemus an cruciemur
dolore 3 frigus famem propulsare possimus ;''
and Tacitus (Ann. xiv. 24) z “ Carne pecu-
dum propulsare famem adacti‚'’ which
comes very near to ‘ propellere‚' as Bentley
admits· Ven. (1483) has ‘propellere'
Nearly all the editions of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centurias have the other word.
There is not much to choose between
them.

8. ingrata strinyat malua inyluvie rem]
“ Ingrata : sine gratia ε quia quicquid ei
praestiteris gratiam tibi habere non potest.
Ingluvies autem dicitur voracitas gulae. ”
(Acron.) An ungrateful belly is an insatia-
ble one. So Lucretius uses the word (iii.

“Deinde animi ing-ratam naturam pascere
Atngssssiere bonis rebus satiareque nun-
quam.”

Forcellini says ‘stringere’ here is ‘paullatim
absumere-³ Orelli adopts the interpreta-
tion of Cruquius' Scholiast‚ who says the
metaphor is taken from the stripping of
trees of their leaves. But ‘stringere'
means ‘to grasp,’ and Horace says this

man put all his estate in his belly.

9. conductis—numanis] This is not a
common use of ‘conductus,' for ‘foenori
sumptus? Juvenal has it (S. xi. 46):
“ Conducta pecunia Romae Et coram do-
minis consumitur.’' The opposite term to
‘ conducere‚’ ‘ locare‚’ is only once found in
this connexion (Plaut. Mostell. iii. 1. 4) ε
“locare argenti nemini nummum queo.”
‘ Animi parvi' corresponds to ‘inopis pusil-
lique animi’ in S. 4. 17. [Ritter inter-
prets ‘conductis ’ thus, ‘ a variis avi paren-
tisque debitoribus conductum et receptum
argentum? and he adds ‘ nam mutuo pecu-
niam sumere is non cogitur cui praeclaram
rem majores reliquerunt.5 But when the
man had spent his estate, he would borrow
if 116 could.]

12. Fufidius] Of this·person the Scho-
liasts tell us only what the Satire tells,
that he was “avarus quidam foenerator?

‘pVa pa ’and‘ nebulo’ qhave been explained
(. -.14 pQuina-sr hie capiti mercedes exsecat]
He contrived to squeeze ont of the prin-
cipal of the money he lent interest (‘ mer-
cedes’ equivalent to ‘usuras') at 60 per
cent. by the year‚—that is, 5 per cent. by
the mouth, which was five times the legal
rate. ‘Centesima,' or 1 per cent. by the
mouth, was the regular rate of interest at
this time3 and‘ quinas’ means ‘quinas
centesimas? Verres lent public money on
his own account to the‘ publicani' in Sicily

‘binis centesimis: which was double the
usual rute (Cic.' 111 Verr.' 11. 3. 70). Τ111113
was bad enough. Juvenal (ix. ’1) mentions
aman who was ready to give ‘triplicem
usuram, 'but found no one foolish enough
to trust him. Fufidius contrived to guget
this enormous interest (‘ sanguinolentae
centesimae? as Seneca say& Benef. vii. 10)
out of men of loose lives, and young per·
