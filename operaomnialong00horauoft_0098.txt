62 HORATII FLACCI

ι OARMEN XXVIII.

A great deal has been written about this ode, as to the spirit and purport of it, the
occasion of its composition, the persons introduced, and the parts they respectively bear.
The more lite-rally we take the ode and the less we search for hidden meanings, or attempt
to fix the date or the cause that led to the train of thought, the more likely we are, Ι
conceive, to arrive at the true bearing of the ode. Septimius, one of Horace’s most
intimate friends, had a villa at Tarentum (C. ii. 6), where it is likely Horace on some
occasion, if not often, paid him a visit. It seems to me not improbable that he may have
seen a body cast on shore at that place where the scene appears to be laid. The sight of
this body might naturally suggest such an ode as this, in which the spirit of a ship-
wrecked man is introduced moralizing upon death and asking for burial. His reflections
take the form, in the first instance, of an address to Archytas the philosopher, whose ¹
name was associated with Tarentum , and he joins with him other worthies, whose wis:
dom and greatness had not saved them from the common lot of all. There may have
been a legend that Archytas was buried on the ‘litus Matinum,' generally supposed to
be a part of the range of Mons Garganus in Apulia. Possibly a tomb was shown there
that was said to be his. But it does not follow that the speaker was there. Τ110 name
of Archytas would be suggested by his association with Tarentum, where I think (from
v. 29) the scene is laid, and the name of such a man is naturally connected with the
reflections of this ode, even independently of his connexion with the place. That
Archytas was shipwrecked on a voyage down the Hadriatic (which is the general
opinion) has been too hastily assumed from this ode. If he was really buried at the
foot of Mons Garganm, there are other ways of accounting for it. But the fact is
not proved.

The ode has the appearance at first sight of a dialogue, and the great majority of
commentators take it in that way. Though differing from others as to the division of
the dialog-ue, which Ι thought should take place in the middle of the fifteenth verse, I
was once of the same opinion myself. I have now changed that opinion, and believe,
with Hottinger and others, quoted by Orelli in his Excursus, that it is no dialogue
at all, which view Ι am the more disposed to adopt, because it is supported by the
judgment of my friend Mr. Long. Those who hold this opinion are divided in their
interpretation. Casaubon affirmed that the ode was merely the poet’s meditation upon
the fate of Archytas and on the destiny of all great men: followed by an appeal, on
the part of Archytas, for burial (I suppose at v. 21). Lubker and Rezel think Horace’s
ghost is speaking under the fanciful notion that he himself had been drowned off
Palinurus (O. iii. 4. 27). G. Fabricius supposed the shade of Archytas to be speaking
throughout. Hottinger (Opusc. Phil. Lips. 1817) and Weiske (Jahn. Annal. Phil.
1830) held the view that I have adopted, except that they supposed the unfortunate
man, whose body is lying unburied, is speaking at the tomb of Archytas on the pro-
montory of Matinum. I see no occasion for that, and think the subject of the ode is
more likely to have been suggested at Tarentum than any where else. The words
‘Neptuno custode Tarenti’ seems to fix the scene. If Archytas was buried, or sup-
posed to be buried, at Matinum, it would be natural for one who thought of the
nari-ow space to which his greatness was 'reduced to mention the spot where his bones
lay. But 'it does not appear why a person speaking at Matinum should talk of
Neptune particularly as the ‘ custos Tarenti?

Those who consider that the whole ode consists of a dialogue between a sailor and
‘Archytas divide it either after v. 6, or v. 16, or v. 20. They who make the mariner
cease to speak at v. 6, do so chiefly, because the subjects that follow that verse are sup-
posed to be above a speaker of his class. But, as that would be contradicted by Archytas'
appeal to his judgment in v. 14, it has been proposed to alter ‘ te’ into ‘me' or ‘ses
