O SAEPE mecum tempus in ultimum

1. tempus inultimwm] During the two
years between his leaving Rome and the
battle of Philippi, Brutus went through
many hard-fought battles with the native
tribes in Macedonia and in Asia Minor, as
well asin resisting the assumption of his
province by C. Antonius the triumvir’s
brother, to whom the Senatc had assigned
it. ‘Tempus in ultimum' does not mean
80 much to the brink of the grave, as we
should say, as into extreme danger or need.

3. redonavit Quiritem] This word ‘re-
donare ’ is peculiar to Horace. He uses it

Pompeius' pardon, I do not know 011 what
grounds. ‘ Quiritem ’ has particular force
as ⁴ unshorn of your citizenship? He had
not been ‘capite deminutus? The singular
‘Quiris’ does not occur in prose—writers.
Heinsius’ conjecture ‘ Quiritum ' is weak
and insipid.

5. prime sodalium] It is probable that
the days Horace enjoyed so much with his
friend were spent at Athens. The lan-
guage does not seem to 81111 8 camp-life on
such a service as the army of Brutus went

8. Μαῑοόαέῖννο] Graevius says that
Malobathrum came from the Malabar
coast, and that its native name was Tama-
lobatra. It must in that case have been
of the betel tribe. But the betel has no
amen, nor is any 011 extr-acted from it. If

this be an Indian plant, ‘Syrio’ 18 only
used 111 1118 881118 extended application in
which Ovid uses ‘Assyrium’ (Amor. ii. 5.
40): “Maeonis Assyrium foemina tinxit
ebur.” See C. 11. 11. 16. ffliny, RN. xii.
59 (26). ‘dat et malobathron Syria, ar-
borem folio convoluto, arido colore, ex quo
exprimitur oleum ad unguenta! Ritter]

9. Philippos et celerem fuyaan] We
need not take Horace too much at 1118
word. He was not born for a soldier any
more than his friend Iccius (C. i. 29) ς and
he could afford to create a laugh against
himself as a ῥίψασπις. He had in mind
the missortune that befell Alcaeus, as re·
lated by Herodotus (v. 95). Orelli inter-
prets thus :—“ Τ118 boldest amongst us
bowed their heads to the ground which
their shame had disgraced, to ask for
quarter,” as Caesar describes Pompey's
soldiers doing aster the battle of Pharsalia
(B. C. iii. 98). Lambinus [correetly] 1111-
der-stands Horace to mean that they bit
the dust, 88 Turnus says of Mezentius
(Aen. xi. 418): “Procubuit moriens et
humum semel ore momordit‚'' and Ag. in
his prayer against Hector (11. ii. 417)=
