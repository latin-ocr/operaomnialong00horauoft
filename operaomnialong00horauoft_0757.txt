Aeschylus et modicis instravit pulpita tignis

Et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurno.

Successit vetus his comoedia, non sine multa

Laude ς

sed in vitium libertas excidit et vim

Dignam lege regi3 lex est accepta chorusque
Turpiter obticuit sublato jure nocendi.

Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae,

Nec minimum meruere decus vestigia Graeca
’ Ausi deserere et celebrare domestica facta,

⁵ Vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas.
Nec virtute foret clarisve potentius armis

Quam lingua Latium, si non offenderet unum
Quemque poetarum limae labor et mora.

Vos, o

Pompilius sanguis; carmen reprehendite quod non
Multa dies et multa litura coercuit atque
Perfectum decies non castigavit ad unguem.

may have made improvements‘ ιιι what is
called among us the property of a theatre,
but there' rs no reason to suppose that he
invented any of the above things. ‘Mag-
num loqni' is usually referred to the style

of Aeschylus, his ῥήματα γομφοπαγῆ as

Ι ’ Aristophanes calls them. From the con-

nexiou it seems rather to mean that he
taught the actor how to articulate loudly.
’ There is nothing about style here.

281. Successit vetus lais comoedia]
Horace takes no account of the earliest
form of comedy from which the name is
derived, the song of the revellers (κῶμος)
at the Dionysia3 or of the labours of
Sourion, who as early at least as Thespis,
at Icaria, ι, village in Attica, contended
with ι. comic chorus for a prize. That
which was- before com of jests and
obscenities connected with the worship of
Bacchus had now added to it personal
ribaldry and polit-ical jokes, the former
levelled at the spectatore or against public
men. Between Susarion and the period
of the old comedy there were several dis-
tinguished writers, as Chionides, Magnes,
Ecphantides‚ and others. The earliest
writer of the old comedy was Cratinus.
See S. i. 4. 1 n.

288. Vel qui praetextas] ‘ Fabulae
pneoextae’ or ‘praetextatae' were tra-
gledlises’co'iisnecttogiateizh vginffimsetgffise’s ‘trid
manners. (Epp. ii. 1. 57 sqq.) The Greek

295

tragedies to which ‘praetextae' were
opposed were called by the Romans ‘ cre·
pidatae? ‘ Docere ' is used as the Greeks
used διδάσκειν for exhibiting a play, be-
cause the poet also trained the chorus as
χοροδιδάσκαλος. sse principal writers of
tragedy and comedy are mentioned in the
above Epistle and in the notes. To the
writers of ‘togatae' Acron here adds
Aelius Lamia, Antonius Rufus, Cn. Me-
lissus Pomponius.

295. yInqenium misera] The following
verses to 308 have little connexion, as far
as Ι can see, with what goes before. Thea
question about education and nature in
connexion with poetry is taken up again
at v. 408. We are accustomed to snb-
seribe to the doctrine “poeta nascitur,
ιιοιι fit.'' The ancients were divided on
that point, some assigning more to edu-
cation, others to natural gifts. Cicero,
speaking of Pacuvius, asks, “ Pacuvium
putatis in scribendo leni animo ac remisso
fuisse? Fieri nullo modo potuit. Saepe
enim audivi poetam bonum neminem (id
quod a Democrito et Platone in scriptis
relictum esse dicunt) sine inflammatione
animorum existere posse et sine quodam
