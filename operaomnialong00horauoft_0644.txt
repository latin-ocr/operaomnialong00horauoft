608 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE XII.

A.U.c. 734.

Iccius, to whom this Epistle is addressed, has been mentioned, with all that is known
of him, in the Introduction to C. i. 29, and Pompeius Grosphus in C. 11. 16. It is a
letter of introduction for Grosphus to Iccius, who was employed in managing Agrippa's
estates in Sicily.

It is possible Horace may have had a letter From Iccius in which he wrote something
that gave rise to the reflections with which the Epistle begins; but to affirm from what
Horace here says that Iccius was a miser or a misanthrope, or any thing else but a good
and sensible man, any one who reads the Epistle with the smallest attention must see
is absurd. The Argument will show the spirit of it, aud convince any body that Horace
means nothing but compliments to his friend.

The date is not difficult to make out. lt must have been written shortly after the
success of Agrippa against the Cantabri, who, having been subdued by Augustus iu
A.U.c. 730, afterwards broke out again and were finally conquered and broken by
Agrippa A.U.c. 7 34, in the autumn of which year this Epistle was written. (See aas.)
‘At that time the close of 'Tiberius' expedition to Armenia, and the restoration of the
standards of Crassus would be news just fresh.

AR GUMENT.

Use what you get with discretim, 1ccius, and no man can be better off than you. Be
content. He is not poor who has enough. As long as you have good health the
*riches of kings could add nothing to your happiness. Accustom yourself to simple
fare and you will never leave it off, though you should be turned into gold, whether
it be that money makes ‚no change in our natures, or because, like a wisc man, you
count every thing less than virtue. We may wonder why Democritus should have
neglected his goods to absorb himself 111 1118 studies, when we see how you are able
in the midst of sordid employments to list your thoughts to the skies, and to search
into the springs of nature and to balance rival systems.

But be all this as it may, Ι beg you to receive Pompeius Grosphus, and whatever he
asks let him have, for he will ask nothing that is not right. Such friends are
cheaply purchased.

If you would know what is going on at Rome, the Cantabrian has fallen before the
valour of Agrippa, the Armenian of Tiberius. Phraates has done homage and
accepted the yoke of Caesar. Plenty is showering an abundant harvest upon Italy.
