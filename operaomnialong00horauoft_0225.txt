the Kalends, which was a feast day. (Com—
pare iii. 23. 2, ‘nascente luna.’) The
months of Numa's calendar being lunar,
the association of the new moon with the ⁸
first day of· the mouth remained aster the
calendar was altered. A cup for midnight
does not appear ιο have any other meaning
than an excuse for another toast. “Dice-
tur merita Nox quoque naenia’ ¹(C. iii. 28.
11. ίνίὂιω aut novem Miscentur tyathir]
The ‘cyathus' was a ladle with which the
drink was passed from the mixing bowl to
the drinking cnp. The ladle was of certain
capacity, and twelve ‘cyathi' went to the
sextarius. Horace therefore says in effect,
“let the wine be mixed in the proportion
of three cyathi of wine to nine of water, or
of nine of wine to three of water.'’ He
says also the poet under the inspiration of
the Muses likes the stronger proportion ς
but the Graces (in other words, good breed-
ing and good temper) forbid the wine to be
drunk pure, lest it lead to intoxication and
strife. ‘ Tres supra’ means the three over

the largest proportion of nine, and which,

. if added, would make the drink ‘merum.'

The above is Orelli’s explanation, and it
seems ιο me to be true. He held a dif-
ferent opinion at one time, and his Excur-
sus may be consulted by those who are not
satisfied with the explanation here given.
There were different ways of drinking
healths. One way was to drink as many
cupa as there were letters in the name.
Some interpret this passage as meaning
that the poet drank nine cups to the Muses,
while othersto the Gracae drank only three,
aceo to their number. This ex p-lana
tion Orelli does not give; but Ι like ipt best
aster his own. It requires us to render
ἰι-ω sppra’ ‘above threess which 1 do not
like. ‘Miscentur' means that such is the
usual practice, and there· is no necessity to
change it to ‘miscentor‚ m Bentley has
done,g following Rutgersius. “Commodisss
