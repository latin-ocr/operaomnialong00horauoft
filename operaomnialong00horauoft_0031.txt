INTRODUGI'ION. 'xxvii

Ganfflin' some real inti-igue and jealousy no doubt are connected, whatever
her nme may have been.

Tho same remark applies in some measure to other odos addressed
nominally to friends, but which might as easily be addressed to one

'friend as ⁴to another. The difference is that the names are in most

instances known to be those of real persons, which has led many com-
mentator-s into inferences respecting the characters and circumstances
of those persons which 1 believe to be inrmost instaures imaginat-y.

’ Ihave expressed my opinion of Horace as a Satirical writer in various
places. On this point the reader may refer to the remarks in the
Introduction to the ninth Satire of the first book. Of common sense
and a perception of the ridiculous3 of that knowledge of mankind which
is gathered by mixing with the world3 of dramatic skill; of good
nature and good breeding‚ Horace has shown sufficient proofS, both in
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic he is certainly defective.
Homer he does not appear to have understood. Plautus and Terence
he could not apprechzte, and the merita of Lucilius (and he must have
had mel-its) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of an indolent habit, of which the unfinished state of
some of his poems is one of the effects. “Amphora coepit Institui3
currente rota cur urceus exit ?'' is a question that might be applied, I
think, to more than one of his Satires and Epistles. There is more

q inequality in these than in the Odes; more also that is common-place in

thought and diction. The Odes will bear better than the Satires and
Epistles the close inspection that an editor is obliged to give them. Any
one who undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his prin-
cipal difficulties consists in the examination, first separately‚ and then
collectively‚ of so many small pictures as the Odes present. The tendency
of commentatore to far-fetched conjectures as to their scope, allusions,
date, δια, is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.
Their beauties and merits appear to me to be of a quiet kind, and
the happy selection of words is one of them. Horace’s selection of
epithets is judicious and forcible. “ Mirus ac paene (livinus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis ⁶.’' The terseness and good sense of the
sayings which concern human life and character are as striking as
the manner in which they are introduced, being always in their place
and never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might
easily appear. Herem, more than in any other respect, Horace suc-
ceeded in his attempt to imitate the Greek Lyric poets. Their firc,
passion, sublimity, his language was incapable of expressing, even if his
mind oeuld have conceived them. Their metres have lost their strength
