20 HORATII FLACCI

Et domus exilis Plutonia: quo simul mearis,
Nec regna vini sortiere talis
Nec tenerum Lycidan mirabere, quo calet juventus
Nunc omnis et mox virgines tepebunt. 20

of this ode Scaliger pronounces that it is “ pure nectar.'’ Its beauty all admit. That
it expresses any but a poetical jealousy on the part of Horace 1 do not believe. That

expresses a lover's jealousy under the pretence of being glad of escape from the toils of
an inconstant mistress· Milton's translation of the ode is well known.

ARGUMENT.

What pretty boy art thou toying with now, Pyrrha ἓ He thinks, poor credulous youth,
it will always be thus with thee, and will timidly wonder when the tempest ariseth.
Ι pity those who have no experience of thee; for my part I have escaped out of the

storm as the walls of the Sea-god show, whereon my dripping gai-ments and the ’
picture of my wreck are hung.
