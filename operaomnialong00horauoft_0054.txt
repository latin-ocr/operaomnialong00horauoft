whether April was so named from ἅφρος 111 honour of 17611116, 01· from ‘aperio' as
opening the pores of the earth, is here decided in favour of the goddess, and soby
Ovid, Fast. iv. 61 sqq„ but the latter is the more probable derivation. The ancients

were bad etymologists.

ARGUMENT.

Τ116 winter is thawing3 the spring is returning ,· the ships are being launched3 the herds
quit their stans, and the ploughman his fireside, and the meadows are no longer white
with frost. Venus and the Graces are leading the danne, and the Cyclops' forge is
burning. Let us bind the head with myrtle or the earth’s first flowers, and sacrifice
a lamb or kid to Pan. Death calls on rich and poor alike. Life is short, Ο Sestius!
aud our hopes we must contract. 'rhe grave awaits thee, and when there no more
shalt thou preside at feast or sigh for the fair young Lycidas.

SOLVITUR acris hiems grata vice veris et Favoni,
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas,

Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus aut arator igni 3
Nec prata canis albicant pruinis.

J am Cytherea choros ducit Venus imminente Luna, 5
J unctaeque Nymphis Gratiae decentes ¹

Alterno terram quatiunt pede, dum graves Cyclopum
Volcanus ardens urit officinas.

2. machinae] The machines mentioned
are called by Caesar (B. C. ii. 10) ‘pha-
langae’ (rollers). Vessels were drawn up
on shore from the Ides of November to the
Ides of March, during which time “Defen-
dens pisces hiemat mare'' (S. ii. 2. 17).

3. neque—aut—nee] The two first of
these form one branch of the sentence and
the last the other. “Neque (pecus aut
arator) gaudet nec prata albicant?

5. Jam Cytherea choro-3 ducit Venae]
Tibull. ii. 3, 3: “Ipsa Venus laetos jam
nunc migravit 111 agros.” ‘Imminente
¹Luna' is no more than with the moon
overhead. But Heinsius renders it “at
the new moon:'’ ἴσταμένῃ σελήνῃ. ‘Cy-
thema Venus' is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. But ib
is analogous to Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων. Cunning.
proposes ‘levis’ for ‘Venusl

7. graves] Τ1116 epithet may have a
variety of meanings, and each editor gives
his own version. Perhaps Horace meant
‘ laborious! The eruptions of Aetna, where
the thunderbolts os Jove were supposed to
be forged, taking place chiefly in the sum-
mer and early autumn, the Cyclops are
fitly represented as preparing these bolts
in spring. See Cic. de Divin. ii. 19 : “ Non
enim te puto 6666 611111 qui Jovi fulmen
fabricatos esse Cyclopas in Aetna putes.”

dum] One of the old commentatam

quaintly observes, that while his wife is
dancing Vulcan is sweating.

8. urit] This seems to be an adapta·
tion of φλέγει, ‘lights up,' and is an un-
usual sense for ‘uro.’ Rutgersius there-
fore preferred the reading ‘visit,' which
occurs in some MSS. of high character.
He quotes Apollon. Rhod. 111. 41:

ἀλλ’ ὁ μὲν Ηφαιστος) εἷς χαλκέωνα καὶ
ἄκμονας ρι βεβήκει

νήσιὲιο πλαγκτῆς εὐρὺν μυχὸν, ᾧ ἔνι
π ντα

δαίδαλα χαλκεύειν ῥιπῇ πυρός· ἦ δ’
(Αφροδίτη) ἄρα μούνη

ἧστο δόμῳ δινωτὸν ἀνὰ θρόνον &rra
θυράων,

where there is certainly a resemblance to
this passage of Horace, bnt not strong
enough to make it probable he had it in his
memory when he wrote this ode. By a
rather remarkable coincidence Bentley ap-
pears to have hit upon these lines of Apol-
lonius, and to have made them a part of
his argument for ‘ visit‚' without knowing
that Rutgersins, with whose notes he was
familiar. had done the same before him.
Scaliger proposed ‘ urget? which is further
from the true reading than ‘visit,' between
which and ‘urit' the preponderance of
evidence sind probability is greatly in
