HORATII FLACCI

Servet in ambiguo qui consulit et tibi et urbi
J uppiter ;” Augusti laudes agnoscere possis z

Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari,

,30

Respondesne tuo dic sodes nomine? Nempe
Vir bonus et prudens diei delector ego ae tu.
Qui dedit hoe hodie eras si volet auferet, ut si
Detulerit fasces indigno detrahet idem.

“ Pone, meum est :²² inquit.

Pono tristisque recedo.

35

Idem si elamet furem, neget esse pudicum,

Contendat laqueo collum pressisse paternum ;

Mordear opprobriis falsis mutemque colores?

Falsus honor juvat et mendax infamia terret

Quem nisi mendosum et medicandum? Vir bonus est quis? 40
Qui consulta patrum, qui leg-es juraque servat,

Quo multae magnaeque secantur judice lites,

Quo res sponsore et quo causae teste tenentur.

Sed videt hunc omnis domus et vicinia tota

Introrsum turpem, speciosum pelle decora.

“ Nee furtum feei nec fugi,’' si mihi dieat

[31. sodes] “ ‘ Sodes ' pro ‘ si audes‚’ ‘ sis ’
pro ‘ si vis τ’ jam in uno ‘ capsis ' tria verba
sunt.'' Cic. Or. c. 45. Cicero understood
‘capsis’ to be ‘cape si vis‚³ and he must
have known how the word was used. But
Quintilian (i. 5. 66) does not allow this.
‘ Capsis’ is like ‘faxis,’ and equivalent to
‘ceperis ;’ but ‘ cape si vis ' might be pro-
nounced ‘capsis.']

32. Nempe vir bonus] Quintius is sup-
posed to answer ‘ Yes, surely Ι like to be
called good and wise, and so do you?
‘Nay,’ replies Horace, ‘ such praise as this
is given one day, and may be withdrawn
the next ς and you are obliged to resign
your claim because you know you do not
deserve it. But if a man attacks me with
charges Ι know Ι am innocent of, is that
to affect me Ρ ’

40. [medicandum] There is a reading
‘ mendacem? and ‘ mendicum' which is
certainly a mistake]

— Vir bonus est quis] The answer is
to this effect : ‘⁴ In the eyes of the people
the good man is he who never transgresses
the laws3 who is seen acting as ‘judex ’ in
important causes, and has never been
known to be eorrupt3 whom men choose
as their sponsor, and whose testimony
carries weight in court ; but all the while
the man’s own neighbourhood and family

may know him to be foul within though
fair enough without.'’

41. Qui consulta patrum] ‘ Leges? pro-
perly so called, were lawe enacted by the
popiillzu· assembly. [As to ‘jux-a: see S.'i.
3. 11.

42. εειΞιηύΜ] See S. i. 10. 15 n. In the
next verse the reading of nearly all the
MSS. and old editions is ‘responsoress
which word occurs nowhere in the sense
of ‘ sponsore ’ (see S. ii. 6. 23 n.), and ean
only apply here to him ‘ qui respondet‚’ that
is, the ‘jurisconsultus.’ The oldest Blan-
dinian had ‘res sponsore,' and Cruquius
defends that reading. So does Bentley,
and it appears in nearly all modern edi-
tions. Torrentius conjectured it, but did
not think it would make goodsense. [But
‘ res sponsore ' is probably the better read-
ing.] ‘Tenere,' in the sense of gaining a
cause, is used by CIcero (pro Caecina, c. 24) ε
“Scaevolam causam apud centumviros
non tenuisse.'’ [‘Judice :’ a ‘ judex ’ named
by the praetorto hear civil musea]

46. Nee furlum feei] ‘There are some
who think themselves very who
would be bad if they dated? To such a
one Horace answers as he answered his
slave when he boasted of his goodness. Ι
understand vv. 46-56 to be a dialog-ue
between the slave andhis masten the
