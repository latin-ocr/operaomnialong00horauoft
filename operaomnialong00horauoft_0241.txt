CARMEN XXVII.

“ The length of this ode is more imposing than the subject, which appears to be a jour-

ncy to'Greece (ν. 19) proposed to be taken by a lady of floraoe’s acq‘uaintance, whom
he pretends to deter from her purpose, by reciting the daugers she will have to encounter
and the fate that waits upon female 'obstinacy‚ as illustrated by the story of Europa,
which story occupies two-thirds of the ode, and thrusts Galatea and her journey from
tho scene altogether. Ι do not see the difficulty of the ode that has arrested most of
the editors. The length of the digression is simply a way with Horace (as in the story
of Regulus, C. iii. 5, and of Hypermnestra, iii. 11), and Pindar took the same liberty
with greater freedom. It is a peculiarity which imitators of Horace will do well to
note, for if skilfully managed it would relieve the tameness of many an ode which, pro-
fessing to be an imitation of this author, has little but his rhythm and a few of his
phrases to sustain the resemblance. [Ritter's remark ou the lady is a good specimen
of his manner of interpretation. If it does not instruct, it may amuse. “Galatea a
lacteis brachiis cerviceque candida nominata, olim Horatio cara, jam virum divitem in
itinere comitari voluit. Iter illud aut in Cretam insulam dirigebatur, aut a viro e

, finmilia Taurorum orto suscipiebatur.- Alterum ut conjiciam faciunt verba (v. 25):

‘sic et Europe niveum doloso credidit tauro latus’ (ut tu Taurum sequi animum in-
duxisti).'’]

By similar arguments Propertius (i. 8) deters Cynthia from going to sca, and Ovid
Corinna (Am. ii. 11). The Scholiast on Homer (11. xii. 307) says the story of Europa
was treated by Bacchylides, whose poem has not come down to us, nor any part of it,
but was probably, as Orelli says, in Horace’s hands. The Scholiast's account of the
story is just that of the present ode. It would be difficult to find a more touching pic-
tum than Horace ‚has drawn of a young girl suddenly torn from her childish amuse-
menb, transported far from the security of her home, and lefl: forlorn among strangers,
knowingno tie but that of her father’s love, to which she instinctively turns with long-
ing and sels—reproach: her fault had been in giving way to a foolish impulse, but she sees
her cn'me through her seara, which magnify it greatly by pointing to the probable issue,
so that she looks upon her idle curiosity as nothing less than madness (v. 36). There
is also great skill in the last stanzas, in which we have, first, the derisive laugh‘aer with
which Venus and her son (whose bow is now unstrung bemuse it has done its work, the
Scholiast says) break in upon the unhappy girl ; then the ironic-al prophecy in which
her own words are used against her; and, lastly, the serious consolation aud congratu-
lation with which they announce her good fortune, aud bid her rise to it. The pain
arising from her complaint is thus relieved, and we are lest with the conviction that she
is reconciled to her destiny and proud of it.

ARGUMEN T.

Iaet the wicked go on their way with evil omens. I do but pray for thee that the storm
may be averted. Be happy go where thou wilt, and remember me, Galatea. Fear not
those idle omens: but see the rising storm: Ι know the dangers it portends. May
they fall upon my enemy rather than on thee. It was thus Europa lefl: her girlish
task and crossed the sea by night, but feared not till she stood on the shore of Crete.
Then she cried out in anguish, “Alas! my father, a daughter's name Ι have aban-
doned; love is swallowed up in madness. What an exchange is here! Many deaths
do Ι deserve to die. Am 1 awake, or is it a dream Ρ Was it better to cross the sea
than to gather young flowers at home Ρ O that I might avenge myself ou that
monster once too dearly loved. Shame on me that I left my home; shame that Ι
delay to die. Iaet me go naked among lions and perish by tigers, rather than waste

⁴ away in a lingering death. Vile girl, thy father taunts thee: why dost thou not die ἱ)
