Q. HORATII FLACCI

OARMINUM

OARMEN I.

About A.U.c. 728.

Tlns and the five following odes are generally admitted to be among the fineet speci-
mens of Horace's manner, and it appears to me that in this didactic style he shows
most of his own character and genius· It is, as far as we know, entirely his own.
There is no opinion from which Ι more entirely dissent than this of anke, “Tota
Horatii poesis lyrica et ex ipsius sententia dici et haberi potest amatoria '³ (F. H. p. 57).
And Buttmann’s sentence, which goes into the other extreme, appears to me as far
from the truth, unless he limits it, as I believe he really meant to do, to the style that
Franke thinks his strongest. “ Non-reality,” he sayS, “ is an essential feature of Horace's
odes.'' The fact appears to be, that rcality was so much a part of Horace’s mind, that
he was never so great as when he wrote on some real subject, something that drew out
his sound common sense, his regard for a friend, his sense of right, his appreciation of
nature, and his feelings in respect to the times he lived in, and especially the condition
of Rome itself. It is this that gives to the six odes with which the third book opens
the force and charm we find in them. It has been already said (C. ii. 15, Introduc-
tiou) that they appear all to have been written about the same time with one another
and with other odes, when Augustus‘set himself the task of socia} reformation aster
the close of the cix il wars.

The general purport of this ode is an exhortation to moderate living and desis-es.

Τὴε first stanza is generally understood to have been added as an introduction to the
six odeS‚ viewed as a whole.

ARGUMENT.

The worldly Ι despise, bnt have new precepts for the young.

Kings rule over their people‚ but are themselves the subjecte of Jove. One may be
richer, another nobler than his fellows, but all alike must die. No indulgence ean
get sleep for him who has a sword ever hanging over him, while it disdains not the
dwellings of the poor. He who is content with a little fears not storm or drought.
The rich man builds him houses on the very waters, but anxiety follows him go
where he will. If then marble and purple, rich wines and costly perfumes, cure not
grief, why should I build me great houses, or exchange for the burthen of riches my

humble Sabine farm ?

Om profanum volgus et arceo;
Favete linguis: carmina non prius
Audita Musarum sacerdos
Virginibus puerisque canto.
