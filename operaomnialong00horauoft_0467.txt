Acci 2] ‘comis’ is usually taken ironically.
I think it is more in accordance with Ho-
race’s temper and the purpose of this
Satire, which is conciliatory‚ to take it
literallyasOrellidoes, referringtothe
description in S. ii. 1. 30, &c- (see below,
v. 65). Accius was born nc. 170, and was a
writer of tragedias, chiefly from the Greek,
but some ‘praetextatae-² Cicer-0 calls him
“gravis et ingeniosus poeta’' (pro Plane.
c. 24), ‘summus poeta (pro Sestio, c.
56). Quintilian’ s judgment will be found
inthenoteonEp p.ii. 1. 56. Horace
speaks elsewhere (A. P. 258) of‘ ‘Acci
nobilibus trimetris,” where, as in the above
Epistle, heis referring more to the popular
dgment than giving his own. Gellius
(xiii. 2) relates how Accius read to Pacu-
vius one of his early productioris (Atreus,
a tmgedy), and that the old man said,
“sonora quidem esse quae scripsisset et
grandia, sed videri ea tamen sibi duriora
paullum et aoerbiomss’ Accius acknow·
ledged it was so, but hoped that what was
hard and harsh in him would be mellowed
by time. Gellius finishes his account of
Roman authors (xvii. 21) with‘ ‘.Q Ennius
