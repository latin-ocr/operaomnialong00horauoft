HORATII FLACCI

Solvat phaselon ς saepe Diespiter

Neglectus incesto addidit integrum.

Raro antecedentem scelestum
Deseruit pede Poena claudo.

‘It is the basis of fficndship, as Cicero says,

and without it society cannot exist. (Com-
pare S. i. 4. 84 n.) It- is possible that
Horace had heard Augustus repeat his
favourite axiom. Mitsch. quotes Calli-
machus (Hymn. ad Cer. 118) x

Δάματερ μὴ τῆνος ἐμοὶ φίλος ὅς σοι
ἀπεχθὴς
εἴη μήδ’ ὁμότοιχος.

Euripides (Elect. 1354) has:

οὕτως ἀδικεῖν μηδεὶς θελέτω,
μηδ’ ἐπιόρκων μέτα συμπλείτω.

This way of speaking seems to have been
proverbial. Compare Aesch. S. c. Τ. 602
sqq. There were no mysteries among the
· Romans corresponding to the Eleusinian or
any of the other Greek Μυστὴρια. But
Cicero, anathematizing Verres at the close
of his last oration, speaks of the rites of
Ceres and Libera (“quam eandem Proser-
pinam vocant‚” Verr. ii. 4. 48), as those
which “sicut opiniones hominum ac reli-
giones ferunt longe maximis atque occul-
tissimis caerimoniis continentur ;’' and,
though introduced from abroad, he says
these rites“ were observed by the Romans
in public and private with such exactness,
that they might appear to have been not
imported into Rome from other countries,
but exported to them from Rome.

28. frayilemve] ‘Que’ is the MSS.
reading, but there is no connexion between
‘trabibus' and ‘phaselon ι’ ‘ve' is Bent-
ley’s correction, [but no MS. is quoted in

confirmation of it. Ritter who reads ‘fra-
gilemque' says that ‘ sub iisdem trabibus '
means ‘in eadem nave sive firma sive non
firma,’ and that the idea of danger is in-
creased by the words ‘fragilemque pha-
selon,' for the ‘ phaselus' is a light and
long vaesel, which is easily broken. lf
Horace meant all this, he was a tasteless
trifler. But the poet means that he would
not live under the same roof with such a
man, and he would not sail with him 3 and
so it is indifferent whether he says ‘and'
or ‘or‚’ though according to the MS. evi-
dence he said ‘ and? ‘ Fragilem ' is merely
a poetical representation of the danger of
navigation.] In respect to ‘Diespiter’ see
C. i. 34. 5 n.

32. Deseruit pede ,Poena claudo] Aesch.

Agam. 57 :

τῶνδε μετοίκων, ὑστερόποινον
πέμπει παραβᾶσιν Ἐρινύν.

The same expression occurs also in the
Choeph. 382,

Ζεῦ Ζεῦ κάτωθεν ἀμπέμπων
ὑστερόποινον ὅταν

βροτῶν τλάμονι καὶ πανούργῳ
χειρί, τοκεῦσι δ’ ὅμως τελεῖται,

and corresponds to ὖστερόφθοροι in Soph-
Antig. 1074,

τούτων σε λωβητῆρες ὑστεροφθόροι
λοχῶσιν ’Ἀιδου καὶ θεῶν Ἐρινύες.

Tibullus expresses the same (i. 9. 4), “Sera
tamen tacitis Poena venit pedibus.”

GARMEN ΙΙΙ.
About A.U.c. 728.

This ode, which could not have been written before A.U.c. 727, when Augustus
received that name, commends the virtue of perseverance by the example of heroes who
had secured divine honours by it. It cannot be said that the long speech of J uno bears
very directly upon the text supplied by the two first stanzas. A propheey of the glory
and extent of the Roman empire might have been adapted to any other exordium, or have
been introduced without any at all. But it was necessary for Horace to diversify his
homilies. The mention of Romulus is mntrived to introduce the praises and power of
