108 HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XI.

The date of this ode has been much discussed. If any argument could be founded
upon the first line, it would naturally be inferred that the Cantabri and the Scythian
tribes were in arms at the time it was written [and the date might be Ritter's, amno.
725} Lentulus' expedition against the tribes of the Danube, who had invaded the
Roman provinces, is supposed, as I have said before (C. 9. 23 n.), to have taken place
while Augustus was in Spain. Supposing this to be alluded to, the date of the ode
may be considered settled within a year, that is, it must have been written about ΛΑΜ).
729 3 and Horace speaks of his grey hairs (v. 15), which is consistent with that date,
for he was then forty. But the date of the expedition of Lentulus is uncertain. 'rho
only authority on the subject is Florus (iv. 12), who does not mention the date or give ,
any clue to it (see C. iii. 8, Ina-od). But aster all it is not necessary to suppose that
Horace meant any thing very definite by thus coupling two distant and troublesome
enemies together. The name Scythian was applied ‘w many peoples, some of whom
were continually giving trouble to the Romans ; and as Estre says (p. 414), if Horace
had said-

“ Quid bellicosus Parthus et Aethiops,”
or “ Quid bellicosus Medus et Allobrox
Hirpine Quinti oegitet Alpibus
Divisus objectis,”

the sense would have been just the same, and the purpose of the writer as well answered,
which is merely to introduce a convivial ode. He has prefixed to it a name we hear of
nowhere else, which has caused a good deal of difficulty to scholars. There is no Hir-
pinus on record but this one, belonging to the Quintian family or any other. whether
this person was a neighbour of Horace’s, and got his name from his Sabine connexion
(the Hirpini were a Sabine people), or whether Horace gave some friend this name
from some familiar whim unknown to us, is a matter of doubt. It has been assumed
that this Quintius, and the one to whom is addressed Epp. i. 16, are the same. But the
latter appears to have been younger than the former, whom Horace addresses as if he
were a contemporary (v. 15). Cruquius would substitute ‘ Crispine’ for ‘ Hirpine? Τ.
Quintius Crispinus was consul with Drusus amno. 745, and it is more probable that the
epistle above referred to was addressed to him than that this ode was. Finally, to sup-
pose, with most of the commentatorS, that this Hirpinus, whoever he was, was anervous
person inclined to look with alm-m on the aspect of affairs, and especially astaid of a
desc-ent of the Scythians upon Italy, is as usual to mistake the character of the ode.
That the disturbances and desigus of the distant tribes were troublesome to Rome and
topics of conversation, is enough to account for their introduction here, without sup·
posing that Horace or his friend attached more weight to them than other people-

ARGUMENT.

Never mind what distant nations are about, nor trouble thyself for the wants of life,
which *wants but little: youth is going and age approaching: the flowers and the
moon are not always bright: why worry thyself for ever? Let us drink under the
shade of yonder tree. Mix wine, boy, and bring Lyde to sing to us.
