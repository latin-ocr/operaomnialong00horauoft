628 HORATII FLACCI

Quandoeunque deos vel porco vel bove placat,

J ane pater! clare, clare cum dixit, Apollo!

Labra movet metuens audiri: “ Pulchra Laverna, v60 ⁴
Da mihi fallere, da justo sanctoque videri,

Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem.”

Qui melior servo, qui liberior sit avarus,

In triviis fixum cum se demittit ob assem,

by C. Caesar and finished by Augustus is
referred to in the inscription quoted
above. Here the ⁶ centumviri ' held their
court. (See S. i. 9. 35 n.) 1..Opi1nius,who
was consul A.U.c. 633, built a basilica,
and called it after hmself; and Augustus
built one in honour of his grandsons, Lu-
cius and Caius, probably in his own Forum
(Sueton. Aug. c. 29).

58. vel porco vel bove] The animals
most commonly sacrificed by the Romans
were sheep, pigs, and oxcn. On public
occasions these three were sacrificcd to-
gether, and the sacrifice was called ‘ suove-
taurilia? being a conibination of the three
' names. Such a sacrifice is represented
on one of the four panels on Constantine's
arch, of which an engraving is given in
p. 884 of the Dict. Ant. Private persons
would only sacrifice the three on great
occasions, and on some there would be
several of each or any of them offered
together. Ordinarily they sacrifice-d but
one, according to their means or their
zeal.

59. Jane pater] See S. ii. 6. 20 n. This
scene is imitated with much power by
Persius (ii. 5 sqq.). Ovid has a similar

scene (Fast. v. 671 sqq.)‚ where he intro-⁴

duces a mercator praying to Mercury to
help him to cheat successfully, and to give
him delight in cheating :—

“Da modo lucra mihi, da facto gaudia

Etiugg, ιιΐῡᾷἕωίοτί verba dedisse ju-
vet.'’ (v. 9 sq.) Ι

Silent devotion was not practised or under-
stood by the aricients any more than it is
by the heathen or Mahomedans now: μετὰ
φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι δεῖ is reported to have
been a saying of Pythagoras. Silent
praycrs were supposed to be a veil either
for improper petitions, or magical incan-
tations, or something wrong. To speak
with men as if the gods were listeuing, and
with the gods so as men might overhear,
is a rule found in more than one writer

(senec. Ep.10. Mam-ob. Saturn. i. c. 7).

Sec the above passage of Persius, in which
he says, “at bona pars hominum tacita
libavit acerra ;'’ and S. v. 184, “ Labra
moves tacitus.'’ A Hindoo‚ seeing nothing
of the Christian’s devotions, believes he
practises none 3 and if you speak to him
of your private prayers, he smiles ineredu-
lously.

60. Pulchra Laverna] anerna was a
goddess associated with Mercury as the
god who presided over thieving. According
to Comm. Cruq. she had a grove dedicated
to her somewhere on the Via Salaria,
which led from Rome through the Sabine
country to the coast. The same Scholiast
derives it from ‘latere :' “Nam fures olim
et laternioues et laverniones dicebantur?
Acron derives it from ‘ lavare :' “ Nam
fures lavatores dicuntur‚” alluding to the
λωποδύται, Ι suppose, those who stole the
clothes of bathers. Vossius (Etymolog. v.
Laverniones‚ p. 282) thinks Acron wrote
‘ levatores’ and that the word is from
‘levare,’ as we say ‘shop-lifting? Buttmann
(Mythol. i. p. 17 ) 'identifies Laverna with
Latona, the goddess of night. Forcellini
adopts λαβεῖν as his solution. Obbarim,
on this passage, has collected all the opi-
nions respecting the etymology of this
word.

61. Inytriviis fixum] Persius, speaking
of a man who was above sordid ways, says
(v. 110), “Inque luto fixum possis trans·
cendere nummum,” where there is a Scho-
lium which says boys used to fasten an as
to the pavement, and amuse themselves
with watehing people stop to pick it up:
and Obbarius quotes an old note on the
Prologue to Persius’ Satires (v. 6), reluting·
a similar amusement resorted to by old
men. Whether this is referred to by Ho-
race, or whether any such practice existed,
is doubtful. It is very likely Horace means
no more than a man stooping topick up an
as from the mud, which seems to be the
origin of that expression of Augustinus
(Confess. v. 12), “lucrum luteum quod
cum apprehenditur manum inquinat.”
