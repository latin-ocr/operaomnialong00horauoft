306 HORATII FLACCI

Unde tibi reditum certo subtemine Parcae 15
Rupere, nec mater domum caerula te revehet.

Illic omne malum vino cantuque levato,
Deformis aegrimoniae dulcibus alloquiis.

μύθων, παρηγορία, which were applied in a to depend upon ‘ malum? In that case
derived sense to any thing that gave relief ‘ alloquiis' would merely mean ‘ conversa-
to sorrow. Otherwise we must introduce tion,' unless, as Bentley suggests, Horace
a conjunction somewhere, and I should meant it in another sense, as ‘lenes sub
prefer it at the end of the previous verse noctem susurri‚' which 1 do not believe.
to the place where Bentley proposestoplace But 1 do not think a conjunction is
it, after ‘ aegrimoniae,' which he supposes wanted.

OARMEN XIV.

That Maecenas was not married, or engaged to be married, in ΛΑΜ). 720, is inferi-ed
from the fact that in a letter written in that year to Augustus by M. Antonius he taunts
him with carrying on an intrigue with Terentia (Suet. Octav. 69, quoted by Franke).

μ Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 28) supposes Maecenas did not marry till he had built his house

on the Campus Esquilinus, A.U.c. 721-22. His domestic happiness was not of long
continuance. But he could hardly have come to the end of it when Horace wmte this
ode, in which* allusion is plainly made to Terentia and her husband’s affection for her
(supposing them to have been married at the time, and not merely betrothed, as Kirch-
ner imagines). These data leave a wide space for the composition of the ode. The object
of it is to excuse Horace for his indolence in not having finished a poem, or volume of
poems, he had long promised. It is generally assumed that this ⁴ carmen olim promis·
sum' was the book of Epodes we now possess. If so, the ode was not written long before
the publication of the volume : for if it had long been promised and was anxiously
expected (as Bentley says), we can hardly suppose that after being stix-red up by his
patron, and with the leisure he must have had at his farm, Horace would have kept
Maecenas and all his friends in further suspense for any length of time, especially when
we consider that the work was not an Aeneid, but a mere collection of comparative
trifles, some of which must have been written early, and few of them could have cost the
author any particular amount of thought. Now one of these odes at least (C. ix.) was ·
written as late as 723, being composed immediately aflzer the battle of Actium, and the
first is almost universally allowed to have been written just before that battle. The book
therefore, under this explanation of ‘ promissum carmen,’ was not published at the
earliest till towards the end of A.u.c. 723, and thus the ode apologizing for its delay
could not have been written much before then. Franke assigns two odes (2 and 17) ω
the following year 724, while this apology he places in 721-22. In this case Horace
must have gone on dawdling with his book at a very slow rate, which under these
circumstances it is difficult to account for. ”

Aster all it is doubtful whether ‘ promissum carmen ’ means this book of Epodes.
Doering considers it certain that it was a single poem. (See note on v. 8.)
