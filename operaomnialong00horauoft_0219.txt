Phrygiae Mygdonias opes.” claudian (in
Eutrop. 1i. 1) speaks of the ruins of 'lh-oy

as “Mygdonii cineres? ‘Alyattei' is
the genitive of‘ Alyatteus,' another form
of ‘Alyattes’ (kingof L ydia), as Achilleus
-ei of Achilles, Ulyxeus ·ei of Ulyxes.
Bentley established this reading, to which
Tan. Faber made an approximation in
‘Alyattii,’ seeing that ‘HalyatticL’ the
reading of all former editions, had no mean-
ing, though the editors supposed it to mean
Croesus, the son of Alyattes. I do not
find that there is a reading ‘yAl attei,’
but itis now generally adopntgd. [ἶ Parva
vectigalia-⁹ Horace' s small mcome. Cicero
uses ‘vectigalia’ in the same sense- The
meaning of‘ porrigam’ isgiven in the In-
troduction, and the word can have no other
meaning here. Ritter, following Acron,
says ‘porrigerevectigaliaestdareinmannm
eolligentis.' But aster the conquest of
Macedonia (Β. c. 167) there was no land-
tax (tributum) in Italy ; in Cicero’ s time
(ad Attin. ii. 16) the ‘ portoria’ were abol-
ished, and there remained no tax in Italy
except sive per cent. on the value of ma-
numitted slaves. There was, therefore,
nothing for Horace to pay. Ritter re-
marks that Augustus established the‘ cen·
tesima,’ or tax of one per cent. on articles
sold (Tacit. Ann. 1. 78), but that tax would
not touch Horace. Further, Ritter' s trans-
lation of‘ porrige rnge’re is inconsistent with
‘continuem' &c., which makes Horaee’ s
meaning certain. I omit part of Ritter’s
ment, which requires ιιο notice.]
42. Multa petentibus] The same senti-
ment appears in C. iii. 24. 63:

“Crescunt divitiae, tamen
Cui-tae nescio quid semper abest rei.'’
‘Bene est’ occurs again in Epp.i.1.89:
“ J urat bene solis esse-maritis?
