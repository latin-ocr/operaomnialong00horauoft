EPISTLE IV.

Something has been said about Albius Tibullus, the poet, in the Introduction to C. i.
33, which is addressed to him, as this Epistle is. Horace writes to him (probably from
Rome) at his place near Pedum, a town of Latium, not fur from Praeneste, which, Por-
phyrion says, did not exist in his day, and the site of which is supposed to be occupied
by the modern town zagarola. Tibullus had a good estate there, inherited from his
father, which before his death he appears by some means to have diminished (S. i. 4.
28 n.). That it was not by his own extravaganee, and that his losses must have oc-
curred aster this Epistle was written, we may perhaps infer from v. 7. He alludes to
them in the first of his elegies (i. 1. 19 sqq.) ι

“ Vos quoque, felicis quondam nunc pauperis agri
Custodes, fertis munera vestra, Lares ;''

md in Lib. iv. 1. 181 sqq. there are some bitter lines on the same subject. But it is not
probable that these lines were written by Tibullus3 and if not, the language of the elegy
above quoted is not enough to prove that the diminution of the property took place
after it came into his possession. He might call his estate ‘pauperem agrum’ by com·
parison, and he might still by Horace's standard be rich. He says in i. 1. 41:

“ Non ego divitias patrum, fructusque requiro
Quos tulit antiquo condita messis avo.''

He may therefore be supposed to contrast his estate with what it was in the times before
he came to it, rather than with its earlier condition under himself. Nevertheless there
are some who suppose that Horace wrote this Epistle to console Tibullus, and to chide
him for being melancholy, referring to v. 12, which, as Orelli says, contains nothing
more than a general description of human life. sse description Horace gives of
Tibullus' person is confirmed by an old biography, which calls him “ eques Romanus
insignis forma cultuque corporis observabilis? He lived chiefly on his estate in the quiet
pursuits Horace here supposes him to be engaged in; but in A.u.c. 723, immediately
after the battle of Actium, he accompanied Messalla into Gaul and was absent about a
year, which as far as we know compr-ised all his active life, though Dissen has endea-
voured to show that for ten years, from ast-0. 712 to ¹722, he served in the army.
Horace among other blessings assigns him good health ς nevertheless he died young. It
appears that while many disparaged Horace’s writings Tibullus judged them kindly,
and the affection the two poets bore one another cannot be mistaken. Tibullus was
probably ten or twelve years younger than Horace. various attempts have been made

Α to give a date to the Epistle, but none are satisfactory to my mind. Tibullus died the
