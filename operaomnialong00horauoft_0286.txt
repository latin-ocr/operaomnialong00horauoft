HORATII FLACCI

Aeternum opprobrium, quod male barbaras
Regum est ulta libidines.

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium

Custodes ovium carmina fistula, 10

Delectantque deum cui pecus et nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, 'Virgili 3

Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum

Si gestis, juvenum nobilium cliens, 15

Nardo vina merebere.

Nardi parvus onyx eliciet eadum
Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis,
Spes donare novas largus amaraque
Curarum eluere efficaX. 20

(Odyss. xix. 518): ἀηδὼν . .
ρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον, which version Ovid
seems to follow (Am. ii. 6. '7 sqq.) :—

“Quid scelus Ismarii quereris, Philomela,
’ tyranni?
Expleta est aunis ista querela suis.
Alitis in rarae miserum divertite funus.
Msigna”sed antiqua est causa doloris
tys.

So Mart. (x. 51), Soph. Elect. (148), Ca-
tull. (lxv. 14). virgil makes Philomela
the slayer of Itys (Ecl. vi. 79) :—

“Quas illi Philomela dapes, quae dona
thargiilrgix deserta petiverit, et quibus
Iniciiiss sua tecta supervolitaverit alis ?''

In short the legend is more varied than
almost any other. I have already had oc-
casion to observe how little accuracy was
studied by the poets in such matters (C.
iii. 4. 50 n.). Fea quotes a sepulchral in-
scription which represents no doubt the
grief of the nightingale (Fabretti, p. 233,
n. 612) :—

“sunea aaran. marm. NB. ME. noc-
masona. masona.
‘nnumin ur. MAERENS. Ari-1011.
MATER. 111⁸?

8. Regum] The lust of kings as ex-
cinplified in one of them, Tereus. Some
might be disposed to take ‘male' with
‘ barbaras,’ as “rauci male '⁹ (S. i. 4. 66),
and other places (see Index); and 1 am
not so confident as other editors that it
belongs to ‘ ulta.'

9. Dicunt] O. iii. 4. 1. ‘ Delectante’
(v. 11) is a various reading adopted by
Gesner without much authority, and Bent-
ley reads ‘ nigrae ’ with little authority.

15. juvenum nobilium cliens] Any at-
tempt to determine who these were, until
it is settled whom the ode is addressed to,
is useless. (Introduction.) Catullus, in-
viting a friend to his house, says, if he will
bring the supper, good and plentifnL with
a fair damsel, wine, and spirits, he
will give him a box of ointment so deli-
cious that when he smells it he will pray the
gods to make him all nose. Respecting the
ointment expressed from the ‘nardus‚’ whe-
ther that name belonged toa shrub or aroot,
the reader may consult Schleusner’s Lexi-
con and the commentators on John xii. 3.
Mark xiv. 3. There we learn that a pound
was worth upwards of 300 denarii, which
sum was equivalent to more than 10l.
sterling. The ‘ onyx’ was another name
for alabaster (Forcell. ‘alabastrites,’ and
Plin. H. N. 36. c. 8), of which, as we find
in the New Testament as well as here and
elsewhere, boxes were made for perfumes.
‘ Sulpicia horrea ' were famous wine-cel-
lars which originally belonged to one of
the Sulpiciau family, and, according to
the Scholiasts, continued to bear the name
of Galba, the cognomen of a branch of that
gens, in their day. There are inscriptions
extant in which mention is made of the
‘ horrea. Galbiana! Horace, professing to
have no good wine of his own, says he will
buy a cadus of Calenian (C. i. 20. 9).
‘Amara curarum' is a Greek construction,
not uncommon in Horace, as “ acuta belli '⁹
(C. iv. 4. 76) 3 “corruptus vanis rerum''
