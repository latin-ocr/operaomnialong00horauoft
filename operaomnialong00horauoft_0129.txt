Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho
Nil interest an pauper et infima
De gente sub divo moreris,
Victima nil miserantis Orci.
Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
Versatur urna serius ocius
Sors exitura et nos in aeternum
Exilium impositura cumbae.

was white, and αἴγειρος, which was dark.
virgil calls the white ‘bie-olor? ‘ Amant?
as in C. iii. 16. 10, is used like the Greek
φιλοῦσι ‘are wont,’ though some would
‘give it a siu-onger meaning, i. e. twine their
branches like lovers, as ‘ lascivae hederae?
How little that notion suits with the epithet

‘phos italis’ must be obvious to any one.

25. coyimur] ‘ We are driven like
sheep,' “Tityre coge pecus ’' (Ec. iii. 20).

26. Versatur urna] Compare C. iii. 1.
16: “Omne capax movet urna nomen.'’
The notion is that of Fate standing with
an ιιι-ιι, in which every man's lot is cast.
She shskes it, and he whose lot comes out
must die. Ovid has imitated this passage

virgil has a like expression (Geor-gf iv. 24), (Met. x. 32) :—

23. moreris] This reminds us of Cicero
(ds Senect. 23): “Commorandi natura de-
versorium nobis, non habitandi dedit.’'

28. Exilium] This is put for the place
of exile, as (Ov- Fast. vi. 660): “ Exilium
quodam tempore Tibur erat. '’ The word
is only another form of‘ exsidium,' from

‘—ex —lsedeo The usual form ιιι inscriptions
is ‘fcumbae not‘ c ymbae‚’ as applied to
the boat of Charon. The Scholiasts use

GARMEN IV.

A.u..c 729.

This amusing ode represents a gentleman‘ ιιι love with his female slave (ancilla); a
circumstance of sufficiently common occurrence to warrant the supposition that
Horacemsy have lud one of his friends in view. The name Xanthias must be fic-
titicus, and Phoceus indicates that the person was also supposed to be a Phocian. It
is usual to suppose that “ Xanthias Phoceus'’ represents two names. and “ad Xanthiam
Phooeum ’' is the common inscription, as if Phoceus were a Latin name, which the
seoondline proves it is not. Why Horace, assuming a Greek name for his real σι·
supposed friend, should also make him a Phoc-ian, who can pretend to tell Ρ “ Say it
was his humour‚” or there may have been a significauce in it which has passed away,
or never existed, except for the person addressed and perhaps a few intimate friends.
Xanthiss was a name given to slavae, as in the “ Frogs ’' of Aristophanes.

Horace was born A.u.c. 689, and he wrote this ode when he was just finishing his
dghth lustre, which would bein December, A.u.c. 7 29.
