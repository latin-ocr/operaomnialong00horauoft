Ferre sinu laxo, donare et ludere vidi,
Te, Tiberi, numerare, cavis abscondere tristem;
Extimui ne vos ageret vesania discors,

Tu Nomentanum, tu ne sequerere Cicutam.

Quare per divos oratus uterque Penates,

Tu cave ne minuas, tu ne majus facias id
Quod satis esse putat pater et natura coiircet.
Praeterea ne vos titillet gloria jure

Iurando obstringam ambo : uter aedilis fueritve

Vestrum praetor, is intestabilis ct sacer esto.
In cicere atque faba bona tu perdasque lupinis,

Tiberius always counted his caxefully and

hid them, carrying a serious face wherever
he went3 and from these early signs of

s - character he foresaw that one would prove

ι a spendthrifl: and the other a miser. As
toNomentanus see S. i. 1. 102 n. ς and on
menta, v. 68.

178. natura coercet] Nature keeps
within bomds, defines, limits. [Comp. S. i.
1. 502 ⁸ your natural wants detine? Ritter
most absurdly explains ‘coercet’ of the
natural boundaries of the Canusine

[lad. ‘atem’ ἄρα] See S. i. 2. 63.]

181. ie intestabilis et sacer esto] A

n who was ‘intestablis ’ was ‘infamis’
and something more. He could not appear
aa awitness before a magistrate, and so
. lost virtually much of his civil capacity,
wliich was not a consequence of ordinary

‘infamia.’ (See Dict. Ant„ art. ‘-1nfa
nial) He was al o, Unterholzner says
(ap. Heindorf), inca pable of the right of
ε-ιιιιιιιιι’ἰ[ιιί;ἱο,’ and incapable of all proceed-
ings‘ per aes et libram‚’ because in such
witness& were wanted. He

was not able to witness a will, or, accord-
ing to Cruquius’ Scholiasta, to makea will,
or receive any thing by will. The conven-
tioml meaning of‘ intestabilis' came to be
the same as ‘detestabilisss As to‘ saccr’
Festus (quoted by Heindorf) say s: “Homo
sacer is estquem populus judicavit ob
maleficium, neque nefas est eum immolari,
sed qui occidit parricidii non damnatur,
nam lege tribunicia prima cavetur, ‘Si
quis eum qui 9ο plebiscito sacer sit occi-
der-lt, paricida ne sit.³ Ex quo quivis
homo malus atque improbus sacer appellari
solet.” Thus Oppidius impreeates a curse

sons were already secking votes, he says to
each of them (for ‘tu ' must be so under·
stood), ‘so you would tbrow away your
money in distributing largesses to the peo-
ple (such as the aediles were wont to give)
in order that you may strut about in the
Circus, and have a bronze statue voted you
—that is to say, that you may be loaded
with the same honours as the great
Agrippa, like a fox aping a lion! It was
customary for the aediles to distribute
grain or beans and lupines to the common
people at the festival of the Floralia (Comm.

sVCruq.) See Persius (v. 177) :—-·

 

‘⁴ vigila, et cicer ingere large
Rixanti populo. nostra ut Floralia possint
Aprici meminisse senes?

Agrippa, after he had been praetor and
consul, undertook the aedileship, which
was the lowoet of the curule offices, in
A. U. c. 721, to gratify Augustus· His
munificence was very great‘ ιιι the ereetion
of public buildings and the celebration of
games on a splendid seule, and large dona-
tions to the people. ‘Latus spatiere’ is
explained in the note on Epod.

erected in the Forum. It may be ob·-
served that Oppidius plainly means the
first part of his address, from ‘In cicere,'
dcc. to apply to the careless extravagant
2Aulus, while the simile of the fox and lion
is only applicable to the astute Tiberius,
who, if he spends his money, will look for
a substantial return for it in such honours

iv. 7. Such
were usually

Amd rewards as he saw Agrippa had won.

The old editions till Lambinus had ‘laetus ς’
‘latus’ is the reading of all the MSS. The
greater number of MSS. are in favour of
‘aut aeneus‚' and that‘ is the reading of all
the editions till Bentley, who adopts that
of some good MSS, ‘et aeneus, '[See C.
iii. 3. 65 n.] ‘Aeneus ut· stes’ is likec.
