246 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT-

Ι have a good old amphora of Alban with parsley and ivy to make thee a crown, Phyllis3
silver on my board, and an altar that waits for the sacrifice3 the slaves are busy, the
111-8 15 burning, come and celebrate the Ides of April, for it is Maecenas' birthday‚
more sacred to me than my own. Telephus is matched already, and is no match
for thee. The fates of Phaethon and Bellerophon teach thee to beware of ambition.
come, my last love, with thy sweet voice sing the song 1 shall teach thee i song shall
drive care away.

EST mihi nonum superantis annum
Plenus Albani cadus ς est in horto, “

Est hederae vis
Multa, qua crines religata fulges ς 5
Ridet argento domus 5 ara. castis

Vincta verbenis avet immolato

Cuncta festinat manus, huc et 111110
Cursitant mixtae pueris puellae ς
Sordidum flammae trepidant rotantes

Vertice fumum.

2. Albani cadus] The wine of the Alban
111115 was of the better kind; and at Nasi-
dienus' supper it was offered to the chief
guest with Falerniau (Sat. ii. 8. 16). Pliny
(N. H. xiv. c. 6)p laces it third among the
wines of Italy. Juvenal (v. 33) speaks of
Alban wine, and classes it with Setiam,
both of great age: —

“Cras bibet Albanis aliquid de montibus
Sentiiiigecujus patriam titulumque senec·
ngesvit multa veteris fuligine testae.”

The rich glutton drank it, he says, as 8
corrective of yesterday’s debauch.

5. qua crines religata fulges] ‘ With
which, when you bind your hair, you look
beautiful? The commentators look for the
future tense, but Baxter, uncorrected by
Gesner, says it is “ enallage temporis; ful;
{⁶33 {igfflff 30122‘3 ⁸⁰3⁶ss sssst-'ieoufiss‘ffl
present tense, and Horace merely says that
a wreath of ivy becomes Phyllis, whenevcr
she binds her brows with it.

8. Sparyier agno] See Introduction,
sub fin. Rutgersius (Ven. Lec't. c. ii.) has*
discussed the question whether it was usual
to offer sacrifice on birthdays. Varro, in a
passage quoted by Censorinus ((18 (118 na-

10

tali, c. 2), says that the ancient Romans
(majores nostri) observed the custom of
ahstaining from blood when they brought
offerings to their genius on their birthday.
But itis clear from this of Horace
that, whatever was the custom in earlier
times, victims were in his day offered on
birthdays as well as any other days. Ju-
venal (xi. 84)=—

“Et natalitium cognatis ponere lardum
Accedent? nova 51 quam dabat hostia
carne,-

and Plutarch (Life of Romulus, 0. 12) speaks
ing of the Palilia, which was the feast of
the birthday of Rome, says, ἐν ἀρχῇ δέ, ὥς
φασιν, οὐδὲν ἔμψυχον ἔθυον ἀλλὰ καθαρὰν
καὶ ἀναίμακτον ᾤοντο δεῖν ‘r‘ πατρίδι τὴν
ἐπώνυμον τῆς ’γενέσεως ἑο , ν φυλάττειν,
which shows that even at the Palilia the
practice was no longer observed in the time
of Plutarch. There is uo further authority
wanted than this passage of Horace to es-
tablish the fact as regards private birth-
day' festivals: nor will Orelli’s remark be
admitted, that, though the ge from
Varro might establish the opposite fact if
Horace were keeping his own birthday, it
does not follow that he might not shed
blood in celebrating that of Maecenas.
As to ‘ Verbenis: see C. i. 19. 14 11.
