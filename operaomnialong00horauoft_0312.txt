were set to drive the beasts into a given
spot, where they were attacked and slain 3
or else they were driven down to the nets,
with which they were entangled or stopped,
unless they contrived, as they sometimes
did, to break through them, which would
give occasion for a chase iu the open plain
(see C. i. 1. 28). Plutarch, in his life of
Alexander speaks of toils twelve miles long.

The poets, Latin and Greek, used the
feminine gender in speaking of hunting-

dogs, as mares are more osten mentioned
than horses for the race. ‘ Amites' were
forked stakes on which the nets were
stretched. ‘ Plagae ’ were the strong nets
mentioned above ; ‘retia ’ were finer ones
'for birds and fish ; ‘ retia rara ’ were those
with wider meshes than fishing-nets, and
therefore used only for birds. ‘ Edacibus ’
represents their depredations on the corn3

Doering applies it to their greedy seizure
of the bait. The next line is said by its
numbers to represent the rapid course of
the hare and crane. If so, Doering con-

trives to annihilate the poet’s purpose by
his punctuation,

“ Pavidumque leporem, et advenam, la-

queo, gruem,
J ucunda, captat, praemia,”

by which it is intended 1 suppose to show
that‘ laqueo ’ represents the instrument of
capture, and is not to be tak'en with the
word that goes before it as if Horace meant
to say that the crans was ‘advena laqueo,'
an error not likely to be made. 1 (10 not
see that the sound in this line represents
the sense.¹1t rather halts than flies.
‘’Laqueo may be pr onounced as a dissyl-
lable. [“ Across every break· in the woods
or chasm in the hills [of Ischia] rows of
nets are placed to intercepi: stock-dovoe

and quails in their annual flights.” Swin-
burne, The Two Sicilies -ii. 5.]

39. in partem] ‘ On her part? The
Greeks said ἐν μέρει. ‘In partem’ occurs
in Plautus (Asin. iii. 3. 89), “Age sis tu
in partem nunc jam hunc delude.”

41. perusta solibus] Theoc. (x. 26).
Βομβύκα. χαρίεσσα Σύρ αν καλεοντί τυ
πάντες ’1,σχνάν ἆλιόκαυστον, ἐγὼ δὲ μόνος
μελίχλωρον.

42. Pernieis] ‘Pernix' significa patient,
stedfast, being compounded of ‘per’ and
the root of ‘niti.’ (Servius on Virg.
Georg. iii. 93.) When applied to motion
it means swiflz, by the 'natural consequence
of a steady movement of the wings or feet,
which accomplishes distance more rapidly
than irregular speed.

43. Sacrum vetustis] The {ire-place was
sacred to the Lares. The wood must be
old that it might not smoke like that which
plagued the travellers at Trivicum (S. i.

lacrimoso non sine fumo,
Udos cum foliis ramos urente camino.''

The ‘focus ¹ was either a fixture of stone
or brick, in which case it was synonymous
with ‘caminus‚’ or it was moveable and
made of bronze, and then it was called
‘foculus’ In either case it was a wide
and shallow receptacle for wood or char-
coal, the smoke of which found its way out
by apertur-es at the top of the room, or, in
some rare instances, as modern scholare
have established, by ehimneys (Becker’s
Gallus, Sc. ii. Exc. i.‚ ou the Roman
House, sub fin..) ‘Sacrum et,’ ‘·sacrum
