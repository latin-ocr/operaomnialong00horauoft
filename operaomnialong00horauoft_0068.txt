32 HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XII.

mue. 725—729.

Marcellus married J ulia„ the daughter of Augustus, A.U.c. 729, and died 731. The
allusion in v. 45 of this ode makes it quite certain that it was written before the death
of Marcellus, and after he had attained an age iu which he could give promise of sus-
taining the distinction of his name. The meaning of that stanza is plainly this: “ The
fame of the house of Marcellus, taking its birth from the great Claudius the victor of
Syracuse, is growing up through successive generations like the insensible growth of a
tree, and promises to come to maturity in Octavia's son.'' Franke thinks the ode was
written before Augustus went against the Cantabrians in 7 29, and about the time of
Marcellus' marriage, when he was only in his eighteenth year. Others place it aster
Augustus’ return from Spain in A-U.c. 730, and the closing of the temple of Janus. 1
think with Franke some allusion to this event would have been made had the ode been
written then. Torrentius thinks it was one of those hymns which by order of the Senate
(according to Dion Cassius) were addressed to Augustus, as a god, aster the battle of
Actium. At that time Marcellus was in his fourteenth year, but even then Augustus
was very fond of him and had great hopes of him. The poem has much of the appear-
ance of an ode for music, but a hymn composed on the occasion Torrentius supposes
could hardly have failed to allude to the successes it was intended to celebrate. 1 prefer
Franke’s opinion to the others 3 but there is no possibility in my judgment of fixing the
date precisely. A.U.c. 729 appears to be the latest year to which it can be properly
assigned, and 725 the earliest.

The opening is taken fr0m the second Olympic ode of Pindar, which begins—

ἆναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομενῐ
But the rest of the ode ,seems to be original. Pindar asks whom he shall sing, and
immediately sings of Tberon. Horace, though he makes Augustus the climax of his
song, goes through the praises of Jove aud his children, and then of twelve of Rome’s
principal wei-thies, before he comes to Augustus. The common inscriptions, therefore,
“AD Ansusrimss’ or “nn Aueusro‚” do not seem to express the scope of this ode,
which is rather to celebrate the popular divinities and heroes of Rome than Augustus
exclusively ς though this design is so worked out as to draw the chief attention to him.

ARGUMENT.

Whom wilt thou sing among gods or men, Clio? Whose name shall the echoes of
Helicon or Pindus repeat, or of Haemus whose woods followed the sweet music of
Orpheus ἰ’ Whom before the almighty Father, who knows no equal or second Ρ Astel-
him cometh Pallas and then brave Liber, and the huntress Diana, and Phoebus the
archer, and Hercules and Leda’s sons, the horseman and the fighter, before whose
star the tempests fly. Then shall it be Romulus, or the peaceful Numa, or proud
Tarquin, or Cato that nobly died Ρ Regulus, and the Scauri, and Paulus, who gave
up his great soul to the Carthaginian gratefully, 1 will sing, and Fabricius, and Curius,
aud Camillus, all trained for war in poverty’s school. The fame of Marcellus is grow-
ing up insensibly like a tree, and the star of Julius is brighter than all stars. To thee,
great Futher, is given the care of Caesar· share with him thy kingdom. Putting
Parthians to ssight and subtluing the nations of the East, he shall rule the world as
thy vicegerent with a righteous sway, while thou dost shake Olympus and hurles t
thy bolts upon the haunts of impiety.
