-HORATII FLACCI

Sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc

Res ubi magna nitet domino sene; dulcia poma

Et quoscunque feret cultus tibi fundus honores

Ante Larem gustet venerabilior Lare dives;

Qui quamvis perjurus erit, sine gente, 61116111118 15
Sanguine fraterno, fugitivus, ne tamen illi

Tu comes exterior si postulet ire recuses.”

“ Utne tegam spurco Damae latus?

p. '70 n.). Columella (viii. 10) gives in-
structions for rearing them, and says,
“ 1111116 8618118 nostrae luxuries quotidiana
facit haec pretia.” ‘ Turdus’ was not the
common thrush, but the fieldfare, which
is still reckoned a delicate bird. [‘Pri-
vum,’ from which there is the derived form
‘ privatum,' means ‘proprium :³ ‘whether
a thrush shall be given to you or any thing
else as a 1116861113 Β111 1116 meaning of
‘privum’ may be extended to signify
‘ something choice.']

14. Ante Larem] The first-fruits were
offered to the Lares, as represented on a
gem in Gorlaeus' collection, P. i. No. 190,

’ 111 which 18 8 naked figure standing by an

altar with a basket of fruit in his right «τ

hand and two ears of corn in his left.
Tibull. i. 1. 13 :—

“ Et quodcunque mihi pomum novus edu-
cat annus

Libatum agricolae ponitur ante deo.'’

No divinity was dearer to a Roman than
his Lares, whose images stood in his hall,
who reminded him of his departed ances-
1018, and whom he invoked and sacrifieed
to every day at his meals (C. iv. 5. 34).

15. sine gente] Suppose him to be a
‘libertinus‚' aud in former days to have
run away from his master, in which case
he might be branded ou the forehead, and
the shame of attending him would be
greater. He would also be ‘sine gente?
that is, he would belong to no ‘gens,' if
he were the descendant of a freedman, or
had suffered ‘capitis diminutio,’ if the de-
finition of ‘gentilis’ by Scaevola given by
Cicero (Top. vi.) 18 6011661 (Dict. Ant. art.
‘Gens‚’ p. 418 a). Horace means one of
low birth, or who has been disgraccd.

17. Tu comes exterior] Tiresias ad-
3186811181, if the rich man should call upon
him to attend him when he walks abroad,
he should never refuse 10 80, taking the
least honourable place, which was by his
patron’s side, and usually between him
and the road. The Seholiast’s explana-
tion, “Exteriom sinisterior, in sinistra

Haud ita Trojae

parte positus‚” is not sufficient: the busi-
ness of the humble companion was to g1ve
his patron the wau and to walk outside,
“ sive dexter sit sive sinister,” as Porcellini
says (s. v. ‘interior ’)- The expressions
‘ tegere latus: ‘ claudere latus,' were
common enough, and meant plainly to
take that side which was most exposed.
See Juvenal (iii. 131) :—

“ Divitis hic servi claudit latus ingenuorum

Filius
where ‘servi ’ means, 88 11616, 0116 who had
been a slave. Martial calls the companion

‘ latu-53 but the expression was probably
peculiar to himself (vi. 68) :—

Inter Baianas raptus puer occidit undas
Ειίξιζεξῗῗ, 1116 11111111, Casti-ine, dulce

 

Ovid, speaking of the respect shown to a
senator of the olden time on account of his
age, says (Fast. 3. 67) :—

“ Et medius juvenum non indignantibus
Ibffissst interior si comes unus erat.''

Suetonius, speaking of the condescension
of Claudius (6. 24), says, “Aulo Plautio
etiam ovationem decrevit (on account of
his success in Britain), ingressoque urbem
obviam progressuS, 61 111 Capitolium eunti
et inde rursus revertenti latus texit. '’
Eutropius (vii. 13), repeating the same
anecdote, says‚‘ ‘conscendenti Capitolium
1863118 incederet, 'from which 11 would
seem as if the 1688 honourable place was
called conventionally‘ laevus? though the
outside must as osten be right as left (Epp.
i. 6. 50 11..) ‘Utne tegam' is a short way
of saying ‘hortarisue me ut tegam?
‘Damae' 18 used generally as a common
name of slaves (seeS. i. 6. 38). ‘'Spurcus
is a word Lucilius used, as in· that verse
quoted by Cicero (Tusc. ii. 17), ‘Ergo hoo
poterit ‘Samnis spurcus homo 3118 illa
dignus locoque. ’θ’ '[‘ Certaus melioribus!
⁴ melioribus’ 18 1116 (181136. ]
