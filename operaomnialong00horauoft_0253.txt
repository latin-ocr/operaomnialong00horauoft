CARMEN Ι.

³ . ιι i. cieu- that nome, ,sta- the publication of the first three books of 111⁸ odes, inid

adde that style, or wrote in it only occasionally. So far as his lyrical compositione ex·

’ paud, isin his ease they ever did, any realpassion, growing years and bodily infirmity

wouldnaturnlly turn him from writing odes. So far as his poems were mere imitations
of the Greek, we αιιι understand his getting tired of that style as he grew older, and

,· ,ωηιξη ω a„ more original and serious mk which employed him in the Epistlee. of

 

the lighter sort, therefore, we find but few in this book, and those probably inserted to
mbo up ι sufficient volume. But his severer style he had not loet, and none of his
nrlier cmupositious surpass the moral and historie-11 odes of this book. Why he should
lure writtm the first it is not easy to say. It was oomposed apparently ‘ invita Minerva:
end except the moothness of its rhythm it has little to commend it. Nobody will read
it and believe that the man was in love who wrote it, still less that he was influenced by
a drivalling affection for the boy Ligus-inus mentioned at the end, and in C. 10 of this ’
book. Perhaps he found a Greek ode that took his fancy and imitated it, and then
publiahed it to fin his book, not as a prologue to it, as many of the chronolog-ists say,-
for what is there in the ode that bears that· character? The sixth verse says it was
nium when he was about fiflzy (eirea lustra decem), which age he attained on the Sth
nomba, bunc. 739. Δ fragment of Alcman (20 Bergk)—

ἔρος με δ’ αὖτε Κύπριδος ἕκατι
γλυκὺς κατείβων καρδίαν ἰαίνει-

to be part of an ode which this of Horace might be imitated from. So likewise
mnf Ib5cus (2 Bergk)—-

ἔρος work με κυανέοισιν ὑπὸ βλεφάροις τακέρ’ ὄμμασι δερκόμενος

κηλήμασι παντοδαποῖς ἐς ἄπειρα δίκτυα Κύπριδι βάλλει·

ἦ μὲν τρομέω νιν ἐπερχομέναν, κ.τ.λ.
· 1 do not associate the ode with C. iii. 26 for the reasons there stated. But there is so

’ much resemblance between this and C. i. 19 as to confirm me in the opinion that they
nm both imitationa·
ARGUMENT.

Art thou at war with me again, Venus Ρ spate me, for 1 am old. Go to the young. Go
to Paullus, for heis noble, handsome, elever. Give him the victory, and he will give
thee' m return a mar ble statue m ashrine of citron‚ with‘ incense, music, and dancing
in hishome by the Alban lake. 1 have no longer a heart for love and wine, and yet,
Ligurinas, whydo 1 weep anadream ofthee?
