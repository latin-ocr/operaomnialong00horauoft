HORATII FLACCI

ideas writing to his master Annaeus Cor-
nutus :—

“ Non equidem hoc dubites amborum foe-

. 23. refulyens] Shining in opposition‚ so
as to counteract his influences. Thus it is
doubtful whether ‘Saturno' be governed
by ‘refulgens‚’ or ‘eripuit.' Compare
Persius v. 50, ‘ Saturnumque gravem
nostro Jove frangimus una.' Bentley
prefers ‘ volueres‚' but ‘ celeres ' would be
a more suitable epithet for ‘alasj as in
C. iii. 29. 53.

26. ter crepuit sonum] So Propertius
iii. 10. 4:—

“ Natalis nostrae signum misere puellae
Et manibus faustos ter crepuere sonos.”

‘ Puellae,' i. e. ¹ Musae? See C. i. 20. ‚3 :
the reception was in one t eatre, but Ho-
race writes ‘ theatris? Ritter says ε “ So-
nus quo gaudent theatra plausus est. Hine
numerus multitudinis hoc loco explicatur.”
But this is not the explanation. ‘ Thea-
tris' means from all or many parts of the
theatre, as ‘ complere castrorum fossas ’
means to fill np many parts of the ‘ fossa '
which surrounds a camp. So Caesar uses
¹ silvae ' for various parts of a forest]

28. sustulerat] The use of the indica-
tive in hypothetical cases of this kind is
not easily reduced to rnle, but it seems to
oon-espond to the Greek construction of ἄν
with the indicative. When the condition
is not fulfilled, or is a negative condition,

or implies a negation‚ then the consequent . .

clause may be expressed by the indicative
mood, in the pluperfect tense if the action
be a complete action and past, in the per-
fect if it be present. “Sustulerat si non
levasset: sed levavit-'⁹

See Wagner on
Aen. ii. 55 [and Conington's note].

also Wagncr’s note on Aen. iv. 19 :—

“ Sifnon pertaesum thalami taedaeque
Huihllsseiini forsan potui succumbere ⁸
cu pae,'’

where the perfect is used to express what
might have been done at the time of speak-
ing, for which the Greeks used the imper-
fect. In C. iii. 16. 3, there are ‘munie-
rant ' and ‘ non risissent? Professor Key
(L. G. 1216) says that the apparent excep-
tions to the rnle that in such cases as this
the subjunctive is required in both clauses,
are, for the most part, to be explained by
the sentences being elliptical. He explains
this passage as a “ mere instance of ordi-
fflrssffiffi‘ssffimfss'arffluffl ἶῗοὲἶῗέ
trunk down gliding on his skull had car-
ried off (or nt least would have done so),
had not Faunus with his hand lightened
the blow.'’ It is very difficult to put into
words the nicety of a conventional expres-
sion. Mr. Key’s judgment always coin—
mands respect, but this explanation is
hardly satisfactory, I think ; though it is

our own language, in which Horace's
meaning might be thus expressed, “the
trunk had killed me, had not Faunus
lightened the blow.'’ Mr. Key adds in a
note, “it should be observed, that in sen·
tences of this character the ‘nisi ' or ‘ si '
commonly follows.'’ See Mr. Long's note
on Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 49, “licitum essct,
. veniebant.'’ Horace was under the
particular care of Mercury, the Muses, and
Faunus, to each of whom, as well as to
Liber (iii. 8. 7), he attributes his preserva-
tion on this memorable occasion (C. iii. 4.

27). Faunus or Pan was the son of Hermes
or Mercury.
