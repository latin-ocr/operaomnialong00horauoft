annually of my bile! Ι should otherwise be the first of poets. Never mind, 1 will
serve as a whetstone for others, and teach them what a poet should be.

(v. 309.) 'Philosophy is the foundation of good writing. The books of Socrates and his
disciples shall teach you the science and duties of life in all its relations, which he
who learns knows how to suit his words to his characters. Also he should study ι
real life, and get living words from this. And sometimes common-places strikingly
put commend a play of no great merit more than empty verses and harmonious
nonsense.

(v. 323.) The Greeks had genius and eloquence, and loved praise above every thing.
Roman boys learn nothing but arithmetic and accounts, and how can we expect them
ever to write poetry worth having?

(v. 333.) Poets wish either to profit or to please, or to join both these together. There-
fore when you give advice be brief, that the mind may follow and retain your
precepts. A full mind scorns superfluities. Also let your fiction be like truth- The
elders will not listen to that which is immoral, while the younger will have nothing
to do with severe poetry. He then is universally liked who mingles the profit-able
with the pleasant. His book sens, and his fame is carried into distant lands and
times. “

(v. 347.) Perfeetion however must not be expected, and allowance may be made for
occasional blots ; but he who repeatedly fails in spite of warning is a mere Choerilus
to me. 1 am surprised and am inclined to smile if he has a verse or two that is
good, just as Ι am grieved if Homer now and then nods.

(v. 361.) Poetry is like painting : there is some that bears close inspection, some must

. be seen at a distance ς some bears hearing once, some to be repeated osten.

(v. 366.) Mediocrity is tolerable in some things, but not in poetry: if that does not
mount to the highest point it sinks to the lowest. Nevertheless, though they do not
attempt other things for which they are not qualified, people venture upon poetry
who know nothing about it. Of course! are they not freemen and virtuous and
well—to-do in the world Ρ

(v. 385.) You are too sensible for this 3 but if you ever do write, submit your pro- -

ductions to the judgment of your friends, and be in no hurry to publish them.
WVords once issued cannot be recalled.

(v. 391.) The first poets civilized mankind, so that Orpheus was said to move beasts
and Amphion stones with the lyre- The philosophy of the olden time lay in framing
institutions and Iaws, regulating society, building cities ς and by promoting these
the poets won their fame. Theu came Homer and Tyrtaeus urging men to
martial deeds ; oracles were delivered in verse ,- and the duties of life were taught 3
and the favour of princes won 3 and the husbandman refreshed after his toil: so you
need not be ashamed of the lyre.

(v. 408.) It is questioned whether poetry comes by nature or by teaching. Ι think
both must be combined. He who would succeed in poetry, must take great pains
while young, and submit to teaching. Leave it then to others to say, ‘ 1 am a fine
poet 3 1 will not be lest behind in the race, or acknowledge that Ι do not know what
I never learnt? .

(v. 419.) The rich poet buys flattery. I should be surprised if such an one could
distinguish between a true friend and a liar. If you have made a man a present, or
are going to do so, do not invite him to hear your verses. He will be sure to applaud
and weep, or lang-h or dance with pretended pleasure. Flatterers are like the hired
mourners at a funeral, who make more fuss than the friends. But as princes leam
men’s characters by plying them with wine, so do not you suffer yourself to be
deceived. Quintilius would tell you plainly to alter this or that, and if you could
not, to strike it out ς or if you preferred retaining it he said no more, but leflz you
