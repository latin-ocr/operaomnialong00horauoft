Narratur et prisci Catonis
Saepe mero caluisse virtus.
Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves
Plerumque ἀοι-ος tu sapientium

apply to the elder Cato, as in‘ ‘priscis me-

13. Tu lene {mentum ingenio? Thou
appliest a gentle spur to the usually unge·
nial temper! ‘ Duro ingenio’ does not, Ι
think, as Bentley says, signify ‘ the genius
that finds it hard to express itself,' but the
reserved temper whose sympathies are not
easily drawn out, as in Terence (Phorm. iii.
212), “Adeon’ ingenio esse duro te atque
inexorabili.'’ ‘ Sapientium' Dillenbr. sup-
poses to be said ironieally, signifying the
Sir Oracles, “who therefore only are es-
teemed wise for saying nothing.” 1 think
it has a more serious aud kindly meaning,
and applies to the philosophical and
thoughtfnl (as ‘ sapientia’ is put for philo·
sophy, C. i. 34. 2), who have little to do
with mirth till they are brought out by
cheerful company. It is said that in his
odes Horace alwya s uses the termination

‘ium’ for the genitivep lural of nouus cnd-
ing in‘ ens,' and for participles the termi-
nation‘ tum? But the instances of either
are not numerous enough to determine a
rule, and the so called nouus are usually
participles, as‘ sapiens’ is. ovid probably
had this e of Horace in his mind
when he wrote the following verses (A. A.

i. 237) :—

“Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus
cagozgit multo diluiturque mero.
Tunc veniunt risus, tunc pauper cornua

Tuhtbudbtl’oret curaerugaqnefmnfisabit.
Tunc aperit mentes aevo rai-iaeima nostro
