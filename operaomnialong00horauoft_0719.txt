Verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus heriles,
Litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti
Cuilibet 3 argilla quidvis imitaberis uda ;
Quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti:

Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo

10

Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces,

Res urget me nulla ; meo sum pauper in aere.

Nemo hoe mangonum faceret tibi3 non temere a me
Quivis ferret idem. Semel hic cessavit et, ut fit,

” In scalis latuit metuens pendentis habenae.

aeeordingto his owner's estimate ς which he
professes to put in a modest way, for sear
he should seem to be pnffing his property,
and so depreciaoe its valae.

[9. canet indoctum] ⁸ You will find that

12. aneo eum pauper in aere] ‘Aes
alienum’ is used for a debt, and ‘ aes pro-
prium,’ ‘snum‚’ &c- is therefore money not
borrowed. Cicero opposes them (in Verr.
ii. 4. 6) = “At hominem video auctionem
fecisse nullam ς vendidisse praeter fructus
'suos nihil unquam3 non modo in aere alieno
nullo, sed in suis nummis multis esse et
semper fuisse? [So Cicero says, Pro
Bos. Gom. c. 8.] “Aes alienum eet quod
nos aliis debemus ς aes suum est quod alii
nobis debent'' (Dig. 50. 16. 213, quoted
by Mr. Long on the foregoing passage).
'l'he man here says he is not rich, but he
has no debts.

13. Nem hoc mangonum faceret tibi]
He professes to deal as a friend. The
‘ ’ were slave-dealers, a class in
no favour, but osten very rich. The prin-
cipal person in this line of business in
Augustns’ time was one ‘rhox-anius (Suet.
Aug. o. 69). The name is derived from the

μάγγανον, μαγγανεύειν, to juggle,
cheat. They were distinguished from ‘mer-
catui-es? being called ‘venaliciarii’ (Dig.
50. 16. 207). Hence in Plautus (Trin. ii.
2. 53 sq.) we have—

“risuum is, egetne 3³ LY. Eget. Pa.
Habuitne rem Ρ LY. Habuit.
ΡΗ. Qui eam perdidit ?—

20

Mereatur-amne an venales habuit, ubi rem
perdidit ?''
where ‘ venales' means ‘ servos?

14. Semel Iu'e cessavit] He once was
behind his time, and hid himself under or
on the staircase for sear of a flogging.
‘Cessator’ and ‘erro' were synonymous
word& (See S. ii. 3. 286 n., and ii. 7. 100,
113 n.) The stairs may have been dark
sometimes, and, as in most houses the
principal accommodatiori was on the
ground floor, it is probable that so much
regard was not paid to the lighting of the
staircase as we pay now. Cicero, speaking
of Clodius (pro Mil. c. 15), says: “eum
se ille fugiens in scalarum latebras abdi-
disset,” Milo might have put him to death ⁵
and again of the same person in another
speech (Philipp. ii. 9) he says M. Antonius
would have killed him, ‘⁶ nisi ille se in
scalas tabernae librariae conjecisset.” It
appears that a whip was hung up in some
conspicuous place to frighten the slaves.
Comm. Cruq. says it hung in the middle of
the house, and that slaves were tied ω the
stairs to be flogged.

16. Des nummos] This line Orelli gives
to Horace. 1 think it is the conclusion of
the dealer’s speech.

17. poenae securus] Among the faults
the seller of a slave was bound to tell was
running away. (See S. ii. 3. 285 n.)

[18. Prudens] ‘ With full knowledge!
Comp. S. i. 10. 88, and ii. 5. 58. ‘Lex :'
‘ the tex-ms of the bargain! Dig. 18. 1. 40:
‘ Qui fundum vendebat, in lege ita dixerat
ut &a :' ⁴ in lege: in the conditions of sale,

- as we name them.]
