1. Odiprosamm vulqus] Thefirst stanza
ia an imitation of the language used by the
priests nt the mystea-ies. There is a parody
011 the same in the Frogs of Aristophanes

(³⁵3 Ι’(11) ³-

11. Descendat in Campum] The comi-
tia. centuriata at which the election of
magistrates took place was held in the
Campus Martius, from whence, Tacitus

says (Ann. i. 15), the Comitia were removed

 

εὐφημεῖν χρὴ κάξίστασθαι τοῖς ἡμετέροισι
‘gangines τοιῦνδε λόγων ἢ γνόμην μὴ
ει

ἢ ’γενναίων ὄργια Μουσῶν μήτ’ εἶδεν μήτ’

- ἐχόρευσεν.

“ ‘Favere linguis? like εὐφημεῖν, in its first
meaning seems to signify the speaking
words of omen. But it came as com·
monly to signify total silence. [‘ Linguis'
is the ablative. The Romans sometimes
nid ‘ ‘ ' or ‘ore favere.'] Horace
speaks as if he despaired of impressing his
precepta on any but the young, and bids
the rest stand aside as incapable of being
inffiated in the true wisdom of life.

3. Musarum sacerdos] Ovid calls him·
sels the same (Amor. iii. 8. 23) :—

“ lllggsgg Musarum purus Phoebique sacer·

[5. in proprios greges] Caesar has this
nse of ‘imperium in greges) ‘power over,’
in B. G. vi. 19, ‘in uxores potestatemq

’1. ἐνίῳκΡΙιο, cuneta] There is some
abruptness in this, which Cunningham re-
moves by inserting '‘ et?

9. Est ut] This is equivalent to ἐστὶν
ὥς, ‘it may be.¹ Bentley prefers ‘ esto ut,'
and Cruquins’ Scholiast says in his note, as
’ we have it, ‘est pro sit? He appears to
have read ‘esta' ‘ Esto’ without. ‘ut' oc-

by Tiberius to the senate, meaning that
the senate chose the magistrates, under his
dictation. But in the time of Augustus the
form of comitia continued in the Campus
Martius. (Sueten. August. c. 56.)

13. Cos-tendat] This verb is used some·
times as a transitive verb for ‘petere‚’ as
in Cic. in Verr. (ii. 2. 53), “Hic magistra-
tus a populo summa ambitione contendi·
tur.'’

16. Omne capax] Compare C. ii. 3. 26,
and likewise i. 4. 13; ii. 18. 32.

17. Distn‘atm enus] Some MSS have
‘destrictus' which most editors adopt.
Cruqnins inserts ‘districtus’ in his text,
and Heindorf supports it on S. ii. 1. 41,
where it occurs again. The Scholiasts, ac-
cording to the text in Ascensius, have the
same word, which is probably the right one,
as signifying the separation of two things
which have been joined. But the point is
doubtful. [Ritter and Keller have ‘de-
strictus?

18. sig-ulae dapes] Plato (de Rep. iii.
p. 404, § 13, Becker) speaks of Συρακοσίαν
τράπεζαν καὶ Σικελικὴν ποικιλίαν ὄψου,
where Ast says “ pervulgatae sunt luxurio-
sae mensae Σικελικαί, Συβαριτικαί, Ἰταλικαί
et ximl’ Plautus, in the prolog-ue to the
Rudens (v. 53), says—

“ Infit lenoni suadere ut secum simul
Eat in Siciliam, ibi esse homines volup-
tuarios ”
Dicit.”
