the town which was taken by Camillus,
had long ceased to exist. (See Lucan. vii,
392, quoted on Epp. i. 11. 6, and Propert.·
iv. 10. 27 sqq.) It had been replaced
(whether on the same site or not is uncer-
tain) by a new city, which when Horace
wrote was almost‘ in ruins, having suffered
in the late civil wars. C. Julius Caesar
divided its lands among his soldiers.1n
the year Ad>- 1811, on the eastern side of a
hill ιιι the neighbourhood of the place now
called Isola Farneoe, eleven miles north of
Rome, there were discovered the remains
of this town, columns, and indications of
large buildings aud temples, with marble
statues of Augustus, Tiberius, Germanicus,
and others, and several public and private
inscriptions, from which Fea quotes‘ ‘nvm-

lands assigned in perpetuity by the state to
private persons. The process by which this

‘limitatio ' was effected is described by
Niebuhr very elaborately in the. two appen-
dixes to the second volume of his Roman
History. “ Every field which the republic
separated from the common domain was
marked out by boundaries. No separation
could take place without such a demarca-
tion; and wherever there were any traces
of the latter, although particular estates
within the region subjected to it might still
beppart of the domain, it was yet a certain
proof that such a separation had taken
place.” “ The principle of the Roman

‘limitatio' was to draw lines toward the
four quarters of the heavens parallel and
crosswise, in order to effect a uniform divi-
sion of the lots of land which were trans-
ferred frbm the public domain to private
property, and to fix immutable boundaries
for them. Hence these boundaries (‘ li-
mites ') were marked by a slip of land lest
sor thep purpose untouched by cultivation, as
balks or ways, as their extremities were by
a row of stones inscribed with numerals '’
(p. 624). Niebuhr conjectures “ that a
fundus assigned by the state was considered
as one entire farm, as a whole the limits of
which could not be changed.” But though
this should be true, and though each fundus
as a whole might bear the name of the first
grantec, “ this did not preclude the division
of estates, nor even the sale of duodecimal
parts of them3 but the original boundaries
circumscribed them as one integral whole,
aud all the parts were pledged for the eon-
ditions of the first assignment.'' “ Hence
the termini comportionales” (p. 633).
These are such ‘ termini ² or conventional
boundariae as Horace here refers to: a
stone perhaps or au image of the god Ter-
minus, with a tree or aclump planted near
