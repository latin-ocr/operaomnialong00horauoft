HORATII FLACCI

(Si modo plura mihi bona sunt) inclinet, amari
Si volet : hae lege in trutina ponetur eadem.
Qui ne tuberibus propriis offendat amicum
Postulat, ignoscet verrucis illius 3 aequum est

Peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus.

75

Denique, qua-tenus excidi penitus vitium irae,
Cetera item nequeunt stultis haerentia, eur non
Ponderibus modulisque suis ratio utitur ae res
Ut quaeque est, ita suppliciis delicta coercet?

Si quis eum servum patinam qui tollere jussus

80

Semesos pisces⁴ tepidumque ligurierit jus
In cruce suffigat, Labeone insanior inter

Sanos dicatur.

Quanto hoc furiosius atque

Majus peccatum est : paulum deliquit amicus,

72. trutina] This word applies equally
to the ‘ libra,’ a balance with two scales
(⁶1ances’), and to the ‘statera‚' or steel-
yard, both of which were in use among the
Romans. ‘ In trutina ponetur eadem‚’ he
shall be weighed in the same balance, is
not a very exact way of saying, he shall be
tried by the same standard, his character
shall be estimated in the same way.

74. iynoscet] 'Hie MSS. vary between
the future indicative and the present sub-
junctive. Perhaps the future is more after
Horace’s style.

76. quatenus excidi penitus] ‘ Inasmuch
as (C. iii. 24. 30) the vice of passion and all
other vices that cleave to fools cannot be
entirely eradicated.' All were fools with
the Stoies, as with most other sects, who
were not wise after their fashiou. [Doe-
derlein correctly observes that ‘ suis ’ does
not refer to ‘ratio‚' but to ‘res ;’ and ‘ suis’
means the rule and measure which properly
apply to things (res).]

81. ligur-ierit jus] Orelli follows the
analogy of other words formed like this
(which has the same root, ‘lig,’ as ⁴ lingo')
and having the termination ‘ —urio.’ Most
of the editions and of the MSS are said
to have two ‘ r's' 3 and Heindorf, on their
authority, adopts that way of writing the
word. Mr. Long (Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 76)
prefers the single ‘r.’ ‘ Pisces patiuarii'
were boiled fish served up with sauce in an
open dish.

82. In cruce szffyat] Cicero has the
expressions ‘iu crucem sublatum ³ (Verr. ii.
5. 3), ‘ ad palum alligatos ’ (lb. c. 6), which
5¹1? 1212‘Zf2rh312‘20ti'12 issffethssnifflssff’stcffiffi
“ damnatis crucem servis fixeras.”

— Labeone insanior] The Scholiastsspeak
of ‘ Labeo ' as M. Antistius Labeo, alawyer
of eminence, who had attached Augustus
very freely, and was therefore set down as
a madman by Horace to please his patron.
Marcus Labeo was the son of Quintus, and
both were eminent jur-ists. The father was
of the party of Brutus and Cassius, was
present at Philippi, and put himself to death
after the battle. Tacitus (Anu. iii. 75)
writing of the year ΔΑΜ). 775, about sixty
years after the composition of this Satire,
says that in that year died Capito Ateius
and Labeo Antistius, two rival lights of
their age. If, then, he is the person Horace
means, it could not have been for his bold·
ness of speech towards Augustus that he
calls him mad, for he could at the outside
have been but a youth when this Satire

was written. [As appears from the passage ‘

in the Digest, i. 2. 2. 5 47, referred to
by Ritten] Either, therefore, some other
Labeo [some real madman, probably,] is
intended, or some other mad freak of M.
Antistius Labeo. From the way the name
is introduced, one might suppose it was
proverbial. What Horace says is, that if
a man were to do su. he would be mlled by
all sane men more insane than Labeo, who
must therefore have had the reputation of
being mad, whoever he was.

84. paulum deliquit amicus] ‘ Say'your

friend has committed a fault so small that .

if you do not excuse it you must be looked
upon as harsh3 you hate him in your bit-
terness, and run away from him.’ ‘ Con-
cedo' is used in this way by other writers.
Bentley would prefer ‘quoi ' for ‘ qnod?

referring to the next Satire, v. 1405 ‘ cui si .

concedere nolis? But he does not say why
