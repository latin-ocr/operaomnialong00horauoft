HORATII FLACCI

Tota abit hora.

Avertunt somnos, absentem ut cantat amicam

Nauta piger saxo religat stertitque supinus.

Ora manusque tua lavimus, Feronia, lympha.

many more P—-you’ll swamp the boat !''
says the boatman. The bank is crowded ς
the passengers all want to be attended to
at once. They rnsh 011 board, and the
boatman, afraid of his craft upsetting, or
, wanting to take as few as he can for his
money, tries in vain to keep them out.
This is one way ‘of taking the words,
which Orelli gives. It presumes that the
boat was hired by the party, and that they
divided the cost among them. But ‘dum
aes exigitur' seems to mean that the fare
was collected from each passenger‚ in
which case the boatmen would have an
interest in taking as many as they could
get, and only the passengers would com-
plain of being crowded. [And so ‘Huc
appelle! Trecentos inseris’ are either the
words of a passenger, or of the ‘pueri.']
The collection of the fare and putting-to
the mule being accomplished‚ Horace goes
on board. The boat starts, and he lies
down to sleep‚ disturbed much by the mos-
quitoes and the croaking of frogs. The
boatman (nauta) and one of the passengers
(viator), half drunk, sing maudlin songs
till the one drops off to sleep, and the
other, having a mind to do the same, stops
the boat, turns the mule out to graze, lays
himself down, and snores till the dawn of
day, when one of the passengers wakes,
starts up in a passion, and falls foul of the
boatman and the poor mule, who is put-to

ple of Feronia, about fifteen miles from
the place where they cmbarked. Virgil
mentions it (Aen. vii. 799) :

quis Jupiter Anxurus arvis
Praesidet et viridi gaudens Feronia luco.''

 

‘ Cerebrosns' is an old word signifying
‘cholericss ‘Dolare’ is properly to trim
a. piece of wood with an axe, ‘ dolabra.’ It
is only herc used in this sense, ¹ he rough-
hewed him with a cudgcl? Feronia was a ‘
goddess worshipped originally by the Sa-
bines. There was a town and wood at the
foot of Mount Soracte, which bore her
name, Lucus Feroniae, and where she was
worshipped. On the site of the shrine of
Feronia, near which Horace and his party
disembarked, there now stands, according
to Walckenaer, an old tower, bearing the
name Torre Otto-facia. Bentley's reading
‘ lavimur' for ‘lavimus‚’ that of all the
MSS. and old editions, is bad. Au his qno-
tations in support of ‘lavimur’ refer to
taking the bath. Horace says they only
washed their hands and face, which would
be 110 little refreshment aster a night spent
in a canal-boat.

[15. Ritter places a full stop aster
‘somnos' and a comma after ‘certatim,’
which is better than the punctuation in
the text. If ‘ ut ’ were omitted and a full
stop placed at ‘certatim‚' the sense would
be clearer. Ritter supposes the ‘viator’
to be the man ‘qui mulam ducit juxta
fossam ς’ Kriiger, to be a man who is
walking along the bank of the canal. ‘Dor-

had lost flavour, as Pliny says (H. N. 14.
20, 25), by having fermented twice, was
named ‘ vappa ε’ and the term was given to
a ‘probrosus homo, quum degeneravit ani-
mus.' See S. i. 1. 104, and ii. 3. 144.]
