96 HORATII FLACCI

J am te sequetur: currit enim ferox
Aetas et illi quos tibi dempserit
Apponet annos; jam proterva 15
Fronte petet Lalage maritum,
Dilecta quantum non Pholoe fugax,
Non Chloris albo sic humero nitens
Ut pura nocturno renidet
Luna mari, Cnidiusve Gyges, 20
Quem si puellarum insereres choro,
Mire sagaces falleret hospites
Discrimen obscurum solutis
Crinibus ambiguoque vultu.

13. ferox Aetas] Time is compared to
a wild horse, as in Ovid (Fast. vi. 764):

“Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies.”
['lhe‘ ferox aetas' is the season of y.outh
Comp. Cicero de Sen. c. 10, ‘ferocitas ']
Cruquius would make ‘ferox' and
‘fugax' change places. Bentley conjec-
tures ‘ quod tibi dempserit apponet annuS,’
because, he says, the idea of time taking
away the man's years to add to the
woman’s is as far from Horace's meaning
as can be. It is true that Horace does not
mean it in the same sense as J ason meant
when he proposed to give up his own life
to prolong his father’ s (Met. vii. 168):

“Deme meis annis et demptos adde pa-
renti3’ ’but he means ‘she will approach
the flower of her age as you recede from
it ;' and expresses it thus, ‘ her years will
become more numerous as the remainder
of your time becomes shorter? The Scho-
liasts take this view of the passage ε “ pro
viribus et aetatis flore ponit annos; quae
jam per senium minuerentur, illi augeren-

tur'' (Acron). The way of speaking· is
like that of Deianira when, comparing gher
owiilagli and attractions with those of her
τιν s e says:—

6ρῶ ’γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσιν πρόσω, ’

τὴν δ’ αὖ φθίνουσαν (Tr-ach. v. 547 ΒΨ).

It is also explained by those verses in the
Epistle to the Pisones :—

“Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda*

secum,

Multa recedentes adimunt” (v. 1¹75 sq.).

Bentley destroys his own argument by pro·
posing ‘ quot ' for ‘quos' in case the other
suggestion be not accepted.

24. ambiquoque vultu] Ovid expresses
the same ambiguity m the case of Atalanta
very elegantly (Met. viii. 322).—

“Talis erat cultus, facies quam dicere vere
Virgineam' m puero puerilem in virgine

possis?
On the name of Gyges see C. ii. 17. 14 n.

of Septimius the Scholiast Acron write& “

commilitonem suum hac ode alloquitur.’'

Septimium Equitem Romanum amicum et

Whether this description as to the rank and

former service of Septimius be correct, or whether the latter is only gathered from v. ¹7,
we cannot tell. He has been supposed to be the person of whom Augustus writes to

Horace in a letter preserved in his life attributed to Suetonius ε

“ 'rai qualem habeam

memoriam poteris ex Septimio quoque nostro audire. Nam incidit ut illo coram fieret a me

tui mentio.''

Horace also wrote a letter of introduction for him to Tiberius (Epp. i. 9).

Beyond this we know nothing of Septimius. except that Cruquius' Scholiast makes him
the same as Titius in the epistle to Julius Florus (Epp. i. 3, v. 9, see note).
