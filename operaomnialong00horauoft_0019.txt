PREFACE. xv

nawa. Ι do not feel that I have any peculiar aptitnde for this
kind of work, and the same may be said of many who have under-
taken it. I have, however, noticed nearly all the variations in ι
Ritter’s text, and 1 think that some of them are improvements. Ι
have noticed also some of Keller's readings in the Odes, but Ι have
found very little in them that seems to me of any value.

When the manuscripts agree, and there is nothing unintelli-
gible, it is consistent with the evidence to let a passage stand as it
k, audit is inconsistent to attempt to improve it. When there is
diversity of readings in any case, we must determine which we will
accept on a balance of probabilities. If no reading gives a sufficient
sense, we may endeavour to extract fi-om the supposed false readings
something which does give a sense and may be what the eopiers
would have written if they had taken due care. Many excellent
corrections have been made in this way, and they commend them-
selves to our judgment as true, that is, as possessing sufficient
probability to be accepted as true.

There is another method which we may use in deciding between
conflicting readings, and also in determining whether a passage,
where there is no variation in the readings, may be considered
genuine. In the case of Horace, for example, if we study the
general purpose of each poem, if we have made ourselves well ac—
quainted with his manner of expression and his poetic colouring‚
and if we fix our attention closely on all the words of a given pas-
sage, and the connexion of the whole passage with that which
precedes and follows, we may often determine with great probability
what he intended to write, where the evidence leaves it doubtful3
and we may also determine whether critics are justified in putting
their own guesses in place of the documentary evidence, when there

>is no variation in it. The power of justly interpreting is therefore
’ a. necessary qualification for a critic who undertakes to settle a text>

whether ancient or modern ; as necessary as it is for the commen-
tator who undertakes to explain his author. There are indeed in
Horace many passages, where the text may be quite right, and yet
the interpretation is doubtful. I have found more of these passages
than I expected, and some about which editors will always differ.
