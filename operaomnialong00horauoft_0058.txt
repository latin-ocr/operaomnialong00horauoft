22 HORATII FLACCI

It has been conjectured with probability, and it is confirmed by a Scholium‚ that this
ode was written soon after the battle of Actium, when Agrippa's glory was 81 118 height.
It would seem that the general had asked Horace to write an ode in 1118 110110111; but he
had the good sense 1ο decline a task which he might not have executed satisfactorily to
the great man or himself: at the same time 118 declined in the most graceful way by
intimating that Agrippa deserved an Epic rather than 811 0(18, and the pen of Varius
rather than of Horace. As 130 11118 L. Varius Rufus, 888 S. i. 5. 40 n.

ARGUMENT.

Varius shall sing in Homeric strain of thy vietories by sea andland. My humble 1111188
(18188 1101 sing of 111888, of the wrath of Achilles, or the wanderings of Ulysses, or 1118
fate of Pelops' house, nor will she dispar-age thy glories and Caesar's. who 8811 fitly
sing of Mars mail-clad, of Meriones black with the dust of Troy, of Diomed 8 11181811
foi· gods? Ι sing but of feasts and of the 11811188 of boys and girls.

Quam rem cunque ferox navibus aut equis

Nos, Agrippa, neque haec dicere nec gravem 5

Nec cursus duplicis per mare Ulixei
Nec saevam Pelopis domum

2. carminis alite] ‘Alite’ is in appo· Chabot, whose ponderous commentary 1

sition with Vario. Because in prose the
ablative of the agent without 8 preposition
is not admissible, ‘alite‚’ which is the read-
ing of 811 1118 MSS„ has been sometimes
altered to ‘ 811113 Β111 Horace has the 881118
construction Epp. i. 1. 94: “ Curatus in-
aequali tonsore.'’. S. ii. 1. 841 “ Laudatus
Caesare.'’ C. iii. 5. 24: “ Marte populata
nostro? Orelli's note about the ablative
absolute would not explain one in ten of
the instances in which this poetical con-
struction occurs. It is most frequently
found in Ovid. The Scholiasts Acron and
Comm. Cruq. finding ‘ alite‚’ and not con-
necting it with ‘ Vario‚' rendered it as if it
were ‘ under the auspices of Homeric verse‚'
and they have found some followers.

3. Quam rem cunque] The construction
is by attractiou. The full expression would
be ‘ scriberis et scribetur omnis res quam-
cunque.’ Muretus' reading is ‘ qua rem cun-
que’ for ‘ whe1·ever,' which Bentley adopts
in his text with a great deal of his own sort
of argument, which brings no conviction to
plain miuds. The MSS. do notvary. Bent-
lcy calls 10 his assistance, as‘ vir eruditus?
one whose cumbrous pedantry he would
have been the first to discover, had he not
found occasion to agree with him, 11781181

have attempted 10 make use of 111 vain.
Agrippa's great success up to this time
had been 111 the Perusian war (in which he
had the principal command under A

tus), 111 Gaul and Germany, by land; and

‘ auspicia’ belonged only 10 Augustus.

if 118 had said. ‘I should not think of
sing-Ing gof these victories any more than Ι
should of the wrath of Achilles? Compare
C. iii. 5. 27- 30:

— neque amissos colores.
