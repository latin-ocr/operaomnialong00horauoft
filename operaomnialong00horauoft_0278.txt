HORATII FLACCI

Non sola comptos arsit adulteri
Crines et aurum vestibus illitum

Mirata regalesque cultus

15

Et comites Helene Lacaena,
Primusve Teucer tela Cydonio
Direxit arcu3 non semel Ilios

Vexata 3 non pugnavit ingens

Idomeneus Sthenelusve solus

20

Dicenda Musis proelia 3 non ferox

Hector vel acer Deiphobus graves
Excepit ictus pro pudicis

Conjugibus puerisque primus.

Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona

Multi 3 sed omnes illacrumabiles
Urgentur ignotique longa
Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.
Paullum sepultae distat inertiae

Celata virt us.

Non ego te meis

Chartis inornatum silebo,
Totve tuos patiar labores

13. arsit] This governs ‘crines' as
‘mirata' governs the other accusatives-
See C. ii. 4. '7 n. [‘Illitum,’ ‘intextum,’
Ritten] Laodamia writes thus to her hus-
band of the chax-ms by which Helen was
wonz—

“ Venerat (Paris) ut fama est multo specta-

bilis auro,
Quique suo Phrygias corpore ferret
His egle victam, consors Ledaea gemel-
Sul-igicor 3 haec Danais posse nocere
puto (Ov. Her. 13. 37 sqq.) 3

and Hecuba upbraids Helen with the same
weakness (Eur. Tro. 987) 2—-

ἧν οὑμὸς υἷος κάλλος ἐκπρεπέστατος,

ὁ σὸς δ’ ἰδών νιν νοῦς ἐποιήθη Κύπρις·-
ὅν ’γ’ εἰσιδοῦσα βαρβάροις ἐσθήμασι
χρυσῷ τε λαμπρὸν ἐξεμαργώθης φρένας.

17. tela Cydonio] Teucer is described
by Homer as ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν τοξοσύνῃ
(11. xiii. 313). Cydonia was a. town of
Crete, and the Cr ctans were famous
archers. (Virg. Ecl. x. 59.) v

[18. Ilios vexata] This feminine form

ffitguffs also in Homer, Ἴλιος ἱρή, 11. vi.

27. Urgenlur] So C. i. 24. 5: “Ergo
Quintilium perpetuus sopor Urget i’” ‘ 11·
laerumabilis' is used in an active sense
C. ii. 14. 6. See C. i. 3. 22 n. The idem
comes from Pindas- (Nem. vii. 12 sqq.) 2-

αἱ μεγάλαι ’γὰρ ἀλκαὶ
σκότον πολὺν ὕμνων ἔχοντι δεόμεναι.

29. Paullum sepultae] Vix-tue if it be
left in obscurity is in no better position than
dulness (which signifies generally a gross
unspiritual nature) when that too ιε bnried ς
one is on a par with the other as far as in-
fluence is concemed, for neither exercises
any influenee at all 3 aud as far as his repu-
tation goes, a man may ss well be hux-iod
in stupidity as have his virtues buried in
oblivion. “A man that hideth his foolish- -
ness is better than a man that hideth his
wisdom.’' These words of the son of Sirach
(Eecl. xli. 15) have some resemblance to
Horace's, and I have seen them quoted
together, though 1 do not remember where.
But the sentiment' ιε not the same. Any
English render will remember Gmy’s lines
in his Church- -yard Elegy that correspo nd
most closely to Homce’s.13ent1eyp⁰haa.

to the common reading and proposing ‘in-v ⁴
ertia’ (the ablative), as if Horace meant. ,
