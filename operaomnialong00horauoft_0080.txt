44 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XVII.

It may entertain the reader to know that a treatise was once written on the subject
of Horace’s Tyndaris, in which it was proved to the satisfaction of thc writer that she
was a freedwoman of Rhaemetalces, king of Thrace3 that she is the person Horace else-
where speaks of as Thressa Chloe, simply Chloe, and Venus Mariua ς also that she was
a poetess. It being assumed that the last ode was addressed ιο Tyndaris, according to
the common inscriptions, it is supposed by many that the lovers had made up their
quat-rel, and that Horace here proposes a meeting ιο seul their reconciliation. All this
which is plainly unreasonable should be put aside by any who wish to understand Horace.
There isno connexion between the two odes, except that the title, which belongs tothis,
has been borrowed for the other, and there is no reason ιο suppose that Horace, writing
at his farm, had any other than an imaginary Tyndaris, with an imaginary Cyrus, iu
his mind.

ARGUMEN T.

Tyndaris, often doth Pan leave Lycaeus ιο visit Lucretilis, protecting my flocks from
sun and wind3 my goats go unharmed and fear not snake or wolf when his sweet
pipe· sounds in the vale of Ustica. The gods love me for my piety and my muse.
Here Plenty awaits thee 3 here shalt thou retire from the heat and sing of the loves
of Penelope and Circe for Ulysscs. Here thou shalt quaff mild Lesbian in the shadc,
nor shall strife be mingled with the cup, nor shalt thou fear the jealous Cyrus, lest he
lay his violent hand upon thee.

VELox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam
Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventos.
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos 5
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti,
Nec virides metuunt colubras

Nec Martiales Haediliae lup08,

1. Lucretilem] ‘ Mons Lucretilis ’ is here and there show themselves, thinks he

identified by De Chaupy and others with
the lofty mountain (or range) called Monte
Gennaro, that overhangs the valley of the
Licenza—Horace's Digentia (Epp. i. 18.
104),—in which his estate lay. De Chaupy
gives a very agreeable account of the
scenery, to show that it was “un sejour
plein d’attraits pour le Dieu Pan? a place
to which Faunus might well resort from his
Arcadian home Lycaeus. Ustica, the Scho-
liasts say, was a mountain or a mountain
and valley. Acron favours the latter, inter-
preting ‘cubantis’ by ‘depressae.' Porphy-
rion, on the other hand, and Comm. Cruq.
refer the epithet ‘.ad resupinam regionem
ejus.' De Chaupy, who illustrates ‘per-
sonuere saxa ’ by the echoes he himself
heard on the spot, which hc identifies with
Horace's estate, and the bare rocks that

can also fix upon this spot Ustica on the
slope of the hills, and he therefore does not
allow Acron's interpretation of ‘ cubantis?
The construction with ‘ muto‚’ ‘pei-muto?
by which the remoter object becomes the
nearer, is not peculiar to Horace, and it
occurs several times in his works. Virg-
Georg. i. 8: “ Chaoniam pingui glandem
mutavit arista.” Ἀλλάσσειν, ἀμείβειν
also admit of this double construction,
sometimes thc thing given in exchange
being in the accusative, sometimes the
thing taken. See Heindorf on S. ii. ’1.

3. 14, and Virg. Eclog. vii. 47 : “solstitium
