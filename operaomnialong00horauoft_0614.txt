HORATII FLACCI

Ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam.

I nuno, argentum et marmor vetus aeraque et artes
Suspice, cum gemmis Tyrios mirare colores 3
Gaude quod spectant oculi te mille loquentem

Navus mane forum et vespertinus pete tectum,

20

Ne plus frumenti dotalibus emetat agris

Mutus et, indignum quod sit, pejoribus ortus
Hic tibi sit potius quam tu mirabilis illi.
Quidquid sub terra est in apricum proferet aetas5

Defodiet condetque nitentia.

Cum bene notum

Porticus Agrippae 'et via te conspexerit Appi,

that excitement is to be avoided in the pur-
suit of the chief good as well of subordinate
goods. But, by saying that virtue itself
may be admired inordinately, he is able to
,introduce with more contemptuous force
the vulgar obj ects of admiration that follow,
respecting which sce C. iv. 8. 23 S. i. 4.
28 3 ii. 3. 118 3 and other places in the
Satires.

[17. I nunc] Comp. Epp. ii. 2. 76.—
‘argentum' &c. = plate, bronzes, and works
of art (O. iv. 8. 5). Comp. Juv. S. i. ¹76.]

[20. Navus] The best MSS. ε but some
MSS. have ‘gnavus,' the genuine and com-
plete form. Cicero says (Orat. c. 47) that
‘ noti,’ ‘navi' ‘ nari ' were used, though
‘ignoti‚' ‘ ignavi‚’ ‘ignari’ wore written.]

21. dotalibus emetat ayris] This is
equivalent to ‘ metat ex agris dotalibus,'
as in S. ii. 2. 105 he says ‘ emetiris acervofl‘
‘Emeto’ is not used elsewhere. Though
the name Mutus occurs in inscriptions, it
is perhaps used here by way of opposition
to the eloquent man who by his own exer-
tions was running an unequal race with the
other man's luck. According to most
modern commentators ‘indignum’ is used
absolutely as an exclamation, and ‘ quod sit
pejoribus ortus' explains why it was a
shame. Mutus had been made rich by a
fortunate marriage, and it was a shalne that
the orator should be obliged to look up to
him as he must because he was rich. Ι take
‘indignum quod sit ' together, as Torren-
tius does in his notes, though 110 edits
‘Mucius indignun1‚' which is the reading
of some of the old editions and of Lam-
binus, Cruquius, and others. Bentley pre-
fers, though be does not edit, · qui sit,' for
which there is no authority.

24. Quidquid sub terra est] This is like
Sophocles (Aj. 646) z

ἅπανθ’ ὁ μακρὸς κᾶναρίθμητος χρόνος
φύει τ’ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται.

‘ In apricum' means ‘to the rays of the
sun‚' ‘to the light of day? A man need
not be in such a hurry to make himself a
name, since time will swallow it up, while
it brings forward the obscure.

26. Porticus Ayrippae] ln A.U.c. '729
Agrippa built the Pantheon in the Cam·
pus Martius, to which a ‘ porticus ’ was
attached. He also built in the same year,
in commemoration of the naval victories of
Augustus, a porticus, to which he gave the
name Porticus Argonautarum. It was not
far from the Via Flaminia, on the site of
the modern Piazza di Pietra (N ordini ap.
Cramer). It was dedicated to Neptune,
and contained a paintiug of the Argonauta.
Μαι-11111 refers to it (iii. 20) :—

“ Hinc si recessit, porticum terit templi,
An spatia carpit lentus Argonautarum Ρ
Α11 delicatae sole rursus Europae ”—

where ‘ templi’ probably refers to the Pan·
theon. He refers to the second again (xi.
1) among several ‘ porticus: those of
Quirinus, Pompeius, and Europa :—

“ Vicini pete porticum Quirini3
Turbam non habet otiosiorem
Pompeius, vel Agenoris puella,

Vel primae dominus levis carinae ;”

that is, Jason. Which of the two is re-
ferred to by Horace it is impossible to say.
Estre (p. 408) thinks neither, but that of
Europa referred to in both the above pas-
sages of Martial (and inii. 14), which was
built by Polla, Agrippa's sister, and-which
is mentioned by Dion Cass- (55. 8.) But
this was not finished till Horace was dead.

. 0110 of the others is more probably referred

to, and of these 1110 Porticus Argonauta-
rum is more likely to have been called
‘porticus Agrippae! (Dion Cass. 53. 27.)
