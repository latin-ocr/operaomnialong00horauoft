-boeg’ and therefore some have p,roposed
mm tothe MSS„ to adop t‘ palumbis’

ι ‘'columbus ‘·ba,' are the ge-
neneterms for pigeonsff— Damae' isboth
muculine and feminine. Georg3 iii. 539:
“timidi damae cervique

11. umecta] ‘sibi et terris’ adds
Lambinus. But ‘sibi’ is not wanted.
Virgil uses the word (Aen. xi. 625)ss

e superjacit undam.'’

13. fluum] This common epithet of
the'l'iber arose outof the quantity of saud
mhed down the stream. Aen. vii. 31:
“ Vorticibus rapidis et multa flavus areni?
It has been argued from ‘vidimus’ that
Horace wrote of what he had seen, and
therefore the prodigies could not be those
at (laesar's death. But he means that
his generation had seen the prodigies he
orffa! to, as Virgil says of the eruptions

‘⁶ Quoties Cyclopum effervere‘ ιιι agros
Vidimus undantem ruptis fornacibus
Aetnam! '.—Georg i. 471.

13, 14. retortis Εὔιον-ε Etrusco violenter
undis] “its waters driven violently back
from its mouth at the shore of the Etrus-
can sea.'’ So 1 am inclined to take it, with
Orelli, Dillenbr„ and others. Some take
⁸ Littore Etrusoe’ for the Etruscan or right
bank of the river, as opposed to ‘ sinistra
affi- 1⁸>2h2323t33’w122f2231222
metlfor ‘littus' by Horace (C. iii. 27.24).
But ‘littus Etruscum ' means the shore of
the Etruscan sea in Carm. Saec- 38, Epod.
xvi. 40, and ‘retortis’ can only signify
driven back, and that must be from the
mouth. Moreover the notion of the reflux
of the river seems to have been common.
12·oe remarks that the overflowings of the
'l'iber are still by the common peop p-leac
counted for by the violence of the sea

driving beck the stream. That this is an
old opinion we leam from the statement
of Seneca, quoted by Mitsch„ ω the effect
that a river suddenly overflows its hanks‚
“si crebrioribus ventis ostium caeditur et
reverberatus fluctu amnis restitit ς qui
crescere videtur quia non effunditur.'’
(Nat. Quaest. iii. 26. 1.)

15. monumenta regis] This signifies the
palace of Numa adjoining the temple of
Vesta, hence called ‘ atrium regium ' (Liv.
xxvi. 27). as forming ι kind of ‘ atrium ’ ιο
the temple. Ovid (Fasti, vi. 263) thus
alludes ιο this building :—

“Hie locus exiguus, qui sustinet atria

Τιῑιιῗῗιξι intonsi regia magna Numae ;'’
which he varies 'a little elsewhere (Trist.
iii. 1. 29, sq.) ε

“Hic locus est Vestae qui Pallada servat
et ignem :

Hic fuit antiqui regia parva Numae?
Fen says that the church of Sta. Maria
Liberatrice stands on this spot, and that
it is pmved by certain inscriptions of the
Vestal Virgins found there in the beginning
of the fisteenth century

17. Iliae—ultorem] 'Piber is repre·
sented as taking upon himself without the
sanction of Jove, and in consequence of
Ilia's complaints, to avenge the death of
C. Julius Caesar, the descendant of Iulus.
Ilia or Rea Silvia (as Niebuhr says the
nar'ne is to be written, and not Rhea)
was said by Ennius, according ιο the
Scholiast Porphyrion, to have been thrown
into the Tiber by command of Amulius,
and for this reason she is re presented as
married to that river ,though she had been
previously betrothed to the Διιίο, ιο whom
Ovid marrioe hex-(Amor. iii. 6. 45, sqq„
beautiful passage). Silius (xii. 543) makes ,
Ilia hide herself' m the bosom of her sponse
