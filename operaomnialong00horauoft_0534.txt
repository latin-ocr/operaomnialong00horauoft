HORATII FLACCI

Quaecunque immundis fervent allata popinis.

Est operae pretium duplicis pernoscere juris

Naturam. Simplex e dulci constat olivo,

Quod pingui miscere mero muriaque decebit, 65
Non alia quam qua Byzantia putuit orca.

Hoc ubi confusum sectis inferbuit herbis

Corycioque croco sparsum stetit, insuper addes

Pressa Venafranae quod baca remisit olivae.

Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia succo; 70

Nam facie praestant.

Venucula convenit ollis;

Rectius Albanam fumo duraveris uvam.
Hanc ego cum malis, ego faecem primus et allec,

some MSS„ including all those of the
Royal Library at Paris collated by Pottier,
probably arose out of the word ‘ inmorsus‚’

62. immabi-s· fervent allata popinis]
The ‘ popinae ’ were the lowest sort of
eating-houses‚ where meat was cooked and

, usually eaten on the premises, but some-

times sent out. They were the same as
the Greek καπηλεῖα. They were a lower
sort of ‘cauponae’ (S. i. 5. 2 n.). Their
keepers, ‘popae‚’ were, as might be ex-
pected, usually persons of no credit (“ mi-
rabar tamen credi popae,'’ Cic. pro Mil. 24).
The shops were dirty, and the company
very low. Compare Epp. i. 14. 21. There
were great numbers of these shops about
the city3 whence Martial says, in speaking
of the improvement of the streets (vii. 61)=

“Stringitur in densa nec caeca novacula
turba:
Occupat aut totas nigra popina vias.
Tonsor, caupo, coquus, lanius sua limina
servant.
Nunc Roma est, olim magna taberna
fuit.”

The ‘popinae’ were called ‘thermopolia’
by Plautus, because there the Romans
drank hot spiced wine and water, ‘calda.’
Becker (Gallus, 272) says there was no
difference between a ‘popina' and ‘ther-
mopolium.’

63. duplicis pernoscere juris] Catius
goes on to describe the sauces, of which
there are two kinds: one which he calls
simple, but which was not entirely so,
being made of sweet 011ve oil mixed with
rich wine and ‘muria‚' which is not, as
Comm. Cruq. says, salt water, but ‘garum,'
made from certain shell-fish (S. 8. 53).
There was a composite sauce which was

made up of the above boiled with chopped
herbs, with a sprinkling of suffr-on, and,
when it had stood to cool, the finest olive
oil of Venafrum (C. ii. 6. 16 n.).

66. Byzantia putuit orca] The ‘thyn-
nus' from which the best ‘garum’ was
made was found best in the neighbourhood
of Byzantium (Pliny ix. 20). ‘ Orca’ is a

jar used for preserving sauces and pickles.

Suidas derives it from an Aeolio word
ὄρχη e ὅρχαι κεράμινα ἀγγεῖα §woeserma
ταρίχων. See Bentley's note and For-cell.
Nearly every known MS. has ⁸ putuit?
Lambinus and Torrentius and many of the
old editions have ‘ putruit’ (S. 3. 194 n.).
The ‘crocus' of Mons Corycus in Cilicia
was most celebrated (Pliny xxi. 17).
‘Stetit' Comm. Cruq. explains “cessavit
agitare, fervere-’³

70. Picenis cedunt pomis Rom-tia] The
apples of Tibur and Picenum are referred
to, C. i. ’7. 143 S. ii. 3. 272.

71. Venucula convenit ollis] This grape
derives its name, Comm. Cruq. says, from
Venusia, which is very doubtful. The
word is variously written. Pliny says (xiv.
c. 2. 6), “ Veniculam inter optime deflores-
centes et ollis aptissimam Campani malunt
sirculam vocare ; alii staeulam? Columella
also (iii. 2. 2, xii. 45) speaks of grapes pre-
served in jars for the winter. Pliny (xiv.
3) says “aliis gratiam, qui et vinis, fumus
affert fabrilis.’' For drying in this way
Catius says the grape of the Alban hills is
best.

73. Hanc ego cum malis] Catius says
he was the first to introduce Alban raisins
at the second course, and likewise ‘ faex’
and ‘allec,' two pickles, as it would seem,
but Forcellini makes them the same, being·
the lees of the ‘muria’ (v. 63 n.). So Pliny
describes ⁶ alec‚' or ¹ alex ’ as it is otherwise
written. Speaking of ‘garum‚' he says,
