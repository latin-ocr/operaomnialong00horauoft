CARMINUM IV. 5.

Dlvis orte bonis, optime Romulae
Custos gentis, abes jam nimium diu ς
Maturum reditum pollicitus patrum
Sancto coneilio redi.
Lucem redde tuae, dux bone, patriae, ⁵
Instar veris enim vultus ubi tuus
Affulsit populo, gratior it diae
Et soles melius nitent.
Ut mater juvenem, quem Notus invido
Flatu Carpathii trans maris aequora ιο
Cunctantem spatio longius annuo
Dulci distinet a domo,
Votis ominibusque et precibus vocat,
Curvo nee faeiem litore demovet:
Sic desideriis icta fidelibus 15
Quaerit patria Caesarem.
Tutus bos etenim rura perambulat,
Nutrit rura Ceres almaque Faustitas,
Pacatum volitant per mare navitae,
Culpari metuit Fides, , 20
Nullis polluitur easta domus stupris,
Mos et lex maculosum edomuit nefas,
Laudantur simili prole puerperae,
Culpam poena premit eomes.

The .‘ curvo litore' is the shore hollowed

‘scoops’ by Newman. ‘ If the Calabrian

18.] Nutrit rura] Bentley introduces
‘ farra‚’ and Tan. Faber substitutes ‘ prata ’
in the former line to avoid the repetition
of ‘rura.’ Cunningham proposes ‘culta ;’
but the repetition is plainly doeigned. ‘ The
ox wanders in security over the fields, to
the fields Ceroe gives fertility. Nothing
could be less probable than Bentley’s con-
jecture, and his reasoning is worse than his
correction. Τὴε difficulty only lies in this

Silius (xii. 375) speaks of “ Arva Cereris
