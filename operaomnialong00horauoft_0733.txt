 

Q. HORATII FLACCI

DE ARTE POETICA

LIBER.

 

Tun: is uo sufficient interual evidence of the time when this poem was written or
off the persons to whom it is addressed. They are three in number, a father and two
sons. Porphyrion aud Comm. Cruq. say that the father is L. Calpurnius Piso Caeso-
ninus, who was Praefectus Urbi under Tiberius (Tac. Anu. vi. 10). If this be so, as he
was born in A.u.c. 705, and had at this time a son verging at least on manhood (for
to no other would this sort of instruction be addressed ς see v. 366), the poem must
have been written very shortly before the death of Horace, A.u.c. 746. Orelli and
Kirehner‚ and many others, take this view of the date. Esne, Franke, and many
before them, put it earlier, and in that case a different Piso must be assumed. The
person supposed by the advocates of au earlier «late is Cn. Calpurnius Piso, who
belonged to the party of Brutus and cassim, and fought together with Horace at
Philippi. He had a son who was eonsul A.U.c. 747, and if he was the youth referred
to, the Ars Poetiea must have been written a good many years before. But the question
is one it is impossible to decide, and nothing turns upon it for the andex-standing of the
poem, which, like many others, might be addressed to any body3 though 1 do not agree
with those who suppose Horace had no particular persons in mind. The Pisones above
referred to are numbered 8, 22, 23, in the Dict. Biog.

As to the purpose of the poem I have tried to help the reader in judging for himself
byn «amful division of the Argument. It will be seen that the rules are miscellaneous
and have little or no method, and that the history of Poetry which Horace gives is
more fanciful than real. It is impossible to look upon it as a finished poem. We are
carried from precept to history, and from one sort of poetry to another without
warning ; and though a general connexion may be traced between the principles of one
kind and those of another, no pains are taken to separate the rules that belougto each.
The rulee and history of the Drama are chiefly dwelt upon, with what particular
bearing upon Roman poetry it is not easy to see. Much that is said can have no refer-
enee to it at all, and could afford no instruction to a Roman. Τὴε observations on
this subject are interrupted now and then by irrelevant observations, and on the whole
there can be little doubt either that the Ars Poetiea was published aster Horace's
death, out of fragments clumsily put together, or that he published it himself in this
can-eleas way from that habitual indolence which prevented his ever producing a com·
plete work of any length, and which is seen in the abruptness with which several of
his piecea are brought to a close. Attempts have been made to re-arrange the mate-
rials so as to form a perfect whole, but the means of doing so do not exist. The place
now invarinbly assigned to the Ars Poetica was fax-st given it by Η. Stephens. In the Δ
MSS. and earlier editions it is inserted before the Satires. Some editors trent it ns a
