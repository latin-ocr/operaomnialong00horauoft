by Livy (ἰ. 54). Dionysius Halicarn. (iv.

the t'wo nations became one (Livy ι. 13).

26. Pontificum libros] These are men-

uua

tioned by Cicero (de Or. i. 43). Τὶιο Col-
lege of Pontiffs had books containing the
rcgulations by which they were guided‚
and all matters pertaining to their office
and the worship of the gods, the general
supervision of which was their principal
duty. The original books were, according
to tradition, given to them by Numa at
their first creation3 but they were added
to from time to time, and they must have
been numerous when Horace wrote. Some
parts were no doubt very antiquated in ex-
pression and ideas.

26. annom volumina vatam] Suetonius
says of Augustus (c. 31) that aster he be-
came Pontifex Maximus, “ quiequid fatidi-
corum librorum Graeci latinique generis,
nullis vel m idoneis auctoribus
ferebatur, supra duo millia contractu undi-
que cremavit3 ac solos retinuit Sibyllinos:
hos quoque delectu habito ς condiditque
duobus forulis auratis sub Palatini Apollinis
basi.'’ Augustus did not succeed to the
office of Pontifex Maximus till aster the
death of Lepidus in Lme- 741. Porphy-
¹¹32.,‘i2¹1;¹'¹2³;¹t⁸1.¹⁵¹22t ‘sii'ffissufi ¹ θ’.. ῗῗὲῗ
mina ’ of Marcius, or the Marcii, were old
writings in a prophetie strain and half me·
trieal form, of which Livy has quoted two

specimens (xxv. 12), but not apparently
with all the archaisms complete. Accord-
ing to Suetonius, Angustus burnt all books
of this sort except the ‘ Sibyllini libri,’ as
they were called, which were written in
Greek. But Servius (on Aen. vi. 72) says
that along with those books were preserved
the books of Marcius. Other prophetie
books were kept in the Capitol, such as

“the Etruscan prophecies of the nymph
Begoe, and those of Albuna or Albunea of
'ribai-(CAJ. 12). These were all books
of fate, aud every Etruscan city seems to
have such” (Niebuhr i. 507).
Niebuhr (i. 259 n. ) thinks that Horace may
be alluding to the old historical lays
from which the history of the Roman kings
has been forg ed, as well as to prophetical
books like those of the Marcii, which Nie-
buhr says,‘ ‘in spite of his contemptuous
glauce at them, were extremely poetiml.
of this,'’ says he, “ we may judge even from
the preserved by Livy. W'e must
not let Horace determine our opinion οιι
these poems any more than on Plautus?
