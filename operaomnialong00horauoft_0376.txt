HORATII FLACCI

Inguen ad obscoenum subductis usque facetus3
Pastillos Ruffllus olet, Gargonius hircum.

Nil medium est.

Sunt qui nolint tetigisse nisi illas

Quarum subsuta talos tegat instita veste;

Contra alius nullam nisi olenti in fornice stantem.

Quidam notus homo cum exiret fornice, “ Macte
Virtute estoj' inquit sententia dia Catonis.
Nam simul ac venas inflavit tetra libido,

Huc juvenes aequum est descendere, non alienas

Cicero charges Verres with the same effe-
minacy: “Quum iste cum pallio purpureo
talarique tunica versaretur in conviviis
muliebribus, non offendebantur homines”

(Act. ii. 5. 12). A great deal has been
written upon the identification of Maecenas
with this person (whatever the name may
have been), and of Agrippa with the oppo-
site character in the next verse. But either
notion appears to me equally improbable.
See Introduction. The idea of Maecenas
being the strutting coxcomb of Horace’s
ι Satire is incredible (see v. 64). The tunic
was worn down to a little below the knees
by civilians not entitled to wear the ‘latus
clavus ι’ women wore it down to the ancles:
military officers not so low as the knee
(Quintil. xi. 3. 138). ‘Facetus’ is what
we might call ‘fine’ [or a fine feIlow, as
he thinks: Krii ger. ] Plautus applies it
to dining as Hor-{ce to dressing (Mostellss 1.

“N-on omnes possunt olere unguenta exotica
ξῆιθξιῗιὲζῗιιι facetis quam tu vivis victibus.''

27. Pastillos Rufillus olet] ‘ Pastillus '
is a diminutive of ‘paniS‚' and signifies a
small roll; whence in a derived sense it
means small balls of something 'sweet.
Horace quotes this verse of his own in S.
4. 92 of this book, as showing the harmless
quality of his satire. Who Rufillus and
Garg onius (which name appears as Gorgo-
nius in the old editions) may have been we
cannot tell. ssat they were persons of
some note Orelli infers from the fact that
Horace’s ridicule of them had made him
enemies, as appears from the passage quoted
above from the fourth Satire. But it does
not appear thatin that place Horace means
more than to illustrate the inoffensive cha-
racter of his satirical writings, nor can
Orelli’s inference 1 think be sustained.
Rufillus is probably only a diminutive of
the common name Rufus, invented for this

fop, though we meet with the name Rufina
in Tacitus (Ann. iii. 36). -

29. Quarum subsuta] The ordinary
dress of the Roman ladies was an under
tunic without sleeves, called ‘intusium ς’
over this they wore another tunic called
‘ stola‚' at the bottom of which ran a
flounce, ‘ instita? called by one of the-Scho-
liasts (Com. Cruq.) ‘tenuissima fasciola’
(which descrIption of its width, however,
has been disputed. See Becker’s Gallus,
Exc. ‘on ‘the dress of the women ’). The
‘ stola' was longer than the wearer, and
after forming several folds under the breast
fell to the feet. ‘ Instita veste subsuta’ is,
a ‘vestis cui subsuta est instita ;’ [and as
Kriiger says, is a like construction to ‘ tog-a
praetexta.'] The same Scholiast says the
‘ instita’ was called by the Greeks περιπέ-
διλον. Out of doors the women wore a

‘palla' corresponding to the male ‘toga.'
See S. 8. 23 n.

31. Macte virtute esto] In this phrase
(for examples of which see Forcell.)
‘macte,' the vocative of ‘mactus ' (‘ magis
auctus'), is 'put where the nominative would
be more regular, and ‘ virtute’ is the abla-
tive of the means. [As in Cicero's ex-
pressiori ‘filio auctus. '] ‘May thy virtue
prosper theel’ (see Key' s 12. G. 1004).

‘Sententia dia Catonis' is equivalent to
‘Cato divine sapiens? Compare S. ii. 1.
72· . “Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia
Laeli‚” and C. i. 3. 36 n. Acron tells this
story: that Cato (the elder) was passing the
door of a brothel, when a. young man (who,

according to Horace, was ‘notus homo,' a ⁷

man of rank or standing in some way) came
out : when he saw Cato he tried to get out
of his way, but the censor called to him ,
and commended him ς’ but afim-warda see-
ing him osten issuing from the same place,
he said‚‘ ‘Adolescensg‚ ego te laudavi tan-

quam interdum huc venires non tauquam
hic habitares. ’' The reason of his com-

mendation is explained in the two next
verses on very loose principles of chastity.
