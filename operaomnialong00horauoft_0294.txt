HORATII FLACCI

Et veteres revocavit artes

‘ Increpuitlyra ’ therefore signifies, ‘checked
me by touching the strings of his lyre, and
leading me to a strain more fitted to my
muse? That Doering, after having given
and adopted this explanation, should have
changed his mind and followed the Scho-
liasts and those after them who join‘ ‘ lyra’
with ‘loqui' is very surprising. [Ritter
does it.] Doering's judgment generally
directed him better than this. In a mat-
ter of taste second thoughts are not often
so good as the first, which are directed by
instinct. The other metaphoris common

. enough. See Virgil (Georg.ii.41): “Pela-

goque volans da vela patenti;'' and Ovid
(Tr. ii. 329) :—

“ Non ideo debet pelago se credere si qua
Audet in exiguo ludere cymba lacu.''

Prop. (iii. 9. 3) :—
“ Quid me scribendi tam vastum mittis in

aequor i>
Non sunt apta meae grandia vela rati.'’

4. Tua, Caesar, aetas] The abruptness
with which this is introduced is worth re·
marking. A longer preface would have
weakened the ode.

5. Fruges et ayris] This is a repetition
of C. iv. 5. 17 sq.

7. Deo-epta] There is the usual conflict
of MSS. between ‘ direpta' and ‘ derepta,’
but see C. iii. 5. 21 n. As the standa-rds
were voluntas-ily sent to Augustus by
Phraates, Horace’s language is somewhat
exaggerated. The recovery (in 7 34, C. i.
26, Introduction, iii. 5) of the standards
lost by Crassus was one of the greatest
causes of rejoicing that ever happened
at Rome. Without it the restoration
effected by Augustus, and of which Horace
here gives a compendious picture, would
have been wanting in one of its chief
features 3 the honour as well as the peace
of Rome was restored. These praises are
repeated from or in (for we cannot say
which was written first) Epp. ii. 1. 255.
See also Epp. i. 18. 56.

9. Janum Quirini] This is the reading

of all the MSS. The usual form appears
to have been ‘J anus Quirinus? as appears,
among other examples, from Suet. (Octav.
c. 22), “ J auum Quirinum—ter clausit ;”
and Macrobius (Sat. i. 9), “ In sacris quo-
que invocamus Janum Geminum, Janum
Patrem, J anum J unonium, Janum Con-
sivium, J ANUM Qummuu, Janum Patul-
cium et Clusivium? There is no instance
I believe of Janum Quirini but this, and
the temple of Janus having been built,
according to tradition, by Numa and not
Romulus, there is much in favour of ‘ Qui-
rinum? All that is against it is the want
of harmony arising out of ‘ um’ thrice re-
peated, and the authority of the MSS„ to
which I yield with some hesitation, Ι admit,
in this case. Bentley’s argument, that if
‘ J anus' could be called ⁸ Janus J nunnius:
he might as properly be styled ‘ J anus
J unonis ς’ and so, if he was rightly eaned
‘J anus Quirinus‚’ therefore he might be
properly called ‘ J anus Quirini: has no
Yfffi'of ss;‡3.32²231¹2¹..55¹2.12”d{.”2533
rinus’ means ‘ J anus called Quirinus,’
which Ι take to be a substantive, and a
ἓῖῗθιὲἱῖἓῖ ἷῗωξίπῖζῖῗ ἓὲἔῖἰῖἓοῗᾞ
former is against history.

10. evaganti] This word appears no-
where else with an accusative case, where-
fore some copyists have changed it into
‘et vaganti,' which is very m . The
most respectable name by which it is snp-
ported is Rutgersius. ‘ Evadere’ and
‘ exire' are used with an accusative re·
peatedly. [Oomp. C. iii. 24. 29, ‘refrenare
licentiam? Horace is here alluding to
some of the J uliae Legem and particularly
to the Lex J ulia de Adulteriis and the Lex
Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus} ‘Artes’
is rightly explained by the Scho iast Acron
by ‘ those virtues in which the discipline of
life is placed, as prudence, justice, forti-
tude,’ and tempemnce.’ Both ‘emovit'
and ‘amovit’ have MS. authority, and
the editors vary in their preference. ‘Emo-
vit’ is the word Horace adopts elsewhere.
