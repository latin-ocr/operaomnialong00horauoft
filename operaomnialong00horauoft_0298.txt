262 HORATII FLACCI

Magnus Annus was generally believed in is certain. Virgil refers to it in his fourth
Eclogue ι “Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo '³ (v. 5), “incipient magni pro-
cedere menses’' (v. 12). Cicero discusses it in his treatise de Nat. Deorum (ii'. 20) ἐ
“ Quarum (i. e. of the planets) ex disparibus motionibus magnum annum mathematici
nominaverunt 3 qui tum efficitur quum solis 01 lunae et quinque errantium ad eandem
inter se comparationem confectis omnium spatiis est facta conversio„ Quae quam longa
sit magna quaestio est. Esse vero certam et definitam necesse est.'’ The statements
of the ancients vary from 49,ΟΟΟ 10 nearly 26‚000 years. The last corresponds to the
period calculated for the precession of the equinoxes, with which, however, the Magnus
Annus of the Greeks and Romans had nothing to do. It is represented on the reverse
of a medal of Hadrian in the form of a man in a loose robe, with a globe aud Phoenix
in his left hand, and his right raised over his head. He is surrounded by an oval ring
to distinguish him from the figures of Eternity‚ represented 111 a circle. The inscrip-
tion is Saeculum Aureum. What amount of credit is due to all the details of Jahn's
explanation, which are derived chiefly from the statements of Servius on the 4th Eclogue
of Virgil and from Censorinus, de Die Natali, I cannot say. But, without resorting to
such explanations as the above, it would have been very surprising if Augustus, having
resolved to celebrate a great festival in honour of his own successful career, had not
made Apollo the principal feature of it, and had called upon Pluto to bless his country,
in preference to that god to whom he allowed himself to be likened and whom his
flatterers assigned to him as his father. Horace appears to have been much pleased at
being chosen as poet-laureate of the occasion (C. iv. 6, Introd.). The ode was sung at
,the most solemn part- of the festival, while the emperor was in person offex-ing sacrifice
at the second hour of the night on the river side upon three altars, attended by the
fifteen men who presided over religious affairs. The chorus consisted of twenty-seven
boys and twenty-seven girls of noble birth, well trained no doubt for the occasion
(C. iv. 6). The effect must have been very beautiful, and no wonder if the impression
on Horace's feelings (for in all probability he was present) was strong and lasting.
Attempts have been made to distinguish the parts assigned to the respective choruses.
But there do not appear to me to be any conclusive or very probable data on which to'
found an accurate division, in which therefore, as might be expected, the editors do not
agree. Ι have endeavoured in the argument to show all the divisions of the ode by its
subjects. In judging of the character of the ode as a poetical composition, it must not
be forgotten that it was written for a peculiar and solemn occasion and to be set to
music, in both which points it differs from most of the other odes of Horace; and, judged
with reference to those objects, it may be pronounced superior to laurfflte odes in
general. For rhythm it appears to me the best of all the Sapphic odes.
