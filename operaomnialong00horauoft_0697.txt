Dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi -
Qui redit in fastos et virtutem aestimat annis,
Miraturque nihil nisi quod Libitina sacravit.

Ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur

Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.

Naevius in manibus non est, et mentibus haeret
Paene recens ? Adeo sanctum est vetus omne poelma.

47. ratione nentis acer-m] This seems
{obe an allusion to what Cicero (de Divinat.
ii. 4) calls entatio acervalis‚’ from
the Greek ampl-ms· (from σωρός, ‘ acervus,'
8 hen p‚) a logical term signifying a series
of propositious linked together an'd depend-
iuml] upon ἷξε olus {³:³spoe attiuha egi:
&magdeb thvd liicst 3ctiiiit it iiidyego on

ever without any conclusion at all.

Persius uses the same illustration (S. vi.

⁷8 sqq.)-

“ Rem duplica. Feci. J am triplex, jam
mihi quarto;
Jupiisgaizllies redit m rugam. Depunge ubi

Iuventus, Chrysippe, tui finitor acervi?

Tne invention ofthe «apim is attributed

to Chrysippus the Stoic. [⁸ Cadat elu-
sus z’ he who takes one grain from 8 heap,
atinieaves a heap ; but if he goes on, the
heap is finally. reduced to nothing, and so
if he should assert that there is always a
Μαι), he is finally confuted by ‘the reckon-

ing of the diminishing heap. ' Thus it ap-

2 pars, as Kriiger sa ys, that such words as

‘great-,³ ‘'smal,l ‘man,’y ‘,'few have 8ο
exact meaning. ]

48. Qui redit in fastos] The word
⁶ fasti: asapplied to records, belonged pro-
perly to the sacred books or tables in which
the ‘fasti’ and ⁶ nefasti dies ' were distin-
guished, that is, the Calendar. When these
were made public (Livy ix. 46) calendars

⁴ became common, and in these (which were

usually engraved 08 tables of stone) re-
markable events were inserted, so that they

*¹ became a source of historical informatiou.

There were also consular annaJS, or registers
of the consuls and other chief magistrates,
‘ kept among the records of the state, and
these were also called‘ fasti, ’ or ‘Raunales
either of which words came, in consequence,
to be used
of any kind,
Horaee ap plies it to the family genealogies
of the hij-mia family. (C. iii. 17. 4.) See

geynerall for historical registers
particularly by the poets.

where it is applied in the most general way
to the history of the world. r

49. Libitina] See S. ii. 6. 19 n.

50. Ennius et sapiens] Ennius was born
at Rudiae, in Calabria, Rc 239. Besides
his great historica} epic poem called Anna-
les, and plays, and satires, he wrote philo-
sophical poems of which the titles of some
and very slender fragments have been pre·
served. He followed the opinions of Pytha-
goras, and in the beginning of his epic
ffimpahsene ᾶῖῗῗέθιέἶξξὲἑὲῗιὲἓῖξὲἳέιῗὲἱὲῗέ
inhabited, among others, that of a
whence Persius says (vi. 10) :—

“ Cor jubet hoc Enni, postquam destertuit
μιξὲἶῗιίᾶεε, Quintus pavone ex Pytha-

* goreo ;‚’

which means that hc had woke up from his
dream of being Homer, and having
through the body of a peacock, he had be-
come Quintus Ennius. He says however
that Ennius need not care what was thought
of his professions and his dreams, since he
was certainly worshipped as if he were 8
second Homer. As to ‘ critici ’ see Epp. i.
19. 40 ιι. Ennius is called ‘ fortis’ not for
his personal bravery (though he saw some
service), but for the boldnoes of his style.

53. Naevius in manibus non est] Cn.
Naevius was born about the middle of the
third century 13.c., and wrote plays and an
epie poem on the first Punic war, in which
he served (Gell. xvii. 21). To this epic.
poem Virgil seems to have owed some of
his ideas. Terence ranks him with Plau-
tus and Ennius as one of his models ; and,
comparing these three with his own con·
temporarias, he says. -

“Quorum aemulari exoptat negligentiam
Potius quam istorum obscuram diligen-
tiam. ” (Prol. Andria, 20sq.)

Naevius was perhaps rather the oldest of

sentence interrogative. A few editors have
