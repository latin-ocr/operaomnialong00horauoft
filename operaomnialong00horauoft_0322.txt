HORATII FLACCI

Horret capillis ut marinus asperis
Echinus aut currens aper.
Abacta nulla Veia conscientia

Ligonibus duris humum

30

Exhauriebat ingemens laboribus,
Quo posset infossus puer
Longo die bis terque mutatae dapis

Inemori spectaculo,

Cum promineret ore quantum exstant aqua

35

Suspensa mento corpora 3
Exsucca uti medulla et aridum jecur

Amoris esset poculum,

“Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere
Canpiiiigmss’

Sagana is there again introduced in her
company (see note).

26. Avernales aquas] So Dido in her

pretended magical ceremony sprinkled
“latices simulatos fontis Averni '' (Aen.
iv. 512 .
. 28. {turrem- aper] Bentley has sub-
stituted ‘Laurens' on the conjecture of
N. Heinsius, and produces of course many
instances iu which Laurentian boars are
mentioned. But the more common he
makes that epithet appear the less pro-
bable it becomes that it would have been
universally overlooked by the copyists and
Scholiasts. As Sagana is represented run-
ning about furiously‚ the rushing of a
boar is not a bad simile. If Bentley had
ever seen a wild hog bursting from a
jungle, and then tumbling along the open
plain faster than dog or rider can follow
him, he would not have quarrelled with
the illustration. The Scholiasta Acron
giveS, either as a comment or a various
reading, ‘ furens?

29. nulla—conscientia] Unconscious
or careless of the horrible suffering the
child was to endure. Though she groaned,
it was only with the labour. We are to
understand that the transaction was going
on, and the grave being dug in the open
court, the ‘ impluvium.'

33. Longo die bis terque]
belongs to ‘ die,’ not to ‘ spectaculo? On
every weary day food was to be put before
him, and changed two or three times, that
his soul might yearn for it like Tantalus,
and its longings might be worked into
the spell that was to inflame the heart
of Varus. ‘Inemori' is not found any
where else. The ordinary form is ‘im-

‘ Longo ’

mori,' which appears in Ven. 1483. ‘ Bis
terque’ signifies ‘frequently 3' as in Mar-
tial (vi. 66) ι

“ Attraxit prope se mauu negantem
Et bis terque quaterque basiavit?

‘ Bis terve' (which was the common read-
ing till Bentley edited the other) means
‘ rarely.’ Bentley is wrong in saying that
all the editions since the fifteenth century
have ‘ ve.' That of Asoensius of 1519 has
‘ que,' and Mancinelli in his commentary
has the same. The Scholiast Porphyrion
so read it.

37. Exsucca] Till Lambinus, ou the
authority of one or two MSS„ introduced
‘ exsucta? the editions all had ‘ exerta' or
‘ exserta? The Scholiasts read ‘exsecta’
which is plainly out of place. There are
more various readings on this word in the
MSS. than on any other in Horace. They
are recapitulated by Fea: ‘exustass ‘ex-
secta,’ ‘ exacta? ‘ extracta,' ‘ exsucta,’
‘ exuta‚’ ‘ exerta‚’ ‘ exhausta‚' ¹ exesa‚’
‘exesta.' He adds ‘exsuccass and adopts
it with Cunningham and Sanadon. Ι find
in the margin of H. Stephens' edition ‘ ex-
acta? Bentley prefers ‘exesa’ ‘Exsucta'
and ‘ exsucca’ appear to me the most
likely readings. The latter is used by
Seneca and Quintilian 3 [but in Seneca,
Ep. 30, Lipsius has ‘ corporis exhausti‚’
not ‘exsucci.’] Juvenal has “ossa vides
regum vacuis exsucta medullis ’⁹ (viii. 90).
If there is any difference, ‘exsucca' seems
better suited to describe the dry state of
the marrow, while the participle ‘ exsucta’
better suits the bones from which the
marrow has been exhausted, as in the
verse of Juvenal. [Ritter has ‘execta’
with this remark, ‘ medulla ex eapite
secta? Keller and Orelli have ‘ ex-
sucta.’]
