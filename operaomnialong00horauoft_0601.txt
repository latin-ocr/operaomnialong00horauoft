EPISTLE HI.

a.u.c. 734.
Ῑιι μισ. ⁷34 au embassy came from Armenia to Rome, expressing the dissutisfoetion

γ of the people with their king Artaxias, and praying that Augustus would place upon

the throne that king's younger brother Tigranes, who was then living at Rome.
Augustus mental, and sent his stepson Tiberius Claudius Nero with Tigranes to de-
throne Artaxias. (Dion. 54, c. 7, 9.) Tiberius did this, and with his own hand crowned
'figi-anes. (Suetonius, nb. c. 9.) This summary proceeding was made the most of at
Bone, though there appears to have b‘een little resistance. There was a medal struck
‘on the occasion, with the inscription “Armenia capta.” Horace speaks (Ep. 12. 26) of
the Armenian having fallen by the valour of Tiberius ς and Velleius says Armenia was
reduced to the power of the Romans. It had been so virtually since the submission
of'l'igranes' grandfather to Cn. Pompeius. [Velleius (ii. 94) says that Tiberius plaoed
Artavasdes on the throne. See the notes in Burmann’s ed.] .

'liberius appears to have had a number of young men with him, such as Titius,
Celsus, and Munatius, mentioned in this Epistle, and Julius Florus, to whom it is
fflressed. What little cau be said about the first three will be found in the notes.

· OsFlorus Porphyrion says, “Fuit satirarum scriptor cujus sunt electae ex Ennio.

Lucilio, Varrone.’' From this Epistle (v. 23) we infer that he was practising to be-
come ancrator or a jurisconsultus, and that he wrote verses of the softer sort, and in
flue second Epintle of the second book (v. 59) we have the same information.

“ Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis 3
Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigr0.''
He may have written Satires, but it would seem firom the last quotation that he had

not written any when Horace sent him that Epistle. If the Scholiast is to be trusted
(and it is not likely he invented what he says), Florus published a selection from the

ἓ old writers mentioned by Porphyrion. Quintium (nm. Orat. x. 3)te11s an aneodote

 

of one Julius Florus, who was uncle ιο an intimate friend of his, Julius Secundus, and
whom he calls “ in eloquentia Galliarum (quoniam ibi demum exercuit eam) princeps.''
This may bc the person Horace addresses, and if so he carried out suoeessfully the pnr-
suit of which Horace here supposes him to be beginning the practice. He is also sup·
posed by Weichert to be the person mentioned by Tacitus (Ann. iii. 40, 42) as the
leader- of an insurrection of the Treviri, which is very improbable. How he got the
gentile name Julius is uncertain. The cognomen Florus belonged to the Aquillia gens 3
andthere was a L. Aquillius Florus, one of the ‘triumviri monetales’ at this time,
seven-al of whose coins are extant. Some of them are given in the Dict. Biog. It is
supposed he received the ‘ civitas ’ from C. Julius Caesar and took his name. But we
know nothing about this. Horace had a great regard for him, as appears not only
