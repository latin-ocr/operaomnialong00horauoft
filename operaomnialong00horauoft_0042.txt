HORATII FLACCI

Seu rupit teretes Marsus aper plagas.

Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium

Dis miscent superis 3 me gelidum nemus 3ο
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori

Secernunt populo, sineque tibias
Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia

Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.

Quod si me lyricis vatibus inseris,

35

Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.

28. teretes] This word Festus describes
to mean ‘long and round as a pole‚’ which
definition will not always help us to the
meaning. It has always more or less
closely the meaning of roundness or
smoothness, or both as here. It contains
the same root as ‘tero,’ ‘tornus,' τείρω,
and its cognate words, and its meaning is
got from the notion of rubbing and polish·
ing. Horace applies it to a woman’s ancles,
a smooth-faced boy, the cords of a net, and
a faultless man (see Index). It is applied
by Ovid (Fast. ii. 318) to a girdle, and by
virgil (Aen. xi. 579) to the thong of a
sling; where, as here, it represents the
exact twisting of a cor-‚d ‘’Sleuder will
not do3 for ‘ plagae' were nets of thick
cord with thich the woods were sur-
rounded, to catch the larger beasts as
they were driven out by dogs and beaterS.
Smart readers the words, “ circling toils;”
Francis, “spx-ending toils;'’ Dacier omits
‘teretes' altogether. [Ritter explains ‘te-
retes' correctly. ‘Teretes plagae’ are
nets, the cords of which are made of a
great number of threads, fitted together,
and fashioned into a round form. But
still we want one word, which shall ex-
press both thick o'r strong and round]
Marsus for Marsicus, as Colchus for Col-
ehicus, Medus for Medicus, and many
others, is the only form Horace uses,

29. Me doctoerum hederae praemia fron
tiam]—‘ Te ’ has been proposed for ‘ me ‚·’
‚and Mr. Tate has declared, that this “true
reading, on necessity arising from internal
evidence against ‘ me ³ and the MSS„ aster
the assent of scholars generally given, may
now take its placeas it were by acclama-
tion.” Orelli says, in opposition to Mr.
Tate, “ conjecturam—jam ab omnibus ex-

plosam esse arbitror? It was originally

Mr. Tate wrote, are Jones and Sanadon.
Other critics have defended it, but very
lamely: and more recently Fea. has adopted
this reading, but on grounds very different
from his predecessors. “ Thou, Maecenas?
he sayS, “art ever occupied in crowning
poets with the ivy, and they in return
exalt thee to the gods in their sougs.
The ivy, which was sacred to Bacchus,
made a fit and usual gai-land for a lyric
poet. “ Doctarum fmntium,'' which Mr.
Tate defends, as applied to Maecenas, is
the proper description of poets, who by
the Greeks were called σοφοί. So ἀοιδοὶ
σοφισταί (Pind. Isth. ii. 36).

34. Lesboum—bwrbiton] The lyre of
Sappho and Alcaeus (C. i. 32. 5).

35. Quod si] A reference to the Index
will show that ‘ quod si ' does not occur, as
Orelli says it does, but rarely inthe poets.

*The MSS. vary between ‘inseris’ and ⁸ in-

seres? The present seems to be more in
keeping with what goes before, and Horace
had no occasion to express a doubt as to
whether Maecenas ranked him among lyric
poeta. Although the personal prououn ‘’tu

is emphatic in this sentence, Horace omits
it, as the poets often do, where no opposi-

tion of persons is intended. Orelli and
Dillenbr. have quoted a fragment of Sap-

pho (15 Bergk), from which it might ap·
pear that the last line was imitatedz but
the reading is so doubtful, that nothing
certain can be made out of it. The idea
will be found frequently in Ovid.-‘ Lyri-
cis ’ is less common than ‘ melicis,' to
describe the lyrie poets of Greeoe.
