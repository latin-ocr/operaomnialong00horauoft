Rufam aut Pusillam appellet fortique marito
Destinet uxorem ; interdicto huic omne adimat jus
Praetor et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos.

Quid si quis gnatam pro muta devovet agna,

Integer est animi? Ne dixeris.

Ergo ubi prava 220

Stultitia hic summa est 1nsania; qui sceleratus,

Et furiosus erit; quem cepit vitrea sama,

Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis,

Nunc age luxuriam et Nomentanum arripe mecum :

Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes.

Hie simlll accepit patrimoni mille talenta,
Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,
Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

have been carried. For full particulars
the render may consult Becker (Gau,
‘Exc. on the Carriages') and Dict. Ant.
The principal points are mentioned in M r.
Long’s note on Cicero, in Verr. ii. 5. 111

“lectica octophoro ferebatur. '’

216. quam aut Pusillam] These names
commonly occur in inscriptions, as Bentley
has shown by quoting several. He [and
Ritter] have Posillam for Pusillam.

217. interdicto huic omne adimat jus]
The law of the XII tables assigned] the
charge of persons who were ‘furiosi' to
their relations in the male line ‘agnati,’
·and the praetor in later times chose the

who should act as ‘fem-ator to the
numne person. The same law applied to

’'‚’ notorious spendthristsp (See
article ‘’em-ator in Dict. Ant„ and below
app: 1. 1, 102 sq.). The story of Sophocles
brought before an Athenian jury by his
Q and reading the celebrated chorus in
hia Oedip us Coloneus, to prove his sanity,
istoldby pCicero' 111 his treatise on OldA g,e
c. 7. ‘Omne jus 'here means every legal
capacity for acting.[1t is possible that
Horace uses ‘interdicto’ as a participle,
but if he did, he misused the word. Ritter
takes it as a participle agreeing with ‘huic,’
and explains it,‘ huic qui bonis interdictus
a praetore est: a bit of Latin which‘ is quite
original. We may relieve Horace of an
imputed blunder by taking‘ interdicto’ as
the ablative. The Commentator must look
aster himself. ]

221. Ιιίο summa eet insania] ‘Insania’
signifies unsounduess of mind generally;
‘’furor the same, accompanied with vio-
lence. Horace' s climax of madmen’ ιε the
fool, the man of crime, and the ambitious,

the worst of all. [As to ‘ prava stultitia ’

see v. 113 n.]
222. vitrea] “Aut fragilis aut splen-
dida” (Porph.). It probably means the

latter, the
20, where the epithet is applied to Circe,

glitter of fame. See C. i. 17.

‘but probably only as it is applied to ‘pont0‚'

in C. iv. 2. 3, 111 the sense of ‘cam-ula: as
υάλινος is used in Greek.

ἥ 223. Hunc circumtonuit] This verse,
which has a grand Epic tone, Orelli thinks
may be taken from Ennius. But Horace
may have written it himself. He resorts
occasionally to travestie to heighten the
force of his satire. The worst stage of
insanity is represented by one whom Bel-
lona hovers round with a trumpet of
thunder and her bloody scourge, and urges
on to madness, as she drove the Roman
soldiers, according to Silius’ description of
the battle of the Trasimenus (v. 220).
The mad rites of the Bellonarii‚ the priests
of this goddess, who cut their own flesh to
offer the blood in sacrifice, are mentioned
by Lucan (i. 565).

rI'um quos sectis Bellona lacertis
Saeva movet cecinere deos,’

and there appear to have been impostors
who, professing to be inspircd by Bellona,
disturbed the peace of the city with their
eries. Martia] mentions them among the
nuisances ofa town life (xii. 57. 11) ε “Nec
turba cessat entheata Bellonae.”

225. Vincet enim stultos ratio] S. i. 3.
105 11. As to ‘talenta‚’ see S. 7. 89.

228. Tusci {urba impia vici] The Vicus
Tuscus was south of the Forum, and lead-
ing from the Forum along the bottom of
the Mons Palatinus on the west into the
Velabrum, which was the name of that part
