xxx INTRODUCTION.

C. i. 3 .—This is another of the Asclepiadean metres, consisting of ’
two verses alternating thus:

—zl-uul-uc
--Ι-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υσ

The first of these verses is called after Glycon, a poet whose age and
birthplace are unknown. The second verse is the same as C. i. 1. To
this metre also belong C. i. 13. 19. 363 iii. 9. 15. 19. 24, 25. 28;
iv. 1. 3.

C. i. 4.-—This met-re has its name from Archilochus of Paros. It
consists of alternate verses, of which the first is one of those that the
grammat-iaus call ἀσυνάρτητοι ⁸, because they consist of different mea-
sures which do not blend together. The first four feet are those of an
hexameter verse, after which follow three trochees, the first part being
always distinct from the second. The second is a catalectic iambic
trimeter, that is, it has one syllable wanting in the last foot. There is

no ⁴other Ode-in this metre.

C. i. 5.—This is also reckoned with the Asclepiadean metres, though
only the two first lines have their name from Asclepiades, being the
same as C. 1. The third is called after Pherecrates, the comic poet of
Athens. It consists of a dactyl between two spondees, if my ear does
not deceive me ; but·it is usual to mark it with a spondee, choriambus,
and long syllable. The fourth is the Glyconeau verse, which occurs in
C. 3. To this metre belong C. i. 14, 21, 23; iii. 7, 133 iv. 13.

and perhaps in the line of Horace:
⁴ Quindecim Di'ana preces virorum?

If Horace has generally avoided this form of the verse, the dislike seems to have been
diminished as his ear improved 3 so that while there is but one instance of such a
caesura in the second book of the Carmina, and not one in the third, there are no less
than twenty-two in the fourth, and in the carm. Saec. one on an average in every stanza.
Nay, even in such lines as ‘ Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae’ we prefer the double
trochee accent at the commencement to that which Dr. Carey considers so sweet, who
virtually makes ‘ chorus ’ a trochee‚ and would, we suppose, give the sound of a dactyl to
Romulae in ‘ Romulae genti date remque prolem 1 que Et decus omne.’ If any one will
read over the C. S. with the accent we contend for, he will readily pereeive the beauty
of the metre, and cease to wonder that Sappho and Catullus hesitated not to make the
fourth syllable short. In particular much beauty will be added to the line ‘ J am Fides
et Pax et Honos Pudorque? According to Dr. Carey's notion of a metrieal acoent, ’
‘ Pax ' will lose all emphasis.”

⁸ πρῶτος ἆσυναρτήτοις Ἀρχίλοχος κέχρηται (Hephaestion, p. 48, ap. Bentley on
Epod. ii.). The Scholiast on Hephaestion, p. 52, says there were no less than sixty-four
metres of this sort used by the Greeks.
