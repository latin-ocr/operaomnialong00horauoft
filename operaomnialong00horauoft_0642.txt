606 HORATII FLACCI

Fidenis vicus 3 tamen illic vivere vellem,

Oblitusque meorum obliviscendus et illis

Neptunum procul e terra spectare furentem. ¹ ’ 'io ’
Sed neque qui Capua Romam petit imbre lutoque

Adspersus volet in caupona vivere ,· nec qui

Frigus collegit furnos et balnea laudat

Ut fortunatam plene praestantia vitam.

Nec si te validus jactaverit Auster in alto, 15
Idcirco navem trans Aegaeum mare vendas,

Virgil mentions them together as colonies
of Alba (Aen. vi. ¹773) :—-

“ Ηί tibi Nomentum, et Gabios, urbemque
Fidenam,
Hi Collatinas imponent montibus arces ;”

where it may be obser-ved Virgil shortens
the first syllable, whereas Horace, Juvenal
and Silius (xv. 91) make it long.

8. tamen illic vivere vellem] There is a.
good deal of difficulty in respect to the
connexion and meaning of this passage

’ and the next. Horace seems to mean that
though Lebedus was a place deserted, he
could enjoy living there, though it cut
him off from all his friends, for the sake
of the fine prospect of the sca, which
would be an exaggerated way of speaking.
He had probably in mind some occasion
when he had admired the sea from Lebe-
dus, aud the recollection came upon him
strongly as he wrote; or Bullatius may
have said something in a letter about the
fine prospect, and Horace means that he
agrees with him. [Horace says, if it had
been necessary, he could have been content
to dwell in this lonely place and to gaze
on the stormy sea ; for there was nothing
else to look at. Ritter has rightly con-
ceived the meaning: ‘poeta hoc exemplo
planum facere voluit, minimum ad beate
vivendum momentum in loco esse, non
'magnum in amicis et cognatis, maximum
in suo cujusque animo.'] But, he says,
there is a time for all things. The tra-
veller, when he is splashed, may be glad
of a tavern to retire to and clean himself,
but he would not wish to stay there all
his life 3 and the man who has got chilled
may be glad of a fire or hot bath, but he
does not reckon fires and hot baths the
chief good of life; and though you may
have been glad to get on shore in a foreign
land to escape from a stoi-m, you will
surely not think it necessary to stay there
for ever. If a man is in health‚ Rhodes

and Mytilene are not the places for him,
so come back again while you may, and if
you must praise those distant parts, praise
them at home. It appears as if Bullatius
had been a good while absent and meant
to remain much longer.

11. qui Capua Romam] The road Ap-
pius made (A.U.c. 442) extended only as
far as Capua. It was afterwards extended
to Beneventum, and thence by two diffe-
rent branches to Brundusium, according
to the general opinion, which however has
been disputed (S. i. 5. 79, n.). The road,
of which a description is given by Proco-
pius (de Bell. Goth. i. 14) from his own
observations‚ was formed of blocks of
basaltic stone very compactly put together

without mortar or clamps, or metal of any ’

sort. Whether there was originally gravel
laid over the pavement or not is uncertain ς
but when it was worn by traffic, a coat
of gravel may have been given it. Cer-
tainly gravel is mentioned in the iuscrip-
tion quoted on S. i. 5. 6, and Horace's
account of the traveller coming in splashed
with mud leads to the same conclusion.
The pavement is now generally covered
with gravel, and “when it is uncovered,
as at capo di Bove, at Fondi, &c., the
stones, though irregular, are large and
flat, but their edges being worn into
hollows, they jolt a carriage unmercifully”
(Forsyth's Italy, p. 133). This confirma
the interpretation given to the verse last
referred to.

12. nec qui frique collegit] The mean·
ing is plain enough: he who has got
chilled, not he who has caught the agne,
as some say. Obbarius quotes Ovid (Met.
i. 234): “ ab ipso Colligit os rabiem ;'’
[and Kriiger quotes Ovid Met. v. 446:
‘ Fessa labore sitim collegerat.’] ‘ Furnos’
may be bakers’ ovens or any furnaces to
which a man might go to warm himself.
As to the ‘ balnea,' see Dict. Ant.
