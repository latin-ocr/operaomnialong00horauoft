because they were not watched as the rich
man's were. ‘ Novendiales' usually signi-
fies ‘of nine days' continuance,' but in can-
not have that meaning here. Hector was
buried after nine days (11. xxiv. 784) t

'‘aluredi” ἄρ’ ἐξέφερον θρασὺν ’Ἕκτορα
δακρνχέοντες.

‘ Obsoleta ’ is applied in an unusual sense.
It usually signifies that which is gone to
decay (out of use), as clothes, houses, faded
pictures, dcc, and so it comes to mean ge-
nerally that which is spoilt and worthless.
See C. ii. 10. 6.

50.] Tumque venter Pactumeius] In
Epod. v. 5 it is insinuated that Canidia is
childless, that the children she pretends to
have are not hers, and her childbirths are
a fiction, perhaps to extract money from
her lovers on whom her pretended children
were affiliated. Here the libel is withdrawn,
but in such a way as to leave it untouched,
for in the last linc he insinuates that her
travail is at least not very difficult. ‘ Ven-
ter’ is used by the law-writers to signify
the child in the womb, or a woman with
child. (“ De Ventre in Possessionem Mit-
tendo‚” Dig. 37, tit. 9.) Quintilian also
(Declam. 177): “ Illa igitur prior damna-
vit ventrem suum: victurus autern fuit ille
si ego adulteram non occidissem.'' Tacitus
uses ‘uterus' for the child after birth (Ann.
i. 59; xv. 23). The name ‘ Pactumeius '

Fea quotes many more, and defends the
reading strongly. Lambinus adopts it,
Turnebus, Torrentius, Dacier‚ and others
[and Ritter]‚ Ascensius too, much earlier

than any of them. But the Scholiasts
and the editions of the fisteenth century
knew nothing of that word, which is
founded on a filthy notiou, though its de-
fenders think it a elever joke. [Ritter re-
jects this filthy interpretation and explains
Partumeius in his own way.] ‘ Pactu·
meius’ is a Roman name, as Bentley has .
shown from the jurists and inscriptions.
Ven. has ‘ paetum ejus: and that Ι suppose
to be the reading of all the editions de-
scended from the same stock and bearing
Landinus' commentary: but it will neither
scan nor construe, and is only an argument
for ‘ Pactumeius: though Dacier says that
name has “ ni ni sens.”

56. ut tu meris] ‘Ut ’ is an exclamation
of scorn- ‘ To think that you should? It
is generally taken as a question by the edi-
tors, and followed by a note of interroga-
tion. It occurs again (S. ii. 5. 18)= “ Utne
tegam spurco Damae latus ! ’' The festival
in honour of Cotys or Cotytto was ofThra-
cian origin, and transferred to Corinth and
other Greek states with all its impurities.
It found its way into Sicily, whence one of
the priestesses of that goddess eomes to be
mentioned by Theocritus (vi. 40): ταῦτα
γὰρ ἃ ’γραία με Korn-trapis ἑξεδίδαξεν. The
festival was never introduced into the
Italian States, and was unknown at Rome
except to the learned. The rites of this
goddess, like other works of darkness, pro-
fessed secrecy, as Juvenal says (ii. 91) :-

“ Talia secreta coluerunt orgia taeda
Cecropiam solit Baptae lassare Cotytto.''

On the connexion of the title Baptae with
the worship of Cotylam, the reader may
consult Buttmann’s Mythol. vol. ii. art.
