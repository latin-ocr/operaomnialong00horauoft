616 HORATII FLACCI

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea villicus optas 3 15
Me constare mihi scis, et discedere tristem

Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.

Non eadem miramur3 eo disconvenit inter

Meque et te : nam quae deserta et inhospita tesca

Credis amoena vocat mecum qui sentit, et odit ⁴ 20

Quae tu pulchra putas.

Fornix tibi et uncta popina

Incutiunt urbis desiderium, video, et quod

Angulus iste feret piper et tus ocius uva,

Nec vicina subest vinum praebere taberna

Quae possit tibi, nec meretrix tibicina, cujus 25Ἰ
Ad strepitum salias terrae gravis: et tamen urges

14. Τιι mediastinus] See Becker's Gall.
Exc. on the ‘ Slave Famnyss He had been
one of the lowest slaves, used for all
manner of work in the ‘ familia urbana‚'
and by his pitiful countenance (for he was
afraid perhaps to speak) had shown how
much he wished to be delivered from that
¹condition and to be sent to work on the
farm, though that was generally consi-
dered to be the greatest punishment (S. ii.
7. 118 n.). When there he had risen it
may be supposed to be ‘ villicus.' ‘ Medi-
astinus ¹ was the name for the lowest sort
of slave both in the town and country
establislnnent. It is derived, Forcelliui
says, from ‘ medius? from his standing 111
the midst and being at every one’s call.
Porphyrion, on this passage, explains
‘ mediastinus ' to be a ‘ balneator,' one who
attended to the baths, and Priscian, quoted
by Forcellini and Becker (ubi sup.)‚ limits
the name to the bathing slaves. He is
corrected by N ouius (ii. 573, ap. Forcell.) ;
but it is probable that the ‘ balneatores’
were included in the class of slaves called
finediastinil [‘ Etenim multum interest
qualis servus sit . . . an vero vulgaris, vel
mediastinus an qualisqualis? Ulpian. Dig.
47. 10. 15. §44, quoted by Ritten]

19. tesca] Acron says ‘tesca' (or ‘tes-
qua,’ as it is iu Ascensius’ edition of his
text and Porphyrion’s, aud so it appears
in Comm. Cruq.) are “loca deserta et
difficilia? and that it is a Sabine word.
According to the authorities quoted by
Festus it signified also a consecrated
enclosure, and Varro says much the same
(de Ling. Lat. vii. 10). Accius used the
word before Horace, and Lucan aster him
(vi. 41): “Amplexus fines, saltus nemoro-
saque tesca, Et silvas.”

21. For-nix tibi et uncta popina] within
the porticus, which ran round the circus,
were vaulted chambers (‘ fornices '), which
were let out to prostitutes; and in other
parts of the city, under different buildings,
public and private, there were similar
vaults employed in the same way. As to
‘popina ' (which he calls ⁶ uncta,' because
of the greasy viands cooked there), see S.
ii. 4. 62 n.

23. Anyulus iste seret] Horace writes
as if he wcre repeating the contemptuous
language of the villicus. ‘ That little nook
of yours will produce pepper and frankin-
cense (which of course was impossible)
sooner than grapes.' The grapes grown

on the farm he did not think worthy of —

the name. That Horace made his own
wine, and that it was not too bad to put
before Maecenas, we know from C. i. 20.
‘ Thus ’ or ‘ tus ' (see Forcell.) ‘ olibannm‚’
which is a gum resin, extracted from a
tree called the Boswellia Thurifera„ and
is now brought from India. virgil (Georg.
i. 57) ε “ India mittit ebur, molles sua tura
Sabaei.” [‘ Piper :' S. ii. 4. '73 n.]

25. meretrici· tibicina] As to ‘tibiae sec
C. iii. 19. 19; ἰν. 15. 30. It was played
by women as well as men.

26. et tamen urges] This 16 said witha
sort of mock compassion: ‘and yet, poor
man ! (though you have none of these com-
forts to help you on your way) you have to
go on turning up the rough 6011, feeding
the oxen, looking out for floods, and all
that! ‘J ampridem non tacta’ implies that
Horace's property had been neglected be-
fore it came into his sion. One of
the duties of the ‘ villicus ’ was to look aster
the banks of the Digentia, which over-
flowed when the rains came down beavily.
