HORATII FLACCI

An vigilare metu exanimem, noctesque diesque

Formidare malos fures, incendia, servos

Ne te compilent fugientes, hoc juvat? Horum
Semper ego optarim pauperrimus esse bonorum.

“ At si condoluit tentatum frigore corpus, 80
Aut alius casus lecto te adfixit, habes qui

Adsideat, fomenta paret, medicum roget ut te

Suscitet ac gnatis reddat carisque propinquis?

Non uxor salvum te vult, non filius 3 omnes ⁶

Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae. 85
Miraris, quum tu argento post omnia ponas,

Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem?

An si cognatos, nullo natura labore

Quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amieos,

Infelix operam perdas, ut si quis asellum 90
In Campo doceat parentem currere frenis?

[78. eom pilent] See v. 121. ‘Compi-

lare' means ‘to rob? Asconius, commonly
called Pseudo· Asconius, explains the word
thus, p. 167 (Cic.Ver1·. ii. 1. 13): ‘Pilos per-
vellerit, sic fraudaverit furto ut ne pilos
quidem in corpore spoliatis reliquerit.']

79. pauperrimus—bonorum] C. iii. 30.
11, “ Pauper aquae Daunus.’' S. ii. 3. 142,
“Pauper Opimius argenti positi intus et
auri.’' ‘Tentatum' in the next line is a
word used in connexion with diseases.

80. At si condoluit] This may be an
argument urged by the avaricious man.

‘if you have money ypu will have anxious

friends to nurse you in sickness.' Orelli
puts a (P) after‘ propinquis, 'and supposes
the meaning to be‚‘ 1f you are sick will any
one nurse you and pray for your recovery P
Not one.’ But ‘ at’ seems to be the 'm-
troduction ofa reply, which use it so often
serves. [Ritter also says that 80—83 are
10 be assigned to the poet ; and then the
sense may be, ‘Well, you will say‚’ &c.;
and the answer will be ‘Non uxor,' &c.

But Ritter also puts a (Ρ) after ‘propin-

uis?
q 81.] lecto te adfixit] The old editions
nearly all have 11110 reading. Most MSS„
and among them those of the Berne, have
‘ afflixit,’ which Lambinus and Cruquius
adopt, and the former declares the correct-
ness of that reading is not to be doubted.
He adopts the same in S. ii. 2. 79. Ηο
takes it to have the same meaning 11010 as
there, ‘ illidere! But it is not suitable in
either place. Bentley has aptly quoted

Seneca (Ep. 67). “Ago gratia-s senectuti
quod me lectulo affixit 3'’ and Cicero (in
Verr. Act. 11. 5. 7)· . “ Pater grandis natu
jam diu lecto tenebatur.”

85. pueri alque puellae] This proverbial
sort of expression occurs S. ii. 3. 130.

[86. aryento post] There seems no ex-
planation of this except that ‘argento ’
depends on the preposition ‘ post? Ritter
quotes a similar use of ‘ante’ from Cicero
(De Off. iii. 13) ε ‘ malitia—mala bonis
ponit ante.’]

88. An si eoynatos] ‘But say, if you
would retain and keep 1110 affection of those
relations whom nature gives you without
any trouble of your own, would you lose
your labour, like the luckless fool that tries
to turn an ass into a racer P' ‘Nullo labore'
cannot go with ‘retinere‚’ as Dacier and
others take it. The position of the words
forbids it, and ‘ operam perdas ’ would have
no meaning. ‘ Sine labore tuo’ is Por-
phyrion's explanation, and ‘ gratuitos’ is
Acron's, though he 11011000 1110 011101. ‘ At
si’ is the reading of the Scholiasta, of the
old editions, and most MSS. ‘Ac si' isin
others, and Heindorf adopts it. Variousv
other readings have been proposed, but ‘at ’
or ‘ an ’are the best. Orelli (2nd ed.) adopts
‘ an ' on the authority of his two oldest
MSS. With either the sentence should be
pointed interrogatively. [Ore11i‚ 3rd ed.
‘At si . . . frenis.’] Training an ass 10 run
in the Campus among the horses (C. i. 8. 5 ;
iii. 12. 7) was perhaps a. proverbial way of
expressiug lost labour.
