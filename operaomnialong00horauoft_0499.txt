4. Atip m Saturnalibus] The old edi-
timis, and all till Bentley, together with
nutet of the MSS„ have ‘3ab’ but the
eldat of the Blandinians had ‘at‚' which
Bentley restored to the text. Horace’s
nse of‘ yat' in replies is so common that Ι
think Bentley is right. ‘But, say you,

‘WelL then? Damasippus proceeds‘ since

celebrated on the nineteenth of December;
but aster C.Caesar reformed the Calendar,
they began on the 17 th of December, and
,continued the two following days. Ma-
crobius, Sat. i. 10.] They represented the
liberty of the golden age of Saturn (S. ii.

7. 4: “libertate Decembri '’)‚ and one of
the chief features was the licence gmntetol
to slaves. They had all the mockery

steedom for a few hours, which they spent
like their betters in rioting. The feast
belonged more to the country than the
town, and was properly a farmer’s festival.
But it was attended with greater disturb-

be quiet at that time would be glad to re-
tire to the country. Bentley thinks he
disposes of‘ ab’ by asking ‚how a man
could run away from the Saturnalia: were
they not celebrated in the country as well
as in the town Ρ The same question would
apply to the other reading just as well; for
if a man went into the country during the
Saturnalia, it would be to retire from the
tumult of it· , and that is the answer,
whichever reading is adopted. Bentley
joins ‘sobrius’ with ‘fugistif which takes
away all its force.

precisely the same as the ‘kulum’ now

pyrus, it was chiefly brought from Egypt,
and when cut and ready for use, differed
scarcely at all from the pens we employ.
