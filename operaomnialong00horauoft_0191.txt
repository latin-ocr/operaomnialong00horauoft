21. Der-epta vidi] Lambinus first cor·
rected ‘direpta’ against all the MSS. he
was acquainted with ς for which Cruquius
quarrels with him, and thinks ‘direpta’
will do very well. The remark made on
‘dimoveo' in the note on C. i. 1. 13 (see
also note on c.1. 17 of this book) applica
equallyto‘ diripio! The differenceisclearly
marked in Tacitus (Αιιιι. i. 20). “Direp-
tisque proximis vicis ipsoque Nauporto
quod municipii instar erat, retinentes cen-
turionoe irrisu et contumeliis postremo
verberibus insectantur, praecipua in Aufi-
dienum praefectum castrorum ira, quem
dereptum vehiculo sarcinis gravant. ” Again
(c. 23)‚‘ ‘Tribunos tamen ac praesectum
castrorum extrusere; sarcinae fugientium
direp taee’ ‘Deripere’ is to pull down or
off, ‘diripere' (C. i. 9. 23) is to pull in
piecae. The MSS„ which are perhaps unani-
mous in favour of ‘direpta’ here, favour

‘deripere' in other places (see Index).

[Ritter has ‘direpta.’]

A. P.1992 “Et apertis otia portis.” ‘Marte'
belongs to populata? See C. i. 6. 2 n.
