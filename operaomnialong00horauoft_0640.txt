604 HORATII FLACCI

QUID tibi visa Chios, Bullati, notaque· Lesbos,
Quid concinna Samos, quid Croesi regia Sardes,

Smyrna quid et Colophon ’.Ρ

Maj ora minorave fama,

Cunctane prae Campo et Tiberino flumine sordent ⁶?

1. Quid tibi visa Chios] The island
of Chios was rugged and mountainous.
(“Chio’s rocky isle ”) 3 but had, as it
still has, an excellent climate and choice
wines: the women also were very hand-
some ; in all of which ancient and modern
accounts agree. The principal town, Chios,
was a noble city, richly adorned with
buildings and works of art. Verres plun-
dered it of some of the best statues (Cic.
in Verr. ii. 1. 19). Not a trace of any
thing remains. Horace calls Lesbos cele-
brated, and its fame need not be supp posed
to depend οιι the wines, or on Alcaeus and
Sappho, as the commentators say. From
the Trojan War to the times of the Roman
Empire, when Tacitus calls it “insula
nobilis et amoena ’' (Ann. vi. 3), the for-
tunes of Lesbos, its revolutions and con·
quests, its connexion with Athens, its
tradition of Orpheus, its poets and mu-
sicians and statesmen, its cities and works
of art, its fields and vineyards and climate,
all contributed to make it the most con—
spicuous island in the Aegean.

Samos (the island) is rough, but the
town is meant, and it is called ‘ coneinna'
from the buildings, of which a temple of
J uno was one of the most conspicuous.
Cicero calls it “fanum antiquissimum et
nobilissimum '' (Verr. ii. 1. 19). Outside
and inside this temple was adorned with
the finest works of art. There was also a
celebrated mole at Samos made to pro-
tect the harbour.

The town of Sardes (αἱ Σάρδεις), or the
greater part of it, from the facility with
which it was burnt to the ground in the
revolt of the Ionians, B.c. 499, must ori·
ginally have been built of slight materiale,
though it was the seat of enormous wealth
during the reigns of the Lydian kings, and
especially that of Croesus, whose palaee
became the residence of the Persian Sa-
traps and was beautified by them, espe-
cially by Cyrus the younger, whose gardens
were celebrated (Cic. de Senect. c. 17).
The strength of its natural position was
extraordinary. The river Pactolus flowed
through the city. There are traces of a
theatre and marble piers supporting masses
of brick, but all these remains no doubt
are Roman. Sardes surrendered to Alex-
ander, and after his death passed through
the hands of Antigonus, Seleucus, and his

descendants, and the kings of Pergamum,
till Lydia became part of· the Roman pro-
vince of Asia. Some of the imperial coins
of Sardes bear the inscription, ΣΑΡΔΕΙΣ.
ΑΣΙΑΣ. ΛῪΔῙΑΣ. ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟΛΙΣ. [Ritter
has‘ Croesi regia Sardis’ from Priscian.

3. Smyrna quid et Colophon] Alexan er
the Great found Smyrna ιιι ruins, and con-
ceived the design of re· -building it, being
prompted by Nemesis ιιι a dream. He did
not live to do so, but Antigonus began
and Lysimachus finished a new town on a
magnificent scale„ Strabo (p. 646) gives
a description of it, and speaks of it as one
of the most beautiful cities of Ionia. There
are coins of the empire bearing the in-
scription ΣΜΎῬΝΑῙΩΝ ΠΡΩΤΟΝ ΑΣΙΑΣ
ΚΑΛΛΕΙ ΚΑΙ ΜΕΓΕΘΕῙ. Among other

objects of interest was a. temple erected tor

Homer, and called Homerium. The in-
habitants claimed him as their country·
man, and showed a cave in which it was
said he wrote his poems. The ruins that
now stand are not many, the Turks having
used the materials for building; but ex-
cavations have brought to light many
statues, inscriptions, and medals.

Colophon, also in Ionia on the Hales,
was destroyed by Lysimachus with Lebe-
dus (v. 6). The chief atti-action was its
neighbourhood to the shrine of the Clarian
A Dllo.

ΡΞ Majora minorave sama] ‘Be they
greater or less than report makes them out
to be (I care not which), are they not all
tame compared with the Campus Martius
and the Tiber ?' ‘Ve’ is probably formed
from ‘vel,’ and had much the same mean-
ing, being chiefly used in poetry. When

‘’vel is used, an indifference in the
speaker’ s mind is im plied as to which of
the two cases or objects be taken. ‘’Ne
being attached to ‘ cuncta’ shows that the
emphasis lies on that word (Key's L. G.
1444 n.‚ and 1417). Ven. 1483, Ascens.
1529, and most of the old editions,
and the great majority of MSS„ have
‘minorave' Lambinus and many editors
after him, including Bentley, have followed
the Aldine editions, which have ‘minorane '
But ‘ne' has little MS. authority. If
‘minorane’ be the true reading, ‘fama’
must be followed by a note of interro-
gation. [Ritter has ‘majora minorave

fama Ρ ']
