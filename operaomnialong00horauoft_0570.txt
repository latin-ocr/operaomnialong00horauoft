HORATII FLACCI

Quae parvo sumi nequeunt obsonia captas?

‘opimis,' and to take ‘responsat ' in the
same sense as above (v. 85). Ι prefer
taking it in the sense of ‘ corresponds to,'
as ‘ responsura ³ in S. 8. 66. What Davus
says I think amounts to this: ‘ I am good
for nothing, because I am attracted by a
cake just hot from the oven 3 you forsooth
are virtuous and noble because you feast
upon good things? So the same opposition
appears in these lines as in the two before.
‘ Libum' was a coarse sort of cake made of
pounded obesse, eggS, and flour, all mixed
. together and baked (Cato, R. R. 75, For-
cell.). There was another sort used in
sacrifice (Epp. i. 10. 10 11.). Τ118 ‘liba’
Davus means were such as the good old
woman at Bovillae made for the poor. See
Ovid, Fast. iii. 667 sqq. :—

“ Orta suburbanis quaedam fuit Anna
Paulpgglziiell’mundae sedulilatis anus.

Illa levi mitra canos redimita capillos ’
Fingebat tremula rustica liba manu.

Atque ita per populum fumantia mane
Dividiffezb haec populo copia grata fuit.

[105. plector enim] ‘ 1 suffer in my back,
that's the reason? Davus has a whipping.
‘ Enim’ is sometimes translated ‘for,' but
this translation will only suit some sen-
tences. Caesar, B. G. v. '7 : ‘ Ille enim re-
vocatus resistere . . . coepit :³ ‘ he began
to resist‚ as might be expected; as a matter
of course.’ See Cicero, Verr. ii. 1. 9.]

— Qui tu impunitior] Persius has
copied this way of speaking. See above v.
7 9 n.

[108. Illusiquepedes] ‘Literally‚ ‘your
feet mocked are unable to bearyour diseased
body.' The man has the gout in his feet.
I do not suppose with Doederlein that
‘ illusi ’ has any reference to the incapacity
of the feet to bear the paunch, and the de-
rision of the spectators being excited by
such a sight. The feet are mocked or im—
paired in their office by the cxcesscs of the

υ fugit?

110. Furtiva mutat strigili]
construction with ‘muto ’ see C. i. 1¹7. 2.
The ‘ strigil‚’ which the Greeks called
στλεγγίς, was a seraper of bone or metal,
of a curved form and with a sharp edge,
with which the skin was scraped after
bathing, οι· exercise in the gymnasium. See
Becker's Gallus, ‘Exc. on the Baths? and
Dict. Ant. on the same subject, for an ac-
count of these instrumente. [‘ Sub noc-
tem :' see Epod. ii. 44.]

112. Non horam tecum essepotes] Acron
interprete this “non es tecum: i.e. non 88
sanus,’' which does not appearto be the mean-
ing. To a man who has no resources in him·
self, or is afraid of his own conscience or his
own thoughts, and resorts to am usements or
other means ofdistractiou todivert his mind,
these words apply. ‘Tecum habita,’ ‘inha-
bit your own breast, make that your home’
(Pers. S. iv. 52). Seneca (de Tranq. An.
ii. 2) says. “aliud ex alio iter suscipitur
et spectacula spectaculis mutantur, ut ait
Lucretius: ‘hoc se quisque modo semper
Sed quid prodest si non effugit Ρ
Sequitur se ipse et urget gravissimus
comes.'' The quotation from Lucretius is
taken from the third book, v, 1068. The
whole passage will illustrate this of Horace.
It is quoted on C. ii. 16. 19, which and
other places of Horace there mentioned,
may be compared with this. The difference
between ‘fugitivus' and ‘ erro ² is explained
by Ulpian (Dig. 21. 1. 17, § 14): “ Erronem
ita definit Labeo, pusillum fugitivum esse,
et ex diverso fugitivum magnum erronem
esse 3 sed proprie erronem sic definimus
quinon quidem fugit sed frequenter 81118
causa vagatur, et temporibus 111 res nugato-
rias consumptis serius domum redit.'' That
is, a ‘fugitivus’ 18 a slave who runs away
outright3 an‘ erro’ was an idle fellow who
skulked out of the way to escape work or
to amuse himself. There was the same dis·
tinction in the army between ‘desertor’-
and ⁶ emansor? A ‘ fugitivus’ was branded

See ‘illudere' S. ii. 8. 62.]
