poem in the form of an ‹Arg-ument. This serves the purpose* of ’
giving a conspective view of the poem and its scope,-and the con-
nexion of the different parts, and often supplies a word or sentence
which it otherwise might be necessary to translate in a note. The

Arguments and Introductions will be found to relieve the notes
considerably.

I have done my best to determine the merits of the various
readings, and to choose in every disputed case the best, according
to my judgment. I have given in a note the amount of authority
for each disputed reading that Ι have adopted, and there is not a-
word in the text which has not good MS. authority. “ Lectiones
ex conjectura profectas tanquam pestem a contextu procul me
removisse dico¹.” To those who >are accustomed to look upon
Bentley as a benefactor to the text of Horaee, this statement will
not be acceptable. I have in no single instance adopted a con-
jecture of Bentley’s or any body else’s ², nor have I proposed any
myself. The antiquity, genuineness, and number of the MSS. of
Horace that have been colla-ted by scholars of great respectability‚
as well as the authority of the Scholiasts and quotations in early
writers, all combine to supply materials for a more perfect text of
Horace than we can get of almost any other writer. Opinions will
always differ as to the choice of readings, but to desert the MSS.
and resort to conjecture in the ease of this author Ι hold to be
inexcusable. I have not seen the smallest excuse for it in any
single instance, and with this opinion Ι can only look upon the
numerous conjectural readings of Bentley (nearly all of which I
have referred to in the notes) as so many instances of false taste
and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “ conjecturae summi Critici, etsi semper sagaces
et acutae, admodum raro a circumspecto Critico probari nune

² [The editor has made a mistake here. There are several passages in which he hae
accepted conjectura] readings ς and he has in some cases informed the reader that
they are conjectural. Ι believe however that the editor has not admitoed any of

Bentley's conjectures, and those which he has accepted from others are few and not
like Bentley's.]
