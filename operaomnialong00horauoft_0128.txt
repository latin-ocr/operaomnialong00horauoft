HORATII FLACCI

Soon thou must give up all to thiue·heir;

rich and noble, or poor and humble‚ we must all come to one place in the eud.

AEQUAM memento rebus in arduis
Servare mentem, non secus in bonis
Ab insolenti temperatam
Laetitia, moriture Delli,
Seu maestus omni tempore vixeris, 5
Seu te in remoto gramine per dies
Festos reclinatum bearis
Interiore nota Falerni.
Quo pinus ingens albaque populus

Umbram hospitalem consociare amant

Ramis? Quid obliquo laborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo ⁴?
Huc vina et unguenta et nimium breves

Flores amoenae ferre jube rosae,

Dum res et aetas et sororum

Fila trium patiuntur atra.
Cedes coemptis saltibus et domo
Villaque flavus quam Tiberis lavit,

Cedes et exstructis in altum

Divitiis potietur heres.

2. non secus in] A few MSS. have ‘non
secus ac‚’ which Bentley prefers :but ‘non
secus' may stand alone. [‘ Insolenti’ is
immoderate]

[5. omni tempore] A common prosaic
expression. Caesar, B. G. i. 43. Lucre-
tius, i. 26, ‘tempore in omni.’]

8. Interior-e nota Falerni] The cork of
the ‘ amphora ' was stamped with the name
of the consul in whose year it was filled,
and the ‘amphorae’ being placed in the
‘ apotheca' as they were filled, the oldest
would be the innermost. Cicero (Brut.
83), mentioning the speeches in Thucy-
didos, likens them to very old Falerniau,
and says the style had better be avoided,
“ tanquam Anicianam notam‚' like wine of
the consulship of Anicius.

9. Quo pinus ingens] The oldest aud
best MSS. have ‘ qu0,’ which signifies ‘to
what purpose‚’ as “quo mihi fortunam si
non conceditur uti? '³ (Epp. i. 5. 12). ‘Qua'
is Bentley's reading from two MSS.of Lam-
binus, who was the first to adopt it. In
v. 11 the MSS. vary between ⁶ qu0,' ‘qua‚'
and ‘quid' Laudinus has the'lirst; As·
censius and Lambinus the second3 Cru-

quius has ‘quidi'’ Without the interro·
gatory mark, ‘quid' is I think the true
reading. Itis that of the oldest Berne and
Blandinian MS. Stephens (1600) has ‘et,'
and Bentley and most of the later editors,
but no MSS. The Scholiast Porphyrion
had ‘ quo obliquo,' and his comment is
“ subaudiendum, si ea non utimum et est
totum adverbialiter dictum,'’ which shows
how he understood the passage. But such
an hiatus is quite inadmissible. ‘Qua' and
‘ et ' are very simple emendatione, and give
a good meaning. But I cannot account for
the other readings if Horace wrote ‘ qua—
et.’ He seems to mean, “ What were the
shade and the cool stream given' for?
Bring out the wine and let us drink ;''
which is abrupt and more spirited than the
other. [Ritter and Keller read ‘ Quo . . .
ramis, quo et' without a? aster ‘riVQ' and
make ‘Huc vina? &c. the correlative of
‘ Quo pinus ’ &c.]

albaque populus] Not ‘ ultaque,’ as
the oldest editions have it, corrected by
Lambinus. This mistake arose from Epod.
imo, “Altus maritat populos.’' The Greeks
had two names for the poplar—Aevtc-h, which
