CARMlNUM III. 6.

Paene occupatam seditionibus
Delevit Urbem Dacus et Aethiops,
Hic classe formidatus, ille 15
Missilibus melior sagittis.
Fecunda culpae secula nuptias
Primum inquinavere et genus et domos;
Hoc fonte derivata clades
In patriam populumque fluxit. 20
Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
Matura virgo et fingitur artibus ;
J am nunc et inoestos amores
De tenero meditatur ungui:
