EPISTOLARUM II. 2. 679

Sedulitas autem stulte quem diligit urget, 260
Praecipue cum se numeris commendat et arte:

Discit enim citius meminitque libentius illud

Quod quis deridet quam quod probat et veneratur.

Nil moror officium quod me gravat, ac neque ficto

In pejus vultu proponi cereus usquam, 265
Nec prave 188118 decorari versibus opto,

Ne rubeam pingui donatus munere, et una

Et piper et quidquid chartis amicitur ineptis. 270

EPISTLE H.

This Epistle 18 addressed vo Julius Florus, tn whom also the third of the first book
was written. (See Introduction.) The professed purpose is to excuse Horace for not
having sent Florus any versoe. He says he had wax-ned him before he went that 118
should not be able to write ; that he had grown lazy. He reminds him too that he
had origInally only written verses to bring himself into notice because he was poor, and
now he had not the same motive. Besides he was getting on in yearS, and people’s
tastes were so various, 88(1 1118 110188 88(1 engagements of the town so distmcting‚ and
the trouble of giving and receiving compliments so great, that he had abandoned

himself a lecture of nearly a hundred lines, the substance of which is that he had better
