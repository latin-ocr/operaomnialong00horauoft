HORATII FLACCI

Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,
Ne currente retro funis eat rota.
Non te Penelopen difficilem procis

binus to have existed in some of his MSS.
Bentley says it arose out of another various
reading ‘ limine' (Canter, N ov. Lect. iv. 2),
from which he draws fresh support for his
reading ‘duro,' quoting Ovid (Rem. Am.
508), “Nec latus in duro limine pone
'tuum.’' He might have added (Epod. xi.
22), “Limina dura quibus lumbos et infregi
latus.’' Aristotle (Probl. xxv. 18) answers
the question, why it is colder in clear wea-
ther than in cloudy‚ in a way of his own:
διὰ τί τῆς αἰθρίας, κ.τ.λ. [‘Glaciet' per-
haps first used by Horace. Statius has
it.]

10. Ne currente retro funis eat rota]
‘Lest the wheel turn back and the rope
with it,’ is Orelli's interpretation, applying
‘retro' to both ‘currente’ and ‘eat.' The
iuctaphor in that caseis taken from a rope
wound round a cylinder, and when the
cylinder is allowed to run back, the rope
runs down and the weight or thing at-
tached goes with it. The application of the
proverb to a coquette who continues her
pride till she loses her power is obvious.
The passage has caused a good deal of dif-
ficulty, and no two interpreters are entirely
agreed as to the meaning of the words.
Orelli's interpretation is the best that Ι
have seen. Turnebus takes ‘funis' for
‘ funalis equus‚' and ‘ rota' for the chariot-
wheel; and he understands the words to
mean, ‘lest the rope-horse should start
back while the eoach is going on, and so

you be thrown out and kined.’ He quotes
Ausonius (Epitaph. Her. xxxv.):

“Pegstgu’? hic dexter currat tibi; laevus
non

Funis ; et ad quartum det tibi Castor -

equum.'’

But the proper reading there seems to be
‘funalis 3 quartum ς’ and ‘funis’ will hardly
bear this meaning. The ‘ funalis equus'
was one of those which were not under the

yoke, but attached by traces, either as lead-

ers or by the side of the yoke-horses.

15. Pieria pellice] A Macedonian strum-
pet, just as Chloe in the last ode was a
Thracian, and on the same principle.
Neai-ly all Horace’s women of this charac-
ter are represented as Greeks. ⁶ Curvat’
is nowhere else used in this sense. [Keller
and Ritter write ‘poelice' 011 the autho-
rity of the oldest Berne MS. and others
of the best MSS. ‘Pellex,’ says Ritter,
owes its existence to a false etymology.
But if ‘paelex’ is the true form, it is an
otherwise unknown Latin word (paelic).
‘ Pellic‚' the crude form of ‘pellex,’ has a
clear etymol . There is nothing like
‘paelic' except the Greek raam-a, and
the corresponding Latin word.]

19. aquae Caelestis] (Epp. ii. 1. 135)
“ Caelestes implorat aquas.'’ There is some
intentional bathos in this threat of the

despairing lover to the mistress he had just ⁴

addressed as a goddess.
