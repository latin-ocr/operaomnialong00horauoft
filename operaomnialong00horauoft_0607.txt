curantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est ⁶? 5
Νοιι tu corpus eras sine pectore. Di tibi formam,

Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.

Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno,

Qui sapere et Q possit quae sentiat, et cui

Gratia, fama, valetudo contingat abunde,

10

Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena?
Inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras,
Omnem crede diem tjbi diluxisse supremum:
Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora.

Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises,

Cum ridere voles Epicuri de grege porcum.

‘ Sine pectorc’ is usedtwice by Ovid (Met.

xiii. 290), “rudis et sine pectore miles?

Heroid. xvi. 305 ε

‘⁴ Hunccine tu speres hominem sine pectore
Pffimssffiffl formae, Tyndari, nosse

e

It means ‘intellect,’ of which the ancients

held thelim-tto be the seat. See Quintilian -

(x. 7.15)= “Pectus oet quod disertos facit
ct vis mentis? Thereq is a difficulty in
‘’el-as which the commentatore have dif-
ferent ways of explaining. Bothe eays
it ia used by enallage for ‘ es‚' like ἣν for
ἑστί, which Obbarius says truly is a piece
of grammarians' nonsense which no one
now believes5 but he does not help us
much by saying that it refers to the time
which was present to the poet’s mind,
since he does not tell us what that time
-wam Orelli says it means ‘Lyou always
were since 1 first knew you‚’ ’which is a
new sense for the imperfect. Others take
it for “ you were before you went into
the country;'' that is, “when I last saw
you,’ 'which implies a doubt whether he
was so at the time of writing. Others
(Gesner and Doering) suppose it to mean
‘you were born so;’ this would be like
the Greek ἔφυς. Terence usae ‘tune eras?
for ‘is it you ?' 1 cannot say 1 am able to
explain the idiom. The imperfect is used
irregularlyin C. i. 27. 19, and 37. 4.

’1. dederunt] Some MSS. and nearly all
the old editions have ‘.'dederant Most
MSS. have the perfect, the penult os which

8. nutricula] Persius makes a nurse

exonam (ιι. 37),

“Hunc optent generum rex et regina 5
Ηὲἓὲῃιὲιῖἳίξιιῐς quicquid calcaverIt hic
rosa .

And in Juvenal (x. 289) the anxious
mother

“ Formam optat modico pneris, majore
Mlppgltlxilse’ quum sanum Veneris videtss’

[9. Qui rapere—possit] There is a
reading‘ quain sapere, ’and some editions
have‘ quam sapere et fari ut possit? but
itis said that there is no MS. authority
for ‘ut.' The text means ‘what more
could a loving nurse wish for her child, if
he should possess wisdom (philosophy) and
be able to say what he thinks, and if he
has abundance‚' &c- Bentley says the
connexion of the worda is plain enough,
and the difficulty of some of the critioe
has been caused by taking the prayer of
the nurse as made for an infant child.
But that is what Horace, I think, intended
to say when he wrote v. 8, which is hardly
consistent wit-h what follows.]

11. muudus] This is explained by S. ii.
2. 65: “Mundus erit qua non offendat
sordibus. '' Many MSS. have ‘et modus
et vietus? out of which Bentley has got
by conjecture ‘et domus et vietus?

13. diluxisse] Forcellini notices the
archaic reading ‘tibid illuxisse: which
is only a conjecture of Muretus.

15. Me pinguem et nitidum] This cor-
responds to Suetonius’ description of Ho-
race's person, ‘⁴ Habitu corporis brevis fuit
atque obesus.’' On ‘ bene curata cute' see
S. ii. 5. 38. Horace was now sleek and

growing fat.
