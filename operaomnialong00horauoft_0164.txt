Africa 3 neque Attali

HORATII FLACCI

Ignotus heres regiam occupavi 3

Nec Laconicas mihi

Trahunt honestae purpuras clientae :

At fides et ingeni

Benigna vena est, pauperemque dives

Me petit; nihil supra

10

Deos lacesso, nec potentem amicum

Largiora flagi to,

Satis beatus unicis Sabinis

Truditur dies die,

15

Novaeque pergunt interire lunae.

Tu secanda marmora

Locas sub ipsum funus, et sepulcri

Immemor struis domos

Marisque Baiis obstrepentis urges

“ De marmore omni quod Carystos invenit,
Quod sshrygia Synnas, Afra quod Nomas
Ettzldffi'virenti fonte lavit Eurotas.”

Tibullus mentions three sorts, and has

Horace's word ‘trabes’ in the following

lines (iii. 3. 13) :—

“ Quidve domus prodest Phrygiis innixa

columnis,
Taenare, sive tuis, sive Caryste tuis?
Et nemora in domibus sacros imitantia
Atii-laissisespi’e trabes marmoreumque
so um

Propertius has a passage very like this of
Horace(iii.2.11 sqq.:) —

“Quod (i. e. quamvis) non Taenariis domus
est mihi fulta columnis
Nec camera auratas inter eburna

trabes, —

At musae comites et carmina cara le,
genti,” &c.
5. Attali] SeeC. i. 1.12n. The mean-

ing is, “I have not had the luck to come
to an unexpected estate, as the Romans
came in for the property of King Attalus

the Third?
8. honestae—elimatae] The form ‘cli-

entes’ is found in the old editions, and
‘cliens ' is of common gender. But Chari-
sius the Grammarian says that ‘clientae '
is the proper form here. The same occurs
in Plautus (Mil. Glor. iii. 1. 192),‘ ‘Habeo
eccillam menn clientam meretricem ado-
lescentulams ³(Rudensiv. 1, 2),‘ ‘jam cli-

ent-as repperi atque ambas forma scitula
atque aetatula? It is not easy for us to
enter into the state of society, which is re-

presented by the words ‘honestae—elien-

tae‚' supposing them to mean, as they seem
to do, women of birth receiving the
bounty of rich patroni, and rendering them
service in return. But 1 do not feel sure
that this is what Horace means, and I have
seen no satisfactory explanation of the
words ‘honestae clientae? Mr. Long has
suggested to me that they may refer tothe ’
rustic women on a man's farma, the wives
of the coloni. The formal and legal con

nexiou of client and patron had undergone
great changes, and the nse of the terms had
become extended before Horace wrote ς at
which time, and still more asterwards,
bodies of voluntary retainers were encour
raged by men of wealth, who liked the dis-
play and the consequence such attendancc
gave them, and purchased it at a eostly
rate. The daily dole, which went by the
name of‘ sportula, ' was not established till
some years after Horace wrote3 but the
system which led to it existed· ιιι his day,

though not to the same extent that it

afterwards reached.
10. Beniytza vena] This metaphor is

from a mine ; but Ovid (Trist. iii. 14. 33)
takes the same word fora running stream:—

“Ingenium fregere meum mala, cujus et
ante
Fons infecundus parvaque vena fuitss’

16. interire] This word seems to be an
