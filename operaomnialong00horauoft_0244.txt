HORATII FLACCI

Unde quo veni? Levis una mors est

Virginum culpae.

Vigilansne ploro

Turpe commissum, an vitiis carentem

Ludit imago

Vana quae porta fugiens eburna
Somnium dueit ⁶? Meliusne fluetus
Ire per longos fuit an recentes

Carpere flores?

Si quis infamem mihi nunc juvencum

⁴5

Dedat iratae lacerare ferro et
Frangere enitar modo multum amati

Cornua monstri.

Impudens liqui patrios Penates,

Impudens Orcum moror.

O deorum 50

Si quis haee audis, utinam inter errem

Nuda leones !

Antequam turpis macies decentes
Occupet malas teneraeque sucus

Defluat praedae, speciosa quaero

Pascere tigres,

plains it] ς but ‘filiae nomen' come too
close together for this interpretation. The
Seholiasts separate ‘ victa’ from ‘pietas,'
as if it were ‘dixit victa furore? but see
Introd. ‘ Unde' implies, not that she was
so distracted that she had forgotten from
whence she had come, but ‘ What an ex-
change have Ι made Ξ So dear a home for
this strange place !’ It is all very natural
and beautiful. ‘ Una mors ’ is perhaps an
imitation of Sophocles' (Antig. 308) οὐχ
ῧμιν”Αιδης μοῦνος ἀρκέσει. Propertius re-
peats the words (iv. 4. 17) : “ Et satis una
malae potuit mors esse puellae.'’ For
‘ virginum' Markland, for ‘vitiis’ Bent-
ley proposes the singular number.

41. porta fugiens eburna] This is the
image of Homer (Odyss. xix. 562) :—

δοιαὶ ’γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνεί-

αἱ ῗιῖἶ ’γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δ’ ἐλέ-

&faga μέν κ’ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέ-
φαντος,

οἵ ῥ’ ἐλεφαίρονται ἔπε’ ἀκράαντα φέροντες·

οἳ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε,

&lg ἔτυμα κραίνουσι βροτῶν· ὅτι κέν τις
ι ηται.

virgil’s imitation is Aen. vi. 894 sqq. ε
“ Sunt geminae Somni portae,'’ &c-

48. Cornua monstri] ‘ Tauri’ is the
reading of nearly all the earliest editions.
But Bentley adopts ‘monstri‚’ which is
{iissss‘iazi‘} ¹13³gffl¹et¹333¹1123233¹³38b255⁸3÷2¹132
best repnte. [Keller and Ritter have
‘ monstri.'] The zurich has ‘ tauri!

49. Impudens liqui] ‘1 had no shame
when I left my father's house. 1 have no
shame or I should not hesitate to die:
either because she deserved to die, or be-
cause her chastity was in danger. ‘ Orcum
moror ' is equivalent to ‘ dubito mori,’ like
ovid (Heroid. ix. 146): “Impia quid du-
bitas Deianira mori :'' but it isan unusual
form. Seeing nothing but death before
her, she prays to be killed at once rather
than die a lingering death by hunger, and

that this stanza has been abused, and its
omission proposed, because it is said to be
unnatural, which appears to me very much
opposed to the fact. The language is na·
tural, whether viewed with reference to
the horrors of a. linger-ing death, or to the
pride of a young girl in her good looks.
It is probably imitated from the Greek.
