behalf of Scaurus: “Libertus patronum .

non occidit, sed duobus digitulis gulam

other animals, resorted to the means most
natural to him, which were not cold steel,

poison. ‘ Mirum, ut neque,' &c., ‘Strange!
yes, as strange as that the wolf does not

58. seu Mors atris circumvolat alis]
The rep resentations of Death m the works
of art tphat have come down to us are very
few From medals, coins, 86618, rings,
dcc„ the figure of Death would be banished,
as Spence says (Poly metis, p. 260), because
it would be unsuitable and of ill omen;
pictures we have few re·
maining. In those probably the represen-
tations of the poets were copied, or those
which we find in the poets are copied from
them, and this of death with dark wings
hovering over a man looks very like the
representation of 6 painting. Seneca de-
scribes Death with many wings:

“ Mors alta avidos oris hiatus
Pandit et omnes explieat alasss’
(Oedipus, Act i. Chor.)
