CARMEN X.

This ode is said by the Scholiast Porphyrion to be taken from Alcaeus, and according
to him is a mere translation, for he commences his commentary by calling it “Hym-
nus in Mercurium ab Alcaeo lyrico poeta.'' He says the story of Apollo’s cows was
invented by Alcaeus, aud his assertion is confirmed by Pausanias (vii. 20. 2): βουσὶ
’γὰρ χαίρειν μάλιστα Ἀπόλλωνα Ἀλκαῖός τε ἐδήλωσεν ἐν ὕμνῳ τῷ εἷς Ἑρμῆν, ’γράψας
ὥς ὅ Ἑρμῆς βοῦς ὑφέλοιτο τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος. The first line of a Sapphic ode of Alcaeus
has been preserved, which seems to have been that which Horace imitated ε Χαῖρε Κυλ-
λάνας ὁ μέδεις, σὲ γάρ μοι (3 Bergk). The attributes and legends belonging to Hermes,
the Greek divinity, are transferred to Mercurius the Latin, who was originally a different
conception from Hermes. Ovid (Fast. v. 663 sqq.) gives much the same account of
Mercurius in his happy manner. He also mentions the story of the cows. His descrip-
tion begins with the same apostrophe as this, ‘ Clare nepos Atlantis?

ARGUMENT.

Mei-cury. thou who in their infancy didst tame the human race by the gists of speech
and the palaestra, of thee will I sing, thou messenger of the gods, thou master of the
lyre and prince of thieves. Why, while Apollo was threatening thee for stealing his
coine, he turned and laughed to find his quiver was gone. By thee Priam passed
through the Grecian camp (Il. xxiv. 334). Thou conductedst souls to their last home,
thou favourite of gods above and gods below !

MERCURI facunde nepos Atlantis,
Qui feros cultus hominum recentum
Voce formasti catus et decorae
More palaestrae,
Te canam magni J ovis et deorum 5
Nuntium curvaeque lyrae parentem,
Callidum quidquid placuit jocoso
Condere furto.
