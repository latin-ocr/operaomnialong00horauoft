possunt3.” ffNor do Ι think he is much more happy, in most in-
stances (especially in the Odes) ‚ in his choice of readings than in
his conjectures, He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
andpoetical taste, as well as by the excess of a prurient sagacity⁴
and an unbounded egotism. The text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli’s than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, I think, always given in the notes. He collated some
excellent MSS.‚ especially three in the library at Berne, of which
the oldest he placoe at the end of the eighth century or the be-
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another of
Ziirich containing the OdeS, Epodes, and Ars Poetica, both of
which he says are of the tenth century. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatican and other Roman MSS. collated by
Fen (1811); twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
collated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth century 3 and sundry others quoted with or without
name by Lambinus (1577‘), Cruquius (1611 ⁶), Torrentius (1608 ⁵),
and Bentley (1711). Of the last the most important are four
collat-,ed by Cruquius, and known as the Bland'mian MSS. belonging
to the monks of a Benedictine monastery in Flanders, and which
⁴were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by fire.
The oldest of these, which is appealed to as a great authority, but
which was certainly more osten wrong than right in the instances
in which Cruquius quotes it, was said to tbe earlier than the ninth
century. On the margin of this MS. Cruquius found some old
notes, which, as he says, with infinite pains he deciphered, and he
has added them to his own commentary in a separate form. These
scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Comm. Cruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentat-ies of Acron and Por-
phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authori-
ties. The readings of these three Scholiasts help out the MSS.‚
