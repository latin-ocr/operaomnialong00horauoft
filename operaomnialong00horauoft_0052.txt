burial. ‘ Sicci oculi’ are fitting accompani-
ments of a heart so hard as this venturous

discoverer is said to have had, The MSS.
vary between ‘ turgidum’ and ‘ turbidum'

HORATII FLACCI

Qui vidit mare turgidum et
Infames scopulos Acroceraunia?
Nequicquam deus abscidit
Prudens Oceano dissociabili
Terras si tamen impiae

Non tangenda rates transiliunt vada.

Audax omnia perpeti

Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.

Audax Iapeti genus

Ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit.
Post ignem aetheria domo

Subductum macies et nova febrium
Terris incubuit cohors,

Semotique prius tarda necessitas

χωρεῖ περιβρυχίοισιν
περῶν ὑπ’ οἴδμασιν.

in v. 19. Bentley adopts the latter, as
“fortius epitheton quod majorem terro-
rem incutit.'’ ‘Turbidum' may represent
the muddy appearance of the sea after a
storm, the other speaks of its swelling
waves.

20. [Acroceraunia] The Alta Ceraunia
of Virgil, Georg. i. 332, mountains on the
coast of Epirus. Compare Virg. Aen. iii.

221! dissociabili] Used actively, as ‘Pe-
netrabile telum' (Aeneid), “ Genitabilis
aura Favoni '’ (Lucret. i. 11), and in Ho-
race ‘Amabilem' (C. i. 5. 10), ‘ Illacruma-
bilem' (ii. 14. 6), which is used passively
C. iv. 9. 25. Gesner gives a long list of
similar words with an active signification.
Bentley reads ‘ dissociabiles‚’ assuming the
common reading to be a corruption of ‘ dis·
sociabilis’ and that to bc put for his word,
by which he understands ‘ lands not meant
to be united? The active sense he says
has no authority, but it has abundant sup-
port from analogy. Tacitus uses it pas·
sively (Agr. 3), “res olim dissociabiles
miscuerit principatum et libertatem? The
common reading agrees with Lucret. (v.
203), “ Et mare quod late terrarum distinet
oras.” ‘ Prudens' is ‘ providens,' fore-
seeing the evil to come.

25. Audax omnia perpeti] Compare
with this Soph. Antig. 332 sqq. ε

πολλὰ τὰ δεινὰ κούδὲν ἇν-
θρώπου δεινότερον πέλει.
τοῦτο καὶ πολιοῦ πέραν
πόντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ

σχει δὲ ταύτὸ τοῦτο καὶ τὰ κ ρδαμα,
where πάσχει has in a qualified way
the meaning of ποιεῖ, has been quoted to
support the same sense in ‘pei-peti? But
it probably means no more than endurance
to the end. ‘ Vetitum’ with ‘ nefas’ is not
altogether redundant. It expresses crimes
which are obviously forbidden, asshown by
the obstructions thrown in the way of their l ›
commission. X

27. Iapeti =qenus] This is after the use
of γένος, which occurs not rarely in the
Tragoedians. Eurip. Cyclops 104, δριμὺ
Σισύφου γένος, for Ulysses ,· Virg. Aen. iv.
12 : “ genus esse Deorum.''-Prometheus,
the son of Iapetus, also claimed to be the
inventor of ships (Aesch. P. V. 46¹7).

28. fraude mala] ⁶ Mala' merely means
mischievous or fatal thest, referring to its
consequences. The epithet is not here
redundant, perhaps less than in Soph. Oed.
Col. 4026, τὰ ’γὰρ δόλῳ τῷ μὴ δικαίῳ
κτήματ’ οὐχὶ σώζεται. The old commen·
tators refer to the distinction between
‘ dolus malns’ a fraud with bad intent, and
‘dolus bonus’ with good intent. Ulpian
(Dig. 4. 3. 1), referring to the praetor's
words, “ Quae dolo malo facta esse di-
centur . . ..iudicium dabo,'’ says “ non fuit
autem contentus praetor dolum dicere, sed
adjecit malum quoniam veteres dolum
etiam bonum dicebant et pro sollertia hoc
nomen accipiebant, maxime si adversus
hostem latronemve quis machinaretur.”

39. Subductum] ‘ Sub’ in composition
has sometimes that force of ὑπό which sig-
