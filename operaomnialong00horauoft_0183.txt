66. Auctore Phoebo] Bentley would
like to change ‘'auctore into ‘’structore.
but would not object to‘ ductore,’ because
Horace says elsewhere,

“ -— potiore ductos
Alite muros3

and Virgil says (Aen. i. 423),‘ pars ducere
muros? Horace might as properly say
‘auctore Phoebo? as virgil
thius-auctor’ (G.· 1ii. 36).
