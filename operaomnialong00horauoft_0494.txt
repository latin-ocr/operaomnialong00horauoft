HORATII FLACCI

“ Non ego,'’ narrantem, “temere edi luce profesta
Quidquam praeter olus fumosae cum pede pernae.
Ac mihi seu longum post tempus venerat hospes,
Sive operum vacuo gratus conviva per imbrem

Sed pullo atque haedo ; tum

Ac venerata Ceres, ita culmo surgeret alto,

describe them.] Comm. Cruq q. interprets

‘dup lice’ by ‘bifidass [“ Teste Gargano
Siculi has nunc vocant chiappe di flchi,
ubi cum siccantur, una inversa in-
versae alteri cogitur et retinent molli·
tiem'' (Orelli). 'rhe‘ duplex ficus' is still
made in the island of Ischia near Naples
by splitting open from the broad end a fig,
and leaving the two narrow ends attached =
another fig, split open the same way, is
placed on the first so that the two insides
fit, and a double fig is made]

“ After this

’ we amused ourselves by drinking with ‘cul-

pa’ for our ‘magisterss or ‘rex bibendi?
συμποσίαρχος.” Perhaps they agreed as to
some mode of drinking, and established a
penalty for the transgression of it, which
transgression (‘culpa ') was to do that
which at drinking parties, where a presi-
dentwas appointed, he might do arbitrarily,
that is, either mulct a guest of a cup of
wine, or make him drink an extra cup, or

patur ille qui multum bibit-³] In short,
Ofella. means it was a quiet and primitive
sort of way of proceeding, unlike the new
fashion introduced from Greece, and fol-
lowed in fine 1103333, of having a symposi-
arch to preside (S. ii. 6. 69, 3). A scene
of this kind is in the Stichus of Plautus
(v. 4). Bentley calls this, which is Turne-
bus’ interpretation, “ dura et coacta expo-
sitio ;” but as he has no better to propose,
nor have any of the other commentators,
1 am willing to accept it, though the ex-
pression is very singular, and like other
phrases in Horace which have 3 conven-

Quanto aut ego parcius aut vos, -

tional aspect, we may have to go further
than the surface for the explanation of it.
Bentley can only suggest the substitution
of ‘cupa’ for ’ culpa,’ and by ‘cupa’ he
understands ‘ copa,' the hostess of 3 neigh-
bouring tavern where Ofella bought the
wine to entertain his friend. He also
suggests ‘ nulla,’ but prefers ‘ cupa‚’ which
{Zffsshffffffi} ἒξῗέῗὲῙὲοῗιῖἳωΡοιῗὲἓῗιῖἓξ
113 takes it with Lambinus for the wine-
vessel of that name, which was as big 33 3
hogshead, or with Bentley for the hostess.
Heindorf reads ‘culpa‚ ’ but supposes they
played at some game, and that the penalty
of any mistake committed b either party
was to drink ofl a cupo οἕ33133, which
would be rather a premium upon mistakes
than a penalty.

124. Ae venerata Ceres ita] On this
use of‘ v‚eneror' see C. S. 49, n. ‘’Ita
introduces the object of the prayer. Itis
usually followed by ‘ut' introducing a
condition. But as with ‘sic' that is not
always the case. See note on C. i. 3. 1.

“Sic te Diva potens Cyp ri.' ‘'Ita is the
reading of all the best prSS„ and all the
old edigtions. ‘Uti’ and‘ ut' got into the
text asterwards, till Bentley restored the
true reading. [‘ Explicuit': Comp. C. 111
