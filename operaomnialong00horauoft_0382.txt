346 HORATII FLACCI

SATIRE III.

Horace appears to have brought enemies upon himself by the last Satire‚ aud perhaps
by others, which have not been published. His amiable temper was not very well quali-
fied for that sort of writing, and we may infer from the present poem that he wished
to clear himself from the imputation of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right
with Maecenas and his friends. 'Phe connexion between the two Satires is seen in the
opening of this, iu which Tigellius is again introduced and the peculiarities of his cha.-
racter described, for no other reason, as it would seem, but to serve as a text for the dis-
course that follows, on the duty of judging others charitably as we wish to be judged
ourselves. In the course of his remarks ou this subject Horace comes across two of the
Stoic absurdities: one that all faults are alike (v. 96 sqq.)‚ which he meets .by the
doctrine that expediency is almost the mother of justice and equity; and the other
that every wise man (that is, every Stoic) is endowed with all the gists of art and
fortune from the skill of the mechanic ‘to the power of a king. With a jest upon this
folly the Satire closes. ·

The character of Tigellius is happily described (“ Not one, but all mankiud's epi-
tome ’'), and a tone of good feeling runs throughout the Satire. The language is genia-1,
and the sentiments amiable. The style is Horace's own, as we may suppose. 'rhat of
Lucilius, it is clear, was more after the fashion of the second Satire, in which his
⁴freedom of speech and licentious language appear to me to be aimed at without the
power which he possessed of giving them point and severity. No one who reads this
Satire would wish to see Horace in the disguise of the other.

If there is between the two the connexion above supposed, the third Satire must have
been written at no great distance of time after the other. But it appears from v. 68
that he was now well acquainted with Maecenas, though not on the terms of intimacy
which afterwards grew up between them. On these grounds it seems probable that
the Satire was written about the end of A.U.c. 716, as Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMEN Τ.

Siugers have all one fault—that they will never sing to their friends when they are
asked, and never leave off when they are not. This was the case with Tigellius, the
most inconsistent man in the world. Caesar himself could not induce him to sing
unless he chose; when the fit was on him he would keep it up from the first course
to the dessert ς one moment in a hurry, another absurdly slow3 now with 200 slaves,
now with but ten ; one while talking big, another all humility3 one while conteni:
with a little, another squandering millions; up all night, snoring all day.

But what, have you no faults? Yes, but perhaps not so bad as his. And yet 1 am
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbour’s faults, coolly declar-ed he
made excuses for his own. Why should a man be blind to his own defects and have
an eagle’s eye for his fellows' P He may presently find them turning the tables upon
him. Your friend we will say is a. little hasty, and sensitive, and perhaps not very
polished 3 but he is a good man, and kind to you, and a man of genius withal. In
short, examine yourself, and see what faults nature or neglect has sown in your own
breast before you pass judgment on others.

Let us think of this, how the lover overlooks or even loves the deformities of his mis-
tress. So let us err in friendship and not be too fastidious; even as the fond father

finds pretty names for his ugly boy’s defecta. Let the close be called thrifty ς the silly -
