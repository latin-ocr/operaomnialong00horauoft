it. But there were many different kinds
of private boundaries. Cicero (pro Caecina,
0. 8) mentions a row of olives. “Finis
enim multis documentis servabitur, termi-
nibus et arboribus notatis, et fossis, et
viis, et rivis, et vepribus, et saepe norma-

’ 111108, et ut comperi aliquibus locis inter

arva marginibus quibusdam tanquam pul-
vinis, saepe etiam limitibus, item petris
notatis ; quae in finibus sunt pro terminis
habebitis'’ (quoted from Aggenus Urbicus
by Torrentius, who also refers to Varro, de
Re Rust. i. 15: “Praeterea sine saeptis
fines praedii sationis notis arborum tutiores
fiunt, ne familiae, rixentur cum vicinis ac
limites ex litibus judicem quaerant ’'); and
to Virgil, Ecl. ix. 7. The quotation from
Varro explains ‘ vicina refugit jurgia,’
where Bentley, with little authority, reads
‘refigit:’ “cum non unam aliquam litem
sed plurative ‘jurgia' dixerit,” which is
just what the aoristic use of the perfect
tense expresses. [See Gromatici Veteres,
p. 12. ed. Lachmann.]

[173. Nune prece] ‘Prece’ may refer
to that which one man gives to another3
and a gift is a sufficient title to a thing,
if the giver has full legal capacity, and
there is no fraud in the matter. ‘ Pretio,’
of course, means the title by purchase.
‘ Vi ' is possession by force, which gives no
title. We read of forcible occupation fre-
quently in country places. ‘ Morte ’ means
the title which a man obtains by the testa-
ment and death of a testator, or by the
death and intestacy of an owner, added to
the kinship os him who claims as heres.
Horace has however rather confused the
matter. In the doctrine of possession there
are three illegal modes of obtaining pos-

session, and Horace has enumerated two.
See Terence, Eunuch. ii. 3. 27. Savigny‚
Das Recht des Besstzes, p. 6.—‘ Cedat &c. :’
‘pass into another man’s ownership.' Oomp.
Tacit. Annal. i. 1, ⁶ Lepidi . .
Augustum cessere.’]

177. Quid vici prosunt]
used for any collection of houses. ‘Vicus
urbanus’ was a street in the city ς ‘vicus
rusticns‚’ a village. Here it appears to
mean a villa with the adjoining cottages.
‘Vites’ has been substituted by some, in
answer to which Torrentius quotes Cicero
(ad Att. i. 4. 3) ε “ 8οΡοω Crassum divitiis
atque omnium vicos et prata contemno.’'
[Comp. S. i. 9. 13: “vicos, urbem lau·
daret.'’

— cialabnzs saltibus adjecti Lucani]
‘ Saltus' expresses ‘pasturesss wooded or
otherwise, on hills or in valleys and plains.
Those of Calabria were low and without
wood; those of Lucania were among'the
hills. See Epod. i. 27 n.

180. Dyr-rhem sigilla] 8111011 images
of the gods, of Etrurian workmanship, 10
bronze, which Niebuhr says (i. 133), “is
the material of all the master-piceas that
shed lustre on Etruscan art.”

181. Gaetulo murice] See C. ii. 16. 35 n.

182. Sunt qui non habeant] See C. i.
1. 3 0. [‘ Est qui :’ ‘the wiso man ;’ or
Horace may mean himself, as Kriiger
suggests. ‘ Importunusz’ ‘restless.’]

184. Herodis palmetis pinguibus] Herod
the Great derived a large revenue from the
woods of palm which abounded iu J udaea-
They were most thickly planted about .Ιοτὶ-
0110 and on the banks of the Jordan. The
date-palm is that which most abounded
there.
