His birth would furnish a handle for the envious‚ and he was probably calledan upstart
and lnrd names of that sort. In this satire, which is nothing but an epistle to
Imm-s· he spui-ns the idea of his birth being any objectiou to him, while at the

ARGUMENT-

ἶ '3 Μὴ the blood of kings flows in your veins, Maecenas, you despise not the humbly

hom, such as myaelf a fieedman’s son. It matters nothing to you who a man’s
rathen-was, if he be but a freeman born, knowing well that King Tullus, ay and

whose rorefathers expelled the Tan-quim, is not worth an as, even in the judgment of
ι populace that stupidly worships aneestry. And we who are so far above them,

Decius who had none, and that the censor might degrade one who should aspire to
the senate without being free born, that need not alter our judgment. 'l'he censor
would act right if he did so ς let every man keep his own place. But high and low
