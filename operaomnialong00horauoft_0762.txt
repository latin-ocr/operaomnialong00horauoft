HORATII FLACCI

Summam nummorum vitioque remotus ab omni.

Tu nihil invita dices faciesve Minerva ;

Id tibi judicium est, ea mens.

385
Si quid tamen olim ‚ v

Scripseris, in Maeci descendat judicis aures
Et patris et nostras, nonumque prematur in annum,
Membranis intus positis: delere licebit

Quod non edideris 3 nescit vox missa reverti.

Silvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum
caedibus et victu foedo deterruit Orpheus,

Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rabidosque leones;
Dictus et Amphion, Thebanae conditor arcis,

Saxa movere sono testudinis et prece blanda
Fuit haec sapientia quondam,

Ducere quo vellet.

385. Tu nihil invita —Minerva] See
S. ii. 2. 3. The expression is proverbial.
Cicero explains it: “invita ut aiunt Mi-
nerva; id est adversante et repugnante
natura ” (de Off. i. 31).

[386. Id tibi] ‘Such is your judg-
ment.’

As to Sp. Maecius Tarpa see S. i. 10. 38 n.
[⁶ Olim :’ ‘ at any future time.']

391. Silvestres homines] Horace as-
cribes to the cultivation of true poetry,
the civilization of mankind (represented
under the legend of Orpheus taming wild
beasts), the building of cities, the enact·
ment of laws, and the ordering of society.
“ The Thracian singer Orpheus is unques-
tionably the darkest point in the entire
history of the early Grecian poetry, on
account of the scantiness of the accounts
respecting him which have been preserved
in the more ancient writers—the lyric
poets Ibycus and Pindar, the historians
Hellanicus and Pherecydes, and the Athe-
nian tragedians containing the first ex-
press testimonies of his name. This defi-
ξῐιιῗιῖξέηκῗιιιεῌ εῗὲιξὶίἰιειθῗοὲἔθξέῗιιξ ῗιίἰωηιῃῗὶῖἰὲἱξ
occur in later writers, and by the poems
and fragments that are extant under the
name of Orpheus. The name of Orpheus
and the legends respecting him are inti-
mately connected with the idea and the

worship of a Dionysus dwelling in the
infernal regions (Ζαγρεύς), and the foun-
dation of this worship (which was con-
nected with the Eleusinian mysteria),
together with the composition of hymns
and songs for its initiations (τελεταί), was
the earliest function ascribed to him.
Nevertheless‚ under the influence of va·
rious canses the fame of Orpbeus grew so
much that he was considered as the first
minstrel of the heroic age, was made the
companion of the Argonauts, and the
marvels which music and poetry wrought
on a rude and simple generation were

chiefly described under his name ”
91ἰί1111ἶ,71ιίὺ. Gr. i. 25 sq.). Compare

394. Amphion, Thebanae eonditor arcis]
This legend is mentioned in C. iii. 11. 2.
Homer only knew Cadmus as the founder
of Thebes. “To reconcile the conflicting
pretensions of Zethus and Amphion with
those of Cadmus as founders of Thebes,
Pausanias supposes that the latter was the
original settler of the hill of the Cadmeia,
while the two former extended the settle-
ment to the lower city (ix. 5. 1-3)”
(Grote, Hist. Gr. vi. p. 359 n.).

397. Publica privatis—sacra prefa-
m‘s] This is a fundamental division of
things (‘ res ') in the Roman law. Gaius
ii. 1, διο.

[ς398. jara maritis] ‘ Rules for married
ple,' or the law of marriage. ‘ Mariti '
are husband and wife]

399. leges incidere liano] Plutarch
