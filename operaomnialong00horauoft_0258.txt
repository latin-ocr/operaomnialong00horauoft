222 ῌΟΒΑΤΙΙ FLACCI

Grata carpentis thyma per laborem
Plurimum circa nemus uvidique 3ο
Tiburis ripas operosa parvus

Carmina fingo.

Concines majore poeta plectro
Caesarem quandoque trahet feroces
Per sacrum clivum merita decorus 35

Fronde Sigambros,

Quo nihil majus meliusve terris
Fata donavere bonique divi,
Nec dabunt quamvis redeant in aurum

Tempora priscum.

Concines laetosque dies et Urbis
Publicum ludum super impet-rato
Fortis Augusti reditu forumque

Litibus orbum.

. ὥσπερ μέλιτται. ‘ Ripas' significa the
banks of the Anio. Bentley changes it
to ‘rivos.’ (See C. iii. 25. 13 11.) ‘Ope
rosa ’ describes, I should think, the process
by which nearly all Horace's odes were
produced. No great poet is more arti-
ficial, and few more skilled in concealing
their art and giving it the appearance of
nature. ‘ Fingo ’ corresponds to πλάτη-ω,
which word the Greeks used especially
with reference to the making of honey.
‘ Plurimum ' belongs to ‘ laborem? [Ritter
remarks that Horace had a house at Tibur,
as Suetonius says (Vit. Horat.): ‘vixit
plurimum in secessu ruris sui Sabini aut
Tiburtini, domusque ejus ostenditur circa
Tiburni luculum.’]

33. concines] The pronoun though
emphatic is omitted, which is not un-
Ξιῗὲᾚῖθιὲῗὲῖὲὲέ iifl-1222& noninissnffis
particular force in expressing a chant in
which many voices are joined. [⁶ Con ’ in
many compounds only gives force to the
word. Caesar, Β. G. i. 47, ‘Ariovistus
conclamavit.’]

[34. quandoque] C. iv. 1. 17.]

35. sacrum clivum] Martial mentions
this ascent (i. 71. 5) :

“ Inde· sacro veneranda petes Pallatia
c1v0.’'

Becker, on the walls of ancient ‘Roma
says it was a slope in the Sacra Via from the
Forum to the arch of Titus. He is quoted
by Orelli, who also refers to the statement
of Bunsen on the Roman Forum (Annali

dell' Inst. viii. 238): “ Le ‘clivus sacer’
selon Martial montait au Palatin long-eant
a l’extremite du Forum le flanc droit du

- sanctuaire de Vesta.” Fea, who appears

to have given great attention to the sub·
ject, has the following note on Epod. vii.
8: “As one entered the Sacra via oppo-
site the amphitheatre of Flavius between
the temples of Pax and Venus, where now
stands the chureh of New St. Max-y, he
descended gradually to the temple of
Antonine and Faustina, and then ascended
gradually to the arch of Septimius Severus.
(This read, he says, he saw in 1809 when
an excavation was being dug in frent of
Antoninus' temple, about nine feet deep
and laid with flint.) Passing from the
Gate of Triumph over the Campus Mar-
tius, the Velabrum, Circus Maximus, and
the spot where now stands the arch of
Constantinus, the victors went in pro-
cession down this ‘via‚’ with the prisoner-s
before their chariots, to the site of Severus=
arch, and thence the prisoners were dis-
missed to the prison hard by called Tul-
lianus, while the victors ascended the
Capitoline hill, bending to the left, till
*they arrived at the Capitol? He then
refers to Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 30.

37. Quo nihil majus] This flattery is

repeated Epp. ii. 1. 17. Augustus’ kind· ’

ness to Horace, which, according to Sue-
tonius' life, was unbounded, merited the
word ‘melius ς’ in ‘ majus ' he was not far
wrong. ‘ Divis bonis’ is repeated below
C. iv. 5. 1 .
