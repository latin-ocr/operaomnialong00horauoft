HORATII FLACCI

Quinquennes oleas est et silvestria corna,
Ac nisi mutatum parcit defundere vinum, et
Cujus odorem olei nequeas perferre, licebit

Ille repotia natales aliosve dierum

Festos albatus celebret, cornu ipse bilibri

Caulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.

Quali igitur victu sapiens utetur, et horum

Utrum imitabitur ’.Ρ Hac urget lupus, hac canis, aiunt.

Mundus erit qua non offendat sordibus, atque
In neutram partem cultus miser.

58. defundere] ‘ Diffundere‚' which is
the reading of the old editions and many
others, as well as some of the best MSS„
signifies, as mentioned before, to draw from
the ‘dolium' into the ‘amphora‚’ ‘testa,'
or ‘cadus’ (all the same kind of vessel), in
which it was kept till it was fit to drink.
When poured from thence into the ‘ crater '
to be mixed for drinking it was said to be
‘ defusum,' and that is the only word that
ἢ has any meaning here. This man's wine
was of a poor kind, probably not fit to be
bottled‚ but only to be drunk from the
‘ dolium.' He bottled it, and did not pro-
duce it for consumption till it was sour.

59. licebit ille repotia] On ‘licebit,’
see Epod. xv. 19. ‘Repotia’ was a ‘ coena’
sometimes given the day aster marriage by
the husband. Ι am not aware that there
is any explanation of the custom. ΤῙῙΘ
marriage-dinner was given by the husband.
As that was usually a scene of unrestrained
merriment, perhaps the religious cere-
monies required properly to inaugurate the
new life of the married eouple, and to
propitiate the penates and lares, were
usually deferred to this day3 and the
sobriety of the ‘repotia ’ was probably de-
signed to make amends for the licence of
the ‘coena nuptialis? The Romans ob-
served their birthdays with much religious
accuracy, and with festivities equal to our
own. See note on C. iv. 11. 8. They
took care on every holiday to have their
toga. especially clean. The ordinary toga
was not dyed. The natural whiteness of
the wool was increased by the process of
cleaning, in which it was rubbed with dif-
ferent kinds of fuller’s earth (‘ creta ful-
lonis ’)‚ and also exposed to steams of sul-
phur, which removed stains of any kind.
‘Albatus,’ therefore, signifies in a toga
which has just come from the ‘fulla’ It
was usual for persons who were canvassing
sor offices to have their toga unusnally

whitened with an extra supply of ‘creta'
whence they were called ‘candidati‚’ Theo-
phrastus (charae. περὶ μικρολογίας) speaks
of mean persons as πρὸς τοὺς γναφεῖς δια-
τεινομένους ὅπως τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῖς ἔξει
πολλὴν γῆν ἵνα μὴ ῥυπαίνηται ταχύ.

61. cornu ipse bilibri] The ‘ cornu ’
was the horn vessel in which the oil was
kept. Instead of having a cruet or small
vessel suited to the diuum-table, such as
wealthy people usually had of silver and
others of cheaper material, he would bring
down the big horn, and with his own hand,
lest others should be too liberal, drop the
smallest quantity of oil upon the eabbage,
while of his old vinegar, which would
turn his guests, if he had any, from the
dish, he was free enough. So that the
reading ‘largus ’ for ‘ parcus ’ which Gesner
supports is out of place. It has little
authority.

64. aiunt] τὸ λεγόμενον, ‘as the saying
is? It was perhaps a common proverb,
though not now met with elsewhere. The
old editions without an exception I be-
lieve (till Lambinus), an Porphyrion, have
‘angit’ for ‘aiunt’ Fea says it appears
in all his MSS„ which is hardly eredible 3
and he edits ‘angit.' All Oruquius' but
two of little value had ‘aiunt-³ Torrentius
edits ‘angit‚' but approves of ‘aiunt,’ on
the authority of his best MSS. The ma·
jority of the Parisian MSS„ and Orelli’s
three best, have ‘ aiunt?

65. Mundus erit qua non] ‘A man will
be decent so far as (‘ qua ') not to offend
by meanness, [‘ and so far as not to be an
object of pity or contempt (miser) in
either way of living.’ He will not fall
into either extreme. Orelli sup that
the genitive ‘ cultus ’ depends on ¹ miser.’]

67. Albuci senis] See S. i. 48, n. What
more is given by the Scholiasts is not
worth repeating, for it is only drawn from
the tcxt as any one may see. ‘ Didere,’ to
