HORATII FLACCI

Ut propius spectes lacrimosa poemata Pupi,
An qui Fortunae te responsare superbae
Liberum et erectum praesens hortatur et aptat?

Quodsime populus Romanus forte roget, cur

Non ut porticibus sic judiciis fruar isdem,

Nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit,
Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni

Respondit referam: Quia me vestigia terrent

Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.

Belua multorum es capitum. Nam quid sequar aut quem ⁴?

67. lacrimosa poemata Pupi] Of this
person Comm. Cruq. writes “ Puppius tra-
gediographus ita movit affectus spectan-
tium ut eos flere compelleret: inde disti-
chon feeit :—

Flebunt amici et bene noti mortem meam,
Nam populus in me vivo lacrimavit satis.”

We know nothing more of him than this.
‘Lacrimosa' is used ironically. As to
‘responsare ' see S. ii. 7. 85. ‘ Praesens '
means stands by you and urges you on,
and teaches you to meet the insults of
fortune with an independent heart and
creet bearing. The editio princeps and
nearly all the old editions have ‘optat’
for ‘ aptat? which is the reading of the
existing MSS. with few exceptions. Cru-
quius first adopted ‘ aptat‚' as far as Ι can
discover. ‘Optat' has no meaning here.
‘Aptat ' is explained by “ pectus praeceptis
format amicis'’ (Epp. ii. 1. 128), which
province belongs, Horace says, to the poet.
[⁴ Hortatur' is very seldom used with an
infinitive by prose writers.]

71. Non ut porticibus sie judiciis] As
to ‘ porticus' see S. i. 4. 134. He has said
that the world are not fit guides, and he
proves this by the inconsisteucies of men,
both rich and poor. If people ask him why
he mixes with them in the ordinary way of
society, in the promeuades, &c., but does
not form his judgment of things as they
do, he answers them as the fox answered
the lion in the fable ; and the meaning of
the answer here is that he found that of
all those who joined the world and made
money their chief pmsuit, none had sur-
vived or recovered their right judgmeut.
Socrates uses this same suble of Aesop in
his conversation with Alcibiades, to illus-
trate the wealth of Lacedaemon, into which
gold had flowed from all quarters for many
generations, andfrom whence none had come

forth (Alcibiades, i. 123, Steph.). Lucilius

(ap. Nonium, verb. Spectare) refers to this
sable. The following lines have been pre-
served entire :—

“ Quid sibi vult, quare fit ut introversus et
Spiigtgreit atque ferant vestigia se omnia
prorsus ?'’

76. Belua multorum es capitum] ‘The
avarice of the world is like the hydra with
many heads 3 if you check it in one form it
springs up in another 3 whom then οι· what
is one to take for one’s guide ?’ Bentley,
without any authority, substitutas ‘ est ’
for ‘ es.’ On the use of ‘nam’ in this verse
see S. ii. 3. 41 ιι. As to ‘conducere' see
C. ii. 18. 17 ιι. On the subject of will-
hunting see S. ii. 5, and compare with ‘quos
in vivaria mittant’ v. 44 of that Satirez
“ Plures adnabunt thunni et cetaria cres-
cent.” There the ‘captator’ appears as a
catcher of fish 3 here as a hunter. of game-
‘ Vivaria’ are preserves. [‘ Viduas,' un-
married women. See C. iv. 5. 30.] .‘ Ex-
cipere ' is the word used for catching the
wild boar in C. iii. 12. 10. ‘Occulto fe-
nore ’ means interest which was greater
than the law allowed (S. i. 2. 14 n.)‚ and
therefore privately agreed upon. of all
the classes ol* money-seekers iu Rome Ho-
race fixes as the most prominent upon three,
the ‘ public-ani? those who ingratiate them-
selves with old people in the hope of be-
coming their heirs, and extortionate usu-
rers. ‘ Publica’ may be equivalent to ‘vec-
tigalia’ (Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 71, Long’s note),
or it may refer to public buildings and
works as some suppose, quoting Juvenal
(S. iii. 31) 2—-

“ Quis facile est aedem conducere, flumina,
Sitffigidd’mjluviem, portandum ad busta
ca aver.

Perhaps the latter suits the context best.
