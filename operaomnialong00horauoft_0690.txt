654 HORATII FLACCI

judgment in respect to deceased aud living authors, the former of whom they com-
mended only because they were dead and gone, while the latter they abused through
. envy and spite. There is something in this complaint which corresponds with his
censure of Lucilius and his admirere written many years before. But Lucilius does not
appear in this poem, in which the dramatic writers are those more particularly noticed.
It appears that Augustus was very partial to these himself, and Horace probably means
indirectly to remoustrate with the emperor’s taste in this matter, and to put in a plea
for himself and his brethren, though that this was not necessary is plain from Augustus’
generosity to Virgil and Varius, noticed in v. 235, aud from the intimacy on the strength
of which he was enabled to write to the great man at all in this strain. The parts of
the Epistle do not hang together very closely, especially after the first ninety lines.
They eonsist of compliments to Augustus ς a remonstrance about the patronage
bestowed on the old poets 3 a description of the rapid growth of art in Greece after the
Persian war ς a complaint that every body at Rome has taken to writing verses3 a
commendation of poets as good and useful citizens and contributors to the national
piety3 a history of the growth of poetry in Italy 3 a comparison between tragedy and
comedy, and a sneer at Plautus and another 3 an account of the troubles of dramatic
authors through the caprice and bad taste of their audience, which at that time is
stated to have been especially depraved 3 an appeal to Augustus on behalf of the poets
of the day; and a reproof to such poets as are unreasonable or officious‚ and attempt
themes too exalted for them.

How much foundation there may have been for Horace's remarks about the compara.-
tive support given to the old writers and the new it is hard to say. There appears to

>be a little contradiction between this alleged neglect and the universal rage for scrib-

bling which he describes 3 or else the profusion of bad verses may itself account for
the preference of those, who did not write, for the genius of former days. Horace has
not a word to say for Plautus or for Terence, but rather sneers at the popular judgment
of them. We may safely say therefore that this Epistle is worth nothing in point
of criticism, and that it does not ra-ise Horace very high as a guide to the taste of
others. It is possible an affectation of preference for the archaic in lang-uage may
have prevailed in some qnarters ; but Horace's censure affects those who on sound
principles of taste preferred the vigour of the old writers to the weakness of the new.
In short, there is no discrimination in his statement of the case ; in which therefore Ι
do not find it easy to follow him.

There is much polish in the versification of this Epistle. The flattery with which it
opens is cleverly written, and the verses towards the end, in which Horace compendiously
states the military successes of Augustus, are terse and elegant. His commendation
of the poet is a fair tribute to his own profession. The description of the vulgar taste
for spectacles is natural, and reminds us of our own times ς and there is enough iu the
Epistle to account for the high estimation it is held in by the general reader.

ARGUMENT.

It would be unpardonable in me to detain you, O Caesar, absorbed as you are in the μ

weightiest cares. Romulus and Liber, the sons of Leda and Hercules, those bene·
factore of mankind, received not while alive the honour due to their great deeds:
they were envied then, but are worshipped now, for greatness scorches those below
it3 but when its light is removed, then it is admired. To you, on the other hand,
we render our homage, even while you are with us, and acknowledge that your equal
has not been, and never shall be.

(v. 18.) But they who are herein so wise, are not wise in this, that they like nothing
but what is gone. Such admirers are they of what is old that they declare the XII
Tables of the laws, the old kings’ treaties, the pontifical books, and the volumes of
