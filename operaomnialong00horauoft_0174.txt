138 HORATII FLACCI

Dulcem elaborabunt saporem,

Non avium citharaeque cantus 20
Somnum reducent. Somnus agrestium
Lenis virorum non humiles· domos ’

Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,

Non Zephyris agitata Tempe. ¹
Desiderantem quod satis est neque 25
Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,

Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis
Impetus aut orientis Haedi,
Non verberatae grandine vineae
Fundusque mendaX, arbore nunc aquas 30
Culpante nunc torrentia agros
Sidera nunc hiemes iniquas.
Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt
J actis in altum molibus 3 huc frequens
Caementa demittit redemptor 35
Cum famulis dominusque terrae

19. elaborabunt] The old editions have
‘elaboras-unt? as referring to Damocles.
But the future has most authority, aud
Horace is laying down amaxim, not relat-
ing a fact. Cic. (Tusc. Disp. v. 21) tells
the story of Damocles with reflections simi-
lar to these. Compare Persius (iii. 40) :—

“ Auratis pendens laquearibus ensis
Purpureas subter cervices ten-uit.'’

20. Non avium] Seneca (de Provid. c.
3), says that Maecenas sought sleep by
the help of distant music (per symphoni-
arum cantum ex longinquo lene resonan-
tium). Aviaries were not uncommon in
the houses'of the rich.

21. Somnus agrestium] Acron and Por-
phyrion, whom Dillenbr. follows, make
‘agrestium virorum' dependent on ‘Som-
nus,’ which destroys the prosopopoeia. Dil-
lenbr., in his Quaestiones Horatianae, has
drawn attention to the alternate arrange-
ment of the epithets in this passage among
many others. He gives instances, and they
are numerous enough to constitute a feature
in Horace's style. “Spiritum Graiae te-
nuem Camoenae‚’' is one instance out of
many. It is said to arise out of the liking
the Latin poets had for homoeoteleuton.

27. Arcturi cadentis-orientia Haedi]
Arcturus sets in tho beginning of Novem-
ber. The constellation Auriga, of which
the kids (two stars) form a part, rises in

the beginning of October.

29. verberatae grandine vineae] See
Epp. i. 8. 4: “Grando contuderit vitas?
‘Mendax fundus’ is like “spem mentita
seges '³ (Epp. i. 7. 87), and opposed to
“segetis certa fides” (C. iii. 16. 30). As
the vine complains of the rainsso Gesner
would have the field abuse the drought
and the storm, putting ‘ agro' for ‘agros,’
and supposing the final ‘s’ to have arinen
out of the first letter of the ibllowing word
‘sidera' ‘Arbore’ means the [vine, as
Ritter correctly says. Comp. C. i. 18. 1].
There is no variation in the MSS. nor has
any other emendation but Gesner’s been
suggested. And yet it must be allowed
that the stanza has an odd appearance, the
tree complaining of the excessive rain, or
the star that burns the fields, or the eruel
storm. If the reading be correct, the verses
are not among Horaee's happiest. But that
is no reason for altering or abandoning
them.

33. Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt]
Compare C. ii. 18. 20‚— , ”

“ Max-isque Baiis obstrepentis urges
Summovere littora ;’'

and Epp. i. 1. 84,—

“Si dixit dives, lacus et mare sentit amorem
Festinantis heri,’' διο.

35. Caementa demittit redemptor] Com-
pare C. iii. 24. 3 sq. :—
