154 HORATII FLACCI

the wavering minds of the fathers3 and departod among weeping friends a noble
exile. And though he knew the tormenta that awaited him, he put aside his troops of
friends as calmly as if 116 were going down to his home at Venafrum or Tarentum.

CAELO Tonantem credidimus J ovem
Regnare: praesens divus habebitur
Augustus adjectis Britannis
Imperio gravibusque Persis.
Milesne Crassi conjuge barbara 5
Turpis maritus vixit et hostium,
Pro curia inversique mores !
Consenuit socerorum in armis
Sub rege Medo Marsus et Apulus,

Anciliorum et nominis et togae

lo

Oblitus aeternaeque Vestae,
Incolumi Jove et urbe Roma?

1. Caelo Tonantem] Orelli does right
Α to take ‘regnare' with ‘caelo,' making ‘To-
nantem’ absolute. ‘Credidimus' has the
common force of the aorist. [Ritter ex—
plains it ‘I have begun to believe,' and
compares C. i. 34.] ‘ Praesens‚’ which
Dillenbr. takes in the sense noticed on C.
i. 35. 2, is obviously ‘praesens 111 terris,’
as opposed to ‘ caelo?

3. adjectis] This means ‘when he shall
have added? It cannot mean, as some
understand it, who place the date of the
ode after the recovery of the standai-ds from
Phraates, ‘because he has added? That
would be an assertion that Augustus had
invaded and subdued Britain, which he
never did, though Strabo says (iv. p. 200)
that many of the native chiefs had sent
embassies to secure his friendship. Horace’s
object seems to be to divert men’s atten-
tion from the Parthian prisoners and past
defeat to new objects of hope and ambition,
under the guidance of Augustus. [Gravibus
Persis: comp. C. i. 2. 22 and note]

5. Mile-sne Crassi] It was about twenty-
eight years since the disastrous campaign of
Crassus, when about 10‚000 Roman soIdiers,
and several eagleS, were left in the hands of
the Parthians. Orelli says Horace does not
allude to M. Antonius' 108868 111 the same
quarter eighteen years afterwards, partly
because it would have been indelicate to-
wards Augustus, and partly because of his
affection for his son Iulus Antonius.

“ Et fas omne facit fratre marita soror.'’
virgil exclaims with the same horror of

Antonius, “Sequiturque (nefas) Aegyptia
conjux ” (Aen. viii. 688). The disgrace lay
in their intermarrying with those who not
only had not ‘connubium' with Rome, but
were her enemies. [Ritter makes ‘conjuge'
depend on ‘turpis.’ It is difficult to say
which explanation is right.].

¹7. Pro curia inversique mores] Orelli
says ‘pro’ “est demirantis cum indigna-
tione-’³ It expresses vehemenee varying
according to circumstances. It is followed
by the nominative or accusative. In the
common exclamation “pro deum homi-
numque fidem!” the accusative is used.
(See Long's note on cic. Divin. in caecil.

)8. in armis] J ani quotes one MS. which
has ‘arvis,' and Bentley adopts it aster Tan.
Faber, and Heinsius. But we may snp-
pose that the Roman prisoncrs served in
the Parthian armies. As slaves they would
be forced to do so, and they might do it
willingly, as Labienus did, who was not a
prisoner. Horace at least makes it appear
they did so.

10. Anez'liorum] This genitive, from
‘ancile‚' is anomalons. Forcellini points
out a similar irregularity in ‘Saturnalio-
rum‚' and Orelli adds ¹ sponsaliorum?
Horace collecta the most distinguished ob-
jects of a Roman's reverence,' his name, his
citizenship (togae), the shield of Mars only
to be lost, and the fire of Vesta only to be
extinguished, when Rome should pei-ish.
Florus (iv. 11. 3) says of M. Antonius, that
he was “ patriae, nominis, togae, fascium
oblitus.”
