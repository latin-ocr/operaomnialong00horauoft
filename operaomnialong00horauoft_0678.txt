HORATII FLACCI

Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam adspice, ne mox
Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.

Fallimur et quondam non dignum tradimus : ergo
Quem sua culpa premet deceptus omitte tueri,

Ut penitus notum, si tentent crimina, serves

Tuterisque tuo fidentem praesidi03 qui

Dente Theonino cum circumroditur, ecquid

Ad te post paulo ventura pericula sentis?
Nam tua res agitur paries cum proximus ardet,

Et neglecta solent incendia sumere vires.

trumpery present, or be cruel and refuse
it you.' This seems to be the meaning:
the patron may take it into his head to
gratify his dependant with a present of
the slave he admires, and then think he
has done enough for him, or he may refuse
to make him the present, and this would
give him pain.

‘tradere.']

79. deceptus omitte tueri] ‘ When once
you have found yourself deceived, do not
take him under your protection, but re-
serve your influence for one you thoroughly
know, that if need be you may be able to
shelter him from culumny3 for when the
good are slandered what do you suppose
may not huppen to yourself Ρ ³ The Scho-
liasts say Theon was a man of malignant

and buy a rope to hang himself.

[82. ecquid—sentis] The sense is,
‘ don't you see at all‚’ &c.‚ as in Terence,
Andria, 5. 2. 30, ‘ecquid te pudet,’ ‘have
you-no shame Ρ ’ So Livy. 4, e. 3, ‘ecquid
sentitis in quanto contemptu vivatis? ’
which Forcellini correctly translates,

91. Potores bibuli media de noete]
This verse is omitted in several old MSS„
including all the Parisian, except that two
of the later ones have it as a correction.
But most MSS. have it, and all the edi-
tions. Orelli puts it in brackets, and
Bentley suspects it to be an interpolation,
but he substitutes ‘liquidi’ for ‘bibu1i,’
and ‘luce’ for ‘nocte,' if the verse is to
stand. His emendation may be dispensed
with, but the verse must remain till a
better can be found, for a subject is re-
quired for ‘oderunt.' ‘De media nocte’
is ‘ after midnight,' as ‘media de luce’ in
Epp. i. 14. 34, of which verse this is a re-
petition. (See S. ii. 8. 3η.) [‘ Falerni’
depends on ‘bibuli.']

93. Noctua-nos—vaporee'l The majority
of MSS. and the oldest editions have ‘te-
pores‚’ which Bentley edits [also Ritter
and Kriiger} Most modern editors have,
Ι think rightly, on the authority of some
good MSS„ though against the best,
adopted ‘vaporeS‚' which appears in As·
censius' edition of 1519 and most of the
sixteenth century. Either word must be

taken to signify the feverish heats that
follow much drinking.

95. obscuri] ‘Rem-ved?
