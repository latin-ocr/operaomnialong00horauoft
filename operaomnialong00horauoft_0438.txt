HORATII FLACCI

Exirem3 plures calones atque caballi

Pascendi, ducenda petorrita.

Ire licet mulo vel si libet usque Tarentum,

Nunc mihi curto

Mantica cui lumbos onere ulceret atque eques armos :
Objiciet nemo sordes mihi quas tibi, Tilli,

Cum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur

Te pueri lasanum portantes oenophorumque.

Hoc ego commodius quarn tu, praeclare senator,
Quacunque libido est,

Milibus atque aliis vivo.

Incedo solus 3 percontor quanti olus ac far ;

104. curto ire licet mulo] Forcellini in-
terprets this, after Comm. Cruq.‚ ‘ docked.'
Orelli says this is only an English
practice, and supposes it to have been
unknown to the Romans. But whoever
Cruquius' mysterious Scholiast may have
been, he was not an Englishman‚ nor of
very modern times. He must have seen
‘docked' horses, for no man would ima-
gine them that had not. Orelli interprets
‘curto’ ‘cheap,' as “Tecum habita et
noris quam sit tibi curta supellex ’' (Pers.
S. iv. 52). Others suppose it to be a stout
short-bellied animal. [‘ Curto' probably,
11)ἷὲξέζὶᾗὲ {zffffspss‘zp332213?}÷3¹²¹{ '⁵335
speaks of ‘equus curtus‚’ a horse whose
tail has been cut off ; ‘a miserable mule,'
Doederlein.]

105. usque Tarentum] Along the most
frequented of all the roads, the Via Appia,
and to the farthest part of Italy, carrying
his portmanteau [or saddle-bags] behind
him. Public officers could not go beyond
a certain distance from Rome without the
permission of the senate.

107. Tuli] Orelli and Ritter assume
that this is the person mentioned before
(v. 24) as military tribune, and that he
was afterwards made praetor. But I do
not see why Horace should have men-
tioned him in the lower office at a time
when he must have held a higher. He
appears to have been a parsimonious per-
son, going into the country with no com-
pany of friends, but only five slaves to
attend him (see S. i. 3. 11y n.)‚ carrying a
jar of their master's eheap wine, and a
utensil that ill rep1 esented the dignity of
his curule chaii. [‘ Lasanum’ also sig ni-
fies a cooking- vessel, and so itis explained
here by some critias. The careful praetor
would ycook his food on the road, and not
enter an inn. Ritter sayS. ‘risum in sor-

jectured

dibus Tillii sequitur lasanum componendo
cum oenophoro.’] The Via Tiburtina left
Rome by the Esquiline gate, and bore that
name as far as Tibur, from whence the
Via Valeria completed the communication
with Aternum on the Adriatic.

111. Milibus atque aliis] This is the
reading of all the MSS. Lambinus con·
‘ multis, ’ and Heindorf has
adopted that word, considering that

‘milia' in the pluralis always a substan-
tive. See note on S. ii. 3.'197. [‘Mi1-
libus atque aliis’ may be translated‘ and
than thousands (of) yothers? ‘Millibus’
must be taken as a noun. Orelli and
Ritter translate: ‘in this . . . and a thou-
sand other things.’]

112. quanti olus acfar] Horace means,
as Orelli says, that he lounges in the mar-
ket and talks freely to the mat-ket people,
without sear of lowering his dignity οι·
being remarked.

113 Fallat-em arc-mn] Comm. Oruq.
probably gives the right meaning of this,
3332& 3335.ssss nfflffl't‘z'ssssss, {ffffi
metas spectatores circumstabant et im-
peritos sortibus et nugis fallebant.'’ ‘ Sar-
madaci' (or more properly ‘Samardaci ’)
is a Greek word, the origin of which is
unknown: it was adopted by ecclesiastical
writers Augustin (cont. Academ. iii. 15)
uses it for an impostor, while Chrysostom
interpr-ets it γελωτόποιος. Plautus (Pae-
nulus, v. 5. 11) alludes to a class of cheats
who frequented the Circus :—

“Itaqup replebo atritate atrior multo ut
sie

Quam Aegyptii aut qui cortinam ludis ,

per circum ferunt ,·”

and Cicero (de Divin. i. 58) declares his ”
unbelief in all those impostor-s that p-re “

tend to prophetie and mystical knowledge,
