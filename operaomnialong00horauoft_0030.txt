xxvi INTRODUCTION.

time. It seems from the Epistle to Florus that Horace at this tim'e ’

had to resist the urgency of friends begging him to write, one in this
style and another in that, and that he had no desire to gratify them and
to sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he never took
any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less energy, as his life
was drawing prematurely to a close through infirmities either conti-acted
or aggravated during his irrational campaigning with Brutus, his inapti-
tude for which he appears afterwards to have been perfectly aware of.
He continued to apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place on the 27th November, A.U.c. 746, or B.c. 8,
in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a few days of its comple-
tion. Maecenas died the same year, also towards the close of it; a
coincidence that has led some to the notion that Horace hastened his
own death that he might not have the pain of surviving his patron.
According to Suetonius his death (which he places after his fisty- -ninth
year, as the text erroneously stands) was so sudden that he had not
time to execute his will, which* 1s opposed to the notion of suicide. The
two friends were buried near one another“ in extremis Esquiliis,'' in
the farthest part of the Esquiliae, that is probably without the city
walls, on the ground drained and laid out in gardens by Maecenas.

The plan adopted in this Edition, of commenting on each poem in a
separate Introduction, renders it unnecessary to say much in this place
upon Horace’s style and character. The particular style in which his
principle strength lay will be always matter of opinion. My own is,- that
he is nowhere so great as in the Odes, and that of these his genius is
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men, while in some
of the small occasional pieces, as the Ode to the Fountain of Bandusia,
that on the death of Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are shown. Ι cannot at all agree with thosewho think that amatory
verse-writing was Horace's strong point. With rare exceptions his
compositions of this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
and passionless, bearing the stamp of imitation, with unequivocal signs
of art, and none of nature. The crowd of mistresses that have been
gathered for him out of his poems is beyond belief ; and the laborious
folly that has tried to classify his amours, and to follow chronologi-
cally the shifting of his affections, I have had occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon an interpretation of the Odes which is foreign to
their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentious pro·-
bably than most of his contemporaries, though his biographer Suetonius
charges him with gross sensuality; but, however this may be, that the
women of his 'Odes are in nearly every instance fictitious I have no
doubt whatever. Cinara⁵ seems to represent a real person; and with
