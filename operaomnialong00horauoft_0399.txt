SATIRARUM Ι. 4.

Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus
Mutatis tantum pedibus numerisque, facetus,
Emuuctae naris, durus componere versus.
Nam fuit hoc vitiosus: in hora saepe ducentos

Ut magnum versus dictabat stans pede in uuo.

Cum flueret lutulentus, erat quod tollere velles;

6. Hinc omniependet Luciliu] ‘Hinc’
means ‘upon them‚’ as ‘ unde' is elsewhere
used with reference to persons. What
Horace says of Lucilius xs this: thathis
whole strength was laid out on the satir·

of vice in living 3 that he

secui-acy on the face of it as far as
it gom, for the criticism touches only the
surface, and the critic could not be mis-
tahm, and is not to be supposed to have
lied- In fact he says below (S, 10. 3) the
most idolatrous admirer of Lucilius could

⁷ · not deny that his style was uucouth. He

there also adds that Lucilius loved to
mix up Greek words with his own lau-
811830 (v. 20), that he was good tempered,
notwithstanding his satirical vein (v. 53),
again that he was very unreserved and
frank (S. ii. 1. 30—34). This is valuable
toetimony to the character of Lucilius and
his writings. Other writers have neither
added much to it nor mccoesfully im-

rate opinion, but in some points (such as
the absurd mixture of Greek aud Latin)
they bear out Horace's statements about
him, which are useful contributione to the
history of Roman literature.

thirty books, of which two-thirds were
written in hexameter verse, aud the rest
in the iambic and trochaic measures.

8. &unctae naris] “Significat sapi-
entem, quin e contrario mungosum stultum
appellamus ” (Acron). Porphyrion takes

‘for ‘cheatingss as in the

the words with ‘versus,' and explains them
to signify “elegantes et decentes ;” the

pse- error therefore of Forcellini noticed by

Orelli was not original. ‘ Mungosus,'
Acron's word, is not in the lexicons.
‘ Emunctae naris' is one who has his nose
well wiped, aud is therefore no driveller.
Phaedrus explains it (iii. 3. 14).
“ Aesopus ihi stans naris etnunctae senex,
Natura nunquam verba cui potuit dare.''
‘ Emungere' is used hy the comic writers
fragment from
ἓξ iflpiderus of Caecilius. (Cicero de Am.
“Hodie me ante omnes comicos stultos
senes

Versaris atque emunxeris lautissime.”

‘⁸ To wipe a man's nose for him, is to im-
ply that he is a driveller who cannot do it
for himself, and hence it means to ‘ outwit’
and to ‘cheat’ him'' (Long in 1000).
Others explain ‘emunctae naris' as ‘keen
scented‚' like a hound. [Compare ‘pur-
gatam aurem,’ Ep. i. 1. 7: ‘durus com-
ponere ;’ see C. i. 1. 18 note.]

10. verm dictabat] See S. 10. 92 11.
The words ‘ stans pede in uuo ’ mean ‘ with
the utmost facility: or ‘ standing at ease,’
as we might say. Heindorf compares the
expression with the Greek proverbial
phrases ὅλῳ ποδί, ἐκ δυοῖν ποδοῖν, ἀμφοῖν
ποδοῖν, meaning with all one’s might ; the
first of which is quoted by Quintilian as a
rustic saying (xii. 9 fin.): “ Itaque in his
actionibus omni, ut agricolae dicunt, pede
standum estss’ [‘ In the most careless
posture and attitude' (Heindorf ); but to
stand on one foot is the most difficult of
attitudes. Horace may mean to say that
Lucilius could dictate two hundred verses
in an hour, aud stand on one soot all the
time, which would make the performance
still more wonderfuh or standing on one
foot may mean that he was paying more
attention to this difficolt fest thau to the
composition of his verses. lagny, ⁶ stand-
ing on one foot' may mean simply ⁴ resting
on one foot‚’ which is the attitude of a
man who is at ease, aud not busy about
any thing]
