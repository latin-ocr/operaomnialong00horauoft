Unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores

We do not know what we have lost in
the paintinga of the ancients till we read
the-c fine descriptione. Probably follow·
ing the nme guidance, Statius speak
‘¹' Auctmnnus” (silv. ii. 1. 217).
lIoeace had a different picture in view
perhaps when he wrote “decorum mitibus
“ ΞιΡΙιιΊίῑ Auctumnus arvis extulit ”
n. .
( o. 14⁷) 'h)e is represented aa quite a.
youth with fresh strong winga, a basket
of fruit under one arm, and in the other
hand a dead wild—duck or goose.
19. libitinae quaestus acerbae] The
Libitina was one of the oldest

s of

In one of Agostiui's geme

divinities. Plutarch (Quaest. Rom.
88) spe-ks of her service being as old as
Numa, who identified her with Venus, in
order to bring together the beginning and
uie end of human life, and he mentions an
'Amtbm ’Σπιτυμβία at Delphi. She was
aleo identified with Persephone. She pre-
filled over funerals and all things pertain-
ἓὶμῖἛ ‘¹12ssss ’ὲῖἳζῑξωψὶῑῖἓᾱὴξῖ
sunm-ala, where the undeffikffi (hence
called Libitinarii) might purchase or hire
them. Alao a register of funerals was
, kept in the temple, and when they were
“ a see was paid= hence Sueto-
· nius, in his life of Nero (c. 39) speaks of
‘⁸ tia unius Auctumni, qua triginta
funerum millia. iu rationem Libitinae
venerunt ;” one sickly autumn in which
thirty thousand funerals were entered iu
tha accounts of Libitina; and in Eusebius’
Chron- mention is made of an epidemic in
tho time of Vespasian: ‘⁴ lues in
Boane facta ita ut per multos dies in
ephemeridem decem millia ferme mor-
tuorum hominum referantur ;'’ where the
ephemeris seems to be the register in this
temple. Horace twice uses the name of
Libitina aa equivalent to Mors. See C. iii.
80. 6 ε ‘⁸ magnaque pars mei Vitabit Libi-
tinam ;'’ and Epp. ii. 1. 49 : “ miraturque
nihil nisi quod Libitina sacravit ;'’ and
Juvenal does the same (S. xii. 122): “ nam
ai Libitinam evaserit aeger Delebit tabu—
hsss’ [See Dion. Hal. Antiq. Rom. iv. 15,
on the registration of births and deaths.
'l'be authority which Dionysius followed
was the annalist L. Pisa]
w. Matutine pater] ’ἔπαυε was pecu-
liarly ι Latin divinity, aud one of the
oldest. As he presided over the opening

year, ao he did also over the beginning of
{22¹⁸- 'gimbffifl‘ssssssdssiefflffbiffi
on the first of every mouth, as well aa of
his own (hnuary), and prayer in the
morning of every day. Hence he ia called
‘Matutinus pater ;' and hence he is con-
founded with >the Sun. ‘ Pater’ was the
title by which he was commonly ad·
dressed, and according to Gellius (v. 12)
the two words were joined thus, ‘ Janus·
pater! See E'pp. i. 16. 59, ‘⁴ Jane pater,
clare, clare cum dixit. Apollo.'' He was
worshipped before the other gods, which
Ovid makes him explain on the
that he was the medium through whom
men got access to the others :—

“ Mox ego: Cur, quamvis aliorum numina

ἔαιξὲῗῗξξὶι’ρι·ῑωο tura merumque fero?

Ut per me possis aditum qui limina

Adszrtigscunque velim prorsus habere
deos.’' (Fast. i. 171.)

'Compare Fasti, i. 63, dcc. ‘Jane' is put
iu the vocative case by a sort of attrac-
tion. (C. ii. 20. 6 n.) ‘Audire’ in the
sense of ‘appellari’ ἂκούειν, occurs again
in Epp. i. 7. 37, and 16. 17, “Tu recte
viviani curas esee quod audis.” “ Subtilis
veterum judex et callidus audis” (S. 7.
101). The word is not commonly used
inthis sense except with ‘bene’ or ‘maless
S. i. 4. 29 n. .

( 21. Unde] )‘ From whom ’ (C. i. 12. 17).
[⁶ Operum primos labores' are the labours
begun at the commencement of the year,
when it was the sashion for every man to
begin to do something that belonged to
his vocation, as Ovid says, Fasti, i. 169:

‘⁸ Quisque suas artes ob idem delibat
Nescigffigg, quam solitum testificatur
opus :''

as Ritter well explains it ς and he con-
eludes, perhaps correctly‚ that Horace be·
gan this Satire on the first of January.
But I do not accept his explanation of
‘vitae labores: which he takes to be the
toils of war, at the commencement of
which the Romans opened the gates of
Janus; and he refers to ‘vitae labores:
C. i. 7. 18, in confirmation of his explan..-
