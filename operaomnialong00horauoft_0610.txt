HORATII FLACCI

Dat veniam somnumque dies; impune licebit ιο
Aestivam sermone benigno tendere noctem.

Quo mihi fortunam si non conceditur uti?

Parcus ob heredis curam nimiumque severus

Assidet insano εἸ potare et spargere flores

Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi. 15

Quid non ebrietas designat?

Operta recludit,

Spes jubet esse ratas, ad proelia trudit inertem;
Sollicitis animis onus eximit, addocet artes.

others) against all who committed murder
by poison, or abetted in such murder 3 for
the provisions of which ‘lex' see Dict. Ant.
p. 285 s .

— eriis nato Caesare] See Introduc-
tion. The 23rd September, Augustus’
birth-day, was one of those days in which
the early part was ‘nefastus3’ that is,
the praetor could not hold his court
till a later hour thau usual. Hence it is
marked in the Calendar N. P. (‘ Nefastus
Prior ’). (Dict. Ant. p. 186.) So that it
was doubly a holiday for Torquatus, and
he could lie in bed without damaging his
cause, and therefore might sit up late with
his friend.

12. Quo mihi fortunam] This is an
elliptical way of speaking, which must be
filled up according to the context. ‘ Quo
mihi fortunam dedit Deus' may do here.
‘ Quo' is ‘ towhat‚' that is, ‘to what pur-
pose,’ as in C. ii. 3. 9, “ Quo pinus,” διο.
Comp. S. i. 6. 24. Ovid has “Quo mihi
fortunam quae nunquam fallere curet?”
(Am. ii. 19. 7) ; and Phaedrus “ Quo mi,
inquit, mutam speciem si vincor sono.''
The best MSS. and many editions have
‘quo mihi fortuna,’ against the metre,
[unless ‘fortuna' be the ablativa] The
omission of the mark over the final ‘ ξ’
may account for the reading ‘fortuna.’
[In the prose writers of Cicero’s age the
plural ‘fortunae' is used to signify ‘res
familiaris,' a man’s property. Ovid (Ti-ist.
v. 2. 57) has ‘fortuna’ in this sense.
Conington (Virg. Aen. iv. 98) retains the
reading ‘Sed quis erit modus? aut quo
nunc certamine tanto 3³³ but it seems im-
possible to explain ‘ certamine tantos]

14. Assidet insano] As ‘dissidet' is
used to signify difference (C. ii. 2. 18),
Horace uses ‘assidet' to signify resem-
blance. It is not so used elsewhere. The
guests not uncommonly wore wreaths of
flowers on their heads, and carried them
in their hands ; and we can understand
their scattering them about the table and
floor, especially when they were merry.

In a picture discovered at Pompeii there
is a representa-tion of a young man and
woman reclining on a conch before a small
table, with fiowers strewed about the floor.
The man is drinking from a horn (ῥυτόν),
and the woman is taking a small box from
a female slave, supposed to be a ‘myro-
theca ’ or box of persumeS. Horace says ε
“ Parcentes ego dexteras Odi: sparge ro-
sas '' (C. iii. 19. 21). Fresh flowers were
probably scattered at intervals during the
dinner.

15. patiarque vel inconsultus haberi]
See C. ii. 7. 28: “recepto Dulce mihi
furere est amico? C. iii. 19. 18: “ Insa-
nire juvat.'’ [‘patiaa·que—incomltus.'
This seems to be a Greek construction.

16. Quid non ebrietas designat] Elior-
cellini explains ‘ designare ' here by “ rem
aliquam insignem patrare, sed cum nota
et ignominia,” quoting besides this place
Terence (Adelph. i. 2. 6) :

“ — quae facta sunt

Omitto: modo quid designavit. Mi. Quid-
nam id est Ρ

De. Fores effregit atque in aedes irruit ;”

on which Donatus says, “designare est
rem novam facere in utramque partem et
bonam et malam ;” that is, todo any thing
out of the common way. If this be the
meaning, and I know no other, Horace

to ‘operta recludit’ eomparegg. i. 18. 16 ;
iii. 21. 16; Epod. xi. 14, and the places
quoted in the note on S. i. 4. 89, “ verax
aperit praecordia Liber.” ‘ Spes jubet
esse ratas, ad proelia trudit inertem ’ agrees
with what Aristotle says (Nic. Eth. iii. 8.
14): τοιοῦτον δὲ ποιοῦσι καὶ οἱ μεθυσκό-
μενοι, εὐέλπιδες γὰρ γίνονται, that is, they
gain courage by gaining self-eonfidence.

reading of some MSS. and of Porphy—
non.
