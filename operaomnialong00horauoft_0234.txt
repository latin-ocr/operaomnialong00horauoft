Thesauris Arabum et divitis Indiae

Caementis licet occupes

Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apuliuum,

Si figit adamantinos

Summis verticibus dira Necessitas
Clavos, non animum metu,

Non mortis laqueis expedies caput.
Campestres melius Scythae

Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos ιο

Vivunt, et rigidi Getae

Immetata quibus jugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,

Defunctumque laboribus

Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.

1. Intactis] Cn.P0mpeius Magnus, and
others had entered Arabia. Petraea; but
’ Arabia Felix which is here referred to had
not yet been invaded. The expedition
under Aelius Gallus was probably after the
composition of this ode. See C. i. 29 Int„
and compare Propertius (ii. 10. 15 sqq.) :

“ India quin, Auguste, tuo dat colla triumpho
Et domus intactae te tremit Arabiae.'’

India and Arabia are again coupled Epp. i.
6. 6: “ Quid (censes) maris extremos Ara-
bas ditantis et Indos ?'’

3. anmentis lieet occupes] This is ex-
plained by C. iii. 1. 35. [lt is inferred
that the Scholiasts had the reading ‘Ter-
renum' instead of ‘Tyrrhenum’ Besides
‘Apulicum,’ there are readings ‘ pulicum,’
‘publicum,’ ‘Punicum,' ‘Ponticum ;' the
last, the reading of the best MSS. and of
Acron, as Ritter says, who has ‘ Ponticum'
in his text. Lachmann, whose corrections
of Horace are generally bad, has suggested
the monstrous line: ‘ Terrenum omne tuis
et mare publicum,’ which Keller has printed
in his text. The objection to ‘Apulicum’
is explained C. iii. 3. 9. Ritter adds that
‘Apulus' is both noun and adjective, and
the apparent inference is that ‘Apulicus'
is unnecessary ; but if Horace was resolved
on speaking of the Apulian sea, he could
use no other word here. Ritter objects to
Lachmann's verse, that portions of the sea,
not of the land (terrenum) are occupied
by ‘ caementa’ (C. iii. 1. 35), which is
enough to dispose of ‘teri-enum? The
‘ mare publicum' may be left for the

reader’s judgment.]

6. Summis verticibus] This has been
variously explained. Bentley supposes it
to mean the heads of the nails‚ “when Fate
drives in the nails to the heads.” His note
on these lines is one of his worst. Some
take Horace to mean that Fate, by driving
her nails (‘clavos trabales‚’ i. 35. 18) into
the ro'of of the house, puts an end to the
work and declares that the master-'s work
is done. Such is the meaning Orelli gives,
and he supposes Horace to have got the
idea from some Greek poet. The Scho-
liasts throw no light upon it. Cruquius’
commentator takes ‘verticibus' for the
human head: “ in vertice siquidem facilior
est ictus ad mortem vicinitate cerebri. '³ 1
like this interpretation the best.

[9. me patres—Scythae] C. i. 35. 9.]

12. Immetata] This 1s ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.
Virgil assigns to the golden age this free-
dom from enclosures· .

“ Ante J ovem—
Ne signare quidem aut partiri limite cam-
Faglelxihtss’ (Georg. i. 125-6.)

[‘ Liberas,’ free from decumae or tenths,
such as the Romans demanded of subject
states, as Ritter supposes. It means indeed
that the ‘fruges' are ‘free,' but it is be-
cause the people are free.]

14. Nec cultura placet] Such were the
habits of the Suevi as described by Caesar
(Bell. Gall. ιν. 1). “ ‘'l'heyhadIOOy districts
(pagi),’' says he‚‘ ‘each of which supplied
annually 1000 soldier-s, who served a year
