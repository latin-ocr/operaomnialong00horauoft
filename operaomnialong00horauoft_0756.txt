270. Plautinos et numeros et laudavere
sales] See Epp. ii. 1. 17011. Horace never
has a good word to say for Plautus, aud
he here depreciates his wit as well as his
versification. Both no doubt wanted polish ;
and Horace does not scruple to insinuate
(in the above place) that it was only through
haste ’ω get paid that he turned out his
works so unfinished. But his style and his
defects were incidental to the period and

’ manner of his life : his simplicity and drol-
lery were given him by nature. Horace
did not admire Plautus, but more learned
men did, Varro and Cicero (De Off. i. 29.)

275. Ignotum tragicae] Plutarch (So-
lon, c. 29) says that when Thespis. was
just introducing tragedy, and drawing
large audienees from the novelty orf the
thing, which was before the contests had
been established, Solon being then old and
fond of amusement, ἐθεάσατο τὸν Θέσπιν
αὐτὸν ὑποκρινόμενον ὥσπερ ἔθος ἧν τοῖς
παλαιοῖς. His first representation wa's
Rc. 535. The name τραγῳδία belonged,
as observed above (on v. 220), to the
dithyrambie songs of the Bacchic festi-
vals, and these are of uncertain origin, but
of great antiquity. Thespis may so far be
considered the author of tragedy that he
introduced au actor independent of the
chorus, who sustaiued various parts under
the disguise of a linen mask. (See v.
192 n.) This account therefore of the
invention of tragedy at the vintage, the
faces smeared with lees of wine, the
waggon with which Thespis went round
Attica, and so forth, may be rejected, says
Miiller, “ since au these arise from a con-
fusion between the origin of cmnedy and
tmgedy. Comedy originated at the rural
Dionysia or the vintage festival. Aristo-
phanes calls the comic poets of his own
time lec-singers (τρυγῳδοί), but he never
gives this name ’ῑο the trugic poets and

actore, The waggon suits not the dithy-
ramb, which was sung by a standing
chorus, but a processioa which occurred
iu the earliest form of comedy. Moreover
in many festivals there was a eustom of
throwing outjests and scurrilous abusefrom
a waggon (σκώμματα ἐξ ἁμαξῶν). lt is only
by completely avoiding this error (which
roets on a very natural confusion) that it

278. Post hunc personae pallaeque]
Horace makes Aeschylus the *inventor of
the mask and tragic dress (v. 215 n.
See Aristot. Poet. e. 4). But he who first
put an actor upon the stage, if, as most
suppose, he gave him various parts to sus-
tam, must have employed masks suited to
the different characters. There were sym-
bolica] masks for different ages and classes,
and there were doeeriptive masks for dif-
ferent ρει-8οης, representing peculim-ines
by which they would be known. Gellius
(v. 7) derives the word from ‘per-sonarQ’
conceiving that they were so contrived as
to assist the-voice. But that etymology
will not do, isit were only for the quantity
of ‘ sonare? “Masks,'’ Manet says,
“originated in the taste for mummiug
and disguisoe of all sorts prevalent at the
Bacchic festivals. They not only eon·
cealed the individual features of well-
known aetors aud enabled the spectators
entirely to forget the performer in his
part, but gave to his whole aspect that
ideal character which the tragedy of anti-
quity demanded.'’ Roscius first intro-
duced masks ou the Roman stage about
A.U.c. 650. The gai-ment Horace means
by ‘ palla ' has been described before. It
was called ποικίλον οι· ἆνθινόν from its
rich embroidery. For the proper meaning
of ‘palla’ see S. i. 8. 23 u. As to ‘co-
