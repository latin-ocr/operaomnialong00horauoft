HORATII FLACCI

Aut ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat.
Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hie puerorum ς
Hune capit argenti splendor; stupet Albius aere;
Hic mutat merces surgente a sole ad eum quo

Vespertina tepet regi03 quin per mala praeceps

authority for it. Fea quotes several MSS.
in its favour ; Bentley only three. Τ110
Scholiasts had ‘ elige,’ and that is the read-
ing of Ven. 1483. The earliest edition that
has ‘erue’ appears to be that of Aldus
(1501), from which time all the editors, I
believe, adopted it till Talbot returned to
the old reading, which Bentley adopts, but
considers it may be a gloss, and substituted
for‘ arripe‚’ wliich 110 proposeS. Three of
the Blandiniau MSS. had‘ eripe, 'which he
thinks supports his conjecture. Sauadon
adopts‘ arripe, 'though Bentley does not.

E‘r’ue is an unlikely word to have been
coined, and‘ elige' w ould form a good gloss
upon it. ‘Eruere' would signify‘ digging
out‚’ or bringing out something hidden.
But it may bear the simple meaning of
, ‘ extrahere.' The true reading, in my opi·
nion, lies between ‘erue ' and ‘elige,’ and
I am rather inclined to agree with Ste-
phens, who says (Diatr. ii. p. 59), “ pro
‘crue ' quidam codd. habent ‘elige’ quod
e glossa sumptum videri potest.” [Ritter
has ‘elige.']

26. Aut ob avaritiam] There is a change
of construction or an ellipse here which has
led some later editors to change ‘ ob ' into
‘ab' with the ablative. There is some
authority for ‘ab avaritia? Bentley adopts
‘ ab,’ and is quite indignant: “indignan-
dum plane—quod editores toties admoniti
pus merum et scabiem impune adhuc pro·
dire patiantur,’' where the ‘ pus et scabies’
is the received reading. ‘ Laborare ob '
every one will see is an unusual construe-
tion, but the reading of all the MSS. is not
on that account to be rejected. The sen·
tence begins with one form of expression
and ends with another: that appears tobe
all. Orelli quotes Tacit. (Hist. ii. 50):

“non noxa neque ob metum; ” and Livy
(xxxviii. 39): “non tam ob recentia ulla
merita quam originum memoria! For

‘misera’ some MSS. quoted by Orelli and
Fea have‘ miser, 'but the principal MSS.
and editions have‘ misera, 'and ‘ambitio'
generally had an epithet of a strong kind
applied to it. Horace has‘ prava,’ ‘inanis,'

‘mala‚’ ‘mise-a· ’and Cicero (de Offi· 1. 25)
says‘ ‘Miserrima est omnino ambitio ho-
norumque contentio-'³ The practice there-
fore seems to have been habiptual, which, if

we consider the evils that arose out of per-
sonal ambition‚ and the eagerness with
which places of, honour were sought at all
times opf the Republic, 13 not surpns ing.
28. Hune capit argenti splendor] Cups
and other vessels curiously wrought in
silvei· and Corinthian bronze, and very
costly (such as Juvenal describes, S. i. 76,
“Argentum vetus, et stantem extra pocula
caprum '’) were among the many objects of
extravagance at Rome. The exaggerated
admiration of the persons Horace alludes
to for such works of art, might be com-
paratively harmless if it did not lead them
into dishonest ways of acquiring them, and
beggaring their familias, as Albius did, of
whom the Scholiasts tell us nothing. His
son is mentioned below (v. 109) as living
in want through his father's extravagance.
Cruquius reverses this, and supposes the
father to be suffering for the son’s extra-
vaganee, the father being no other than
the poet Albius Tibullus, and to have suf-
fered in his property through his son's ex-

travagance, in respect ‚of which missor-tune .

Horace wrote the Epistle i. 4, to comfort
him. This is mere trifling: though Ti·
bullus mentions himself that his patrimo·
nial estate had been reduced (i. 1. 19 sq),
and some persons have assumed that it was
through his own extravagance. ‘ Stupea’
with the ablative, occurs below (S. 6. 17) :
‘¹ Qui stupet in titulis et imaginibus ;'' and
an equally strong word is used in the same
connexion in S. ii. 7. 95. “Pausiaca torpes
insane tabella?

29 Hic mutat merce-5] See C. i. 31.
12 n.

— surgente a sole, ᾦα] This has been
taken variously to mean from sum-ise to
sunset, as‘ ‘Dives et importunus ad umbram
solis ab ortu” (Epp.' ιί. 2. 185), or from
east to west (“ad ortum Solis ab Hesperio
cubili,’' C. iv. 15. 15), which is the true
meaning. ‘ Mutare merces ’ is the business
of a mercator. Persius (Sat. v. 54) :—

“Mercibus hic Italis mutat sub sole recenti
Rugosum piper et pallentis grana cumini.''

‘Mala ' means dangers and hardships.
[30. quin] ‘ Nay,’ ‘nay further‚’ a sense
which may be derived from the primary
meaning of ‘why not θ’]
