HORATII FLACCI

Ut Nomentanus ‘?” Pergis pugnantia secum
Frontibus adversis componere: non ego avarum

Quum veto te fieri vappffiiffi ionem.

Est inter Tanain quiddam socerumque

1selli. 105

Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,
Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.
Illuc unde abii redeo, nemo ut avarus

Se probet ac potius laudet diversa sequentes,

Quodque aliena capella gerat distentius uber

110

Tabescat, neque se majori pauperiorum

TuFb‘ae comparet, hunc atque hunc superare laboret.
Sic festinanti semper locupletior obstat,

Ut, quum carceribus missos rapit ungula currus,

(Cic. in Verr. Act. ii. 2. 71, and 3. 6, Long's
notes). He appears again S. ii. 3. 224
sqq. Seneca (de Vit. be. c. 11) compares
one of this name with Apicius. The Scho-
liasts have confounded Maenius with him
in whose honour the Maenia columna was
raised, C. Maenius, the conqueror of the
'Latius (Livy viii. 13). [Ritter says that
‘Maenius’ is not in the MSS„ and he
writes ‘Naevian' as Cruquius and Fea
do.

1]03. Frontibus adversis componere]
These words go together, ‘ to bring face to
face, and compare or match? Some take
‘ frontibus adversis ’ with ‘pugnantia,' but
that would appear to mean that the man
was reconciling two things at issue with
one another, which is not Horace's mean—
ing. [Comp. S. i. 2. 73, ‘pugnantiaque
istis.¹

1043]- vappam] “Vappa hic dicitur per-
ditus et luxuriosus, stultus, insulsus, qui
nihil sapit ; a vino corrupto et evanido
quod saporem perdidit. Nebulones autem
vani et leves ut nebulae; nam cum sine
certo consilio vitamj degant, nebulis sunt
et umbris hominum similes.’' These are
th'e clear definitions given by Cruquius’
Commentator. [See S. i. 5. 16.]

105. Tanain—socerumque Vwelli] All
that can be said of these persons now is
contained in the words of Porphyrion and
Comm. Cruq. The words of the latter are
“Tanais spado fuit, Maecenatis libertus;
at Visellii socer herniosus;’' and Porphy-
rion adds that some say that he was a
freedman of L. Munatius Plancus. He
also says that Horace has conveyed un-
der these names a well-known Greek

proverb.
108. nemo ut avarus] ‘ I return to that

point from whence I have digresse& how
that no covetous man is satisfied with
himself? 1 adopt this reading with some
misgiving. The hiatus is different from
other hiatuses by which Orelli defends it.
‘ Nemo' appears (Fea says) in the Editio
Princeps printed at Milan in 1476. It is
in the Venetian edition of 1483, and some
of Cruquius’ MSS„ and some others re-
ferred to by Fea. The best MS. reading
is ‘ nemon’‚' which would imply that Ho-
race had broken out again, as at the first,
“can it be that no covetous man‚” διο.
That does not read pleasantly. [“ Vetus
Blandinius, qui in Semonibus omnes
codices superat, clare sic scriptum habet,
‘nemo ut.' ’³ Ritter.] But Lambinus,
Bentley, Fea, Heindorf, and many others
have ‘nemon'5’ and Heindorf argues, from
the harshness of the transition, that the
Satire is an early production ;-a bad
argument. Other readings there are, as
‘nemo ut sit avarus’ (which was that of
the Scholiasts)‚ ‘ qui nemo ut avarus ;' but
they do not give a clear meaning. ‘Re-
deamus‚’ or ‘ redeundum: would get rid of
the difficu1t55 but they have no authority.
I do not agree with Dillenbrsthat the fear
of the hiatus in this place which has led
to the above corrections is “ ineptus timor.”
Ι do not like it at all. Horace qualifies
the general assertion he made at the out-
set by limiting his remark to the avari-
cious. See note on v. 285 and on ‘laudet'
see v. 3.

110. Quodque aliena capella] Porphy-
rion calls this a proverbial saying, quoting
Ovid (A. A. i. 349) :—

“ Fertilior seges est alienis semper in agris ;
Vicinumque pecus grandius uber
habet?
