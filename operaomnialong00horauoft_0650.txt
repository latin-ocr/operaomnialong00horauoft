EPISTLE XIV.

Horace appears to have had a discontented ‘villicus' or steward of his property,
whom he had promoted to that post From having been originally one of the lower sort
of slaves in the town establishment. While in that position he sighed for what he
thought must be the superior freedom of the country; but as soon as he had reached ’
the highest place he could be trusted with on the farm, he began to regret the former
days when he could get access to the tavern, and cookshop, and brothel, forgetting, as
is common, the vexations that had made him long for deliverance before. This man’s
discontent suggested to Horace this Epistle. It is such only in form, for we are not
to suppose it was ever sent to the ‘ villicus? Horace means to describe his own feel·
ings in respect to the country, and the change in his habits and character, and at the
same time to draw a. moral from his slave’s conduct, as to the temper of those who
never know what they want, who are euvious, discontented, and lazy.

There is no clue to the date.

ARGUMENT.

Steward of my dear woods and fields, which you despise, though five respectable
families they maintain, and send up as many good fathers to Varia, let us see which
can root obt the thorus quickest, you from the soil, or I from my breast, and whether
Horace or his land is best. Lamia's sorrow keeps me here, but my heart yearns to
be where you are. 1 love a country life, you love a town; and of course he who envies
another's lot dislikes his own. Each lays the blame on the place he is in, whereas
the fault is in his own breast. While you were a common slave in the town you used
to sigh for the country 3 now you long for the town. 1 am consistent as you know
aud am loth to depart when business forces me to Rome. Our tastcs are different,
