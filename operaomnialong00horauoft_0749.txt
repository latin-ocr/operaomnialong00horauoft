Gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi,
Cereus in vit-ium flecti, monitoribus asper,
Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris,

Sublimis cupidusque et amata relinquere pernix.

Conversis studiis aetas animusque virilis

Quaerit opes et amicitias, inservit honori,
Commisisse cavet quod mox mutare laboret.
Multa senem circumveniunt incommoda, vel quod

Quaerit et inventis miser abstinet ac timet uti,

170

Vel quod res omnes timide gelideque ministrat,
Dilator, spe longus, iners, avidusque futuri,
Difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti

Se puero, castigator censorque minorum.

Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Ne forte seniles

Multa recedentes adimunt.

175

Mandentur juveni partes pueroque viriles,
Semper in adjunctis aevoque morabimur aptis.
Aut agitur res in scenis aut acta refertur.

person’s functione ceased when the boy
assumed the ‘top virilis? ‘Campi‚’ as
elsewhere, means the Campus Martius:
The characteristica of,youth and age here
given are nearly the same asin Aristotle
(Bhet. ,ἰὶ. 12 sq. y). ‘Sublimis cupidusque '
ωῗῗιὲἰ Βέσῇα-ξῖῗῗπζὲἳίξὶἒιέ is aslave to
ambition.’ He seeks the‘ honores' or high
offioes of the state]

[169. senem] Aristone, Rhet. ii. 13,
describes the characteristics of the old
man.

173. spe longus] “Quia tardus est et
difficilis ad sperandum, propter experien-
tiam fallacis fortunae '’ (Forcellini). Other
interpretatione have been given, but Ι be-
lieve that this is the true one. Bentley
substitutes‘ lentus’ out of his own head.
‘Avidus futuri’ means I suppose‘ eager to
live longer? or ‘greedy of life! [Bentley
has‘ pavidusque futuri. ’]

175. Multa ferunt anni] See C. ii. 5.
1411„ andEpp ii. 2. 55. The remarkseems
to be drawnp forth by the dark picture of
old age contained in the preceding verses.
It has not much otherwise to do with the
subject. [Years as they come are the time
of youth, when there is hope for the
futura]

178. adjunctis aevoque morabimur ap-
tis] Both ‘adjunctis ' and ‘aptis ’ go with
‘aevo,’ ‘we shall dwell upon that which

belongs and is fitted to the age we have in
hand?

179. out aeta refertur] The following
remarks of Miiller (Hist. Gr. Lit. i. 307)
appear to be true :—“ The actions to which
no speech is attached, and which do not
serve to develope thoughts and feelings, are
imagined to pass behind or without the
scene, and are only related on the stage.
Hence the importance of the parts of mes-

poet was not influenced only by the reason
given by Horace (vv. 185 sqq. ); there was
also the far deeper general reason, that it
is never the outward act with which the
interest of ancient tragedy is most inti-
mately bound up. Τὶιθ action is interna]
