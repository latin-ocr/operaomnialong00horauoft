A hard- worked soldier would feel

’1. Quid aa», munitur] Ι have not
inserted 1118 usual note of interroga'tion

each used as introductory to something
that illustr-ates, or explains, or accounts
for what has just been said. They intro-
duce an example, or they carry on 88
argument, or something of that sort. It
is not difficult to see how that couventional
sense may have become connected with the
word ‘ quid: but 18 explain it by an ellipse,
as‘ ‘quid ost enim quod contradici queat Ρ

point the words as 10 18(118818 11181 mean

it to its possible elements. Any language
