HORATII FLAC CI

Si quia Graecorum sunt antiquissima quaeque

Scripta vel optima Romani pensantur eadem

Scriptores trutina, non est quod multa loquamur: · 3ο
Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri 3

Venimus ad summum fortunae3 pingimus atque

Psallimus et luctamur Achivis doctius unctis.

Si meliora dies ut vina poemata reddit,

Scire velim chartis pretium quotus arroget annus. 35
Scriptor abhinc annos centum qui decidit inter

Perfectos veteresque referri debet, an inter

Viles atque novos? Excludat jurgia- finis.

Est vetus atque probus centum qui perficit annos.

Quid, qui deperiit minor uno mense vel anno, 40
Inter quos referendus erit‘? veteresne poetas,

An quos et praesens et postera respuat aetas?

Iste quidem veteres inter ponetur honeste

Qui vel mense brevi vel toto est junior anno.

Utor permisso caudaeque pilos ut equinae 45

Paulatim vello et demo unum,

that the muses themselves had uttered
them (not on Parnassus, but) on the Alban
Mount ; that the Muses had changed their
habitation to dwell in Latium. Doering
and some others think that by the Muses
on the Alban Mouut Horace means Egeria,
who was countcd a tenth Musc.

29. pensantur eadem scriptores trutina]
See S. i. 3. '72 n.

31. Nil intra est oleam] This may be a
proverb. The meaning is not difficult to
see. ‘ If we are to believe that as the
oldest poets of Greeee (Homer at the head
of them) are the best, therefore Roman
pocts must be judged by thc same rule,
there is no use in talking ; we are to be-
lieve any absurdity, to disbclieve our eyes,
and deny the most palpable truths ς the
olive is hard without and the nut is soft 3
we may eongratulate oui-solves 3 of course
our painters, our musianus, our athletes,
are better than those of Greeee‚' which
every one knows is not the case.

35. quotue arroget annus] Sec C. iv. 14.
40 n. Horace uses ‘decidere’ (v. 36) in
the same sense in C. iv. 7. 14. [Epp. i..5.
3 : ‘ tu quotus esse velis, rescribe.’]

[39. Est vetus] This is the supposed
answer to the indirect question 3 as ‘ Iste
quidem . . . junior anno’ is the answer to
the second question]

45. caudaeque pilo-⁹ ut equinae] When
the soldicrs of Sertorius insisted on attack-

demo et item unum,

ing the enemy against his wish, and were

beaten, he took the following means of

showing them their error and the policy he
chose to pur-sue. He put before them two
horses, one old and infirm, the other young
and fresh with a remarkably fine tail. A
strong man stood by the old horse, a small
man by the young one. They were desired
to pull the hair out of the tails of the ani·
mals, and the strong man pulled at his
with great force, while the little man pro-
ceeded to pull out the hairs of the other one
by one. The weak man soon aceomplished
his work, while the strong man of course
failed. (Plutarch, Sert. c. 16.) Horace
appears to refer to this story, which was
probably well known. The application here
is plain, though it has no very close ana.-
logy to the original.

46. demo et item] ‘ Etiam' is the read-

ing of all the old editions and of some ,
⁴modern (Doering, Ritter, and Kriiger).

Bentley, on the authority of several MSS„
since confirmed by others, including two of
the oldest Parisian, introduced ‘ et item? as
being less likely to have been invented than
‘ etiam? He quotes Terence, Andria (i. 1.
49): ‘⁶ Sed postquam amans accessit pre-
tium pollicens Unus et item alter ;'' and
Lucretius (iv. 551) :—

“ Asperitas autem vocis fit ab asperitate
Prtisscipiorum et item levor levore crea-
