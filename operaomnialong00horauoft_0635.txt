pieces of different marbles with which the
floors were laid, ‘ toesellae' or ‘ crustulae ’
as they were called. Augustinus (de Ordine
i. 2) uses the illustration of a mosaic to
show the folly of those who look only to
small parts of the divine dispensations
rather than to the whole, and he uses Ho-
race’s word ‘ lapilli ε’ “ Sed hoc pact0, si

c. 24) says that these ‘pavimenta' (λιθό-
στρωτα ) were first introduced by Sulla, who
had one made for the temple ofFortune at
Praeneste. He also gives directions sor
laying the substratum of such floors, and
they have been found to correspond with
some foundations that have been disco-
vered, particularly in the Roman villa at
Northleigh in Oxfordshire. The founda-
tion was laid seven feet deep, and consisted
of different lay ers of rubble, ashes, broken
