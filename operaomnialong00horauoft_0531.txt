84. Mes-ibae patulis] The shell -fish
called ‘pecten' was found· ιιι greatest per·
fection at Tarentum. Swinburne gives a
list of shell- fish found in the Tarentine
wate-s, amounting⁰ ιιι number ω 93. Pliny

xxxii. c.11) says the ‘pecten’ was also
d ιιι great abnndance and ρει-1001103 at
11 ene. It must have been one of the bi-
ved sort, called by Aristotle ἆνάπνχα,
“opposed to thosey that were μονόθυρα
(Hine. Anim. iv. 4). whether it was the
ζὲἰῖῗῴῖἳῖἷ ἕὲ ῗιῗὲ ῗιῷἣῗῗὲἳὶέἳὲἕ
tacemn tribes, osten exceeding two feet‘ ιιι
length. Cicero (de Fin. iii. 19. 63) men-
tions it as attended by a small animal
called ‘pinuoteres,' because it acted as
watchman to the pinna, warning it of the
of its prey or its enemies. When
danger is at hand, the little creature jumps
into the opening of the shells‚ which close
directly. The same animal is still found
among the foelers of the pinna, and the
Italiam call it ‘'caux-ella. “But more ac-
curate offlervers? say s Swinburne, “have
discovered that the poor shrimpis no more
than a prey itself‚ and by no means a sen-
tiucl for the muscle, which in its turn fire-
quently falls a victim to the wiles of the
Polypus Octopedia. In very calm weather
this rapacious pirate may be scen stealing
towards the yawning shells with a pebble
in his clami, which 110 darts so dexterously
into the aperture that the cannot
shut itself up close enough to pinch off
the seelers of its antagonist or save its flesh
from his ravenous wothl’ This illustrates
the epi ’thet ‘patulis.’ ‘Pectinesf are
the Greek κτένες. The pinna “fastens
itself to the stones by its hinge, and
throws out a large tufi:y of silky threads,
which float and play about to allure small
fishl’ This bunch is called ‘lana pinna·
itis taken off and dried, and combed out
and carded; and of the thread thus made,
mixed with a little silk, the Italian women
knit stoekings, gloves, and caps.

34. molle Tarentum] The degenerata
character of the Tarentina, which gained
their city the epithets ‘’molle‚ ‘imbelle’
(Epp' 1. 7. 45), datm from the death of
Archytas, about the middle of the fourth
century B.c. Among other symptoms of
this degener-acy it is recorded that their
calendar contained more festivals than

there were days in the year. Tarentum
was the only emporium of those parts,
because (until that of Brundusium was
formed, long asterwaxds) it had the
only hai-bour on the eastern side of
Italy, to which all the traffic of Greece,
Illyricum, and Asia naturally flowed. The
Tarentines had a large standing army with
which Archytas gained many victor-ies:
they had a fine fleet, and many cities were
subject to them. Tarentum itself, which
now is said to coutaiu about 18,000 inha-
bitants, in the days of its power contained
300‚000. It flourished no less in arts than
in war and commerce. Thoee it retained
aster it had ceased to be powerful, and the
number of edifleoe was t, especially,
as might be expected, those that were (10-
voted to amusement. The coins of Taren-
tum are among the finest specimens that
we ‘The modern Tarentines, as
much as their poverty will allow them,
seem to cop py the gentle indolent manners
of their forefathers, citizens of ‘molle
Tarentum? They are still passionately
fond of amnsements, and eager only' ιιι the
pursuit of pleasure. Their addroes is
affable and pleasing to strangers; their
pronunciation lisping, and softer than
that of the natives of the neighbouring
provinces '’ (Swinbme, vol. i. p. 269).

examined the principles of flavours.’]

37. cara pisces avfflere mensa] ‘Men-
sa’ is the fishmonger's board, which is
called dear instead of the fish exposed on
it. If ‘avertere’ be the true word, it is
properly interpreted by Porphyrion ι

“Acer-tere.- abstrahere, auferre.” Com·
pare Virgil (Aen. x. 78): “Arva aliena
jugo premere atque avertere praedas.”
It is commonly used with ‘praedass 33 in
Caesar, B. C. iii. 59: “praedam omnem
domum avertebant ; '⁵ and Sil. Ital. iii.
321: “invadere fluctu Audax naufragia
et praedas avertere ponto,” where ‘aver-
tere,' and not ‘avellere,’ is the proper
reading. It may be applied humoronsly
in this sense here, the man making a
booty of the fish he loved. Orelli thinks
it may be taken in 3 like sense to ‘ vertit‚'
to embezzle wrong-fully, to appropriate to
one’s own use, in Cic. in Verr. Divin. 17 ι
“ex illa pecnnia magnam partem ad 30
vertit‚'' where Zumpt reads ‘ avertit ' and
