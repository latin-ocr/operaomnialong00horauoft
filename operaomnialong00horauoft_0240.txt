HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Till now 1 have fought and won. Now I hang up my arms to Venus. Here, here '
hang my torcheS, my bars, and my bow. O thou queen of Cyprus and of Memphis,
do but once lay thy rod upon the proud Chloe.

VIXI puellis nuper idoneus
Et militavi non sine gloria3
Nunc arma defunctumque bello
Barbiton hic paries habebit,
Laevum marinae qui Veneris latus 5

Custodit.

Hic hic ponite lucida

Funalia et vectes et arcus
Oppositis foribus minaces.
O quae beatam diva tenes Cyprum et

Memphin carentem Sithonia nive,

10

Regina, sublimi flagello
Tange Chloen semel arrogantem.

1. idoneus] Orelli’s interpretation, ‘ when
I was of an age to love,' quite alters the
true meaning, 1 think. The words would
be suitable to a youthful lover under the
chagrin of a first disappointment. Ovid
says love is a warfare, “Militiae species
amor est, discedite segnes' '(A. A. ii. 233).

“Militat omnis amans et habet sua castra
Cupido” (Am. i.9. 1). The arms this
lover proposes to hang up in the temple
of mariue Venus (C. iv. 11. 15) on the left
wall, as being most propitious (Cic. Divin.
ii. 39: “Nobis sinistra videntur, Graiis
et barbaris (lextra, meliora,''—but see also
next ode, v. 15, n.)‚ are the torches (funa-
lia) that lighted him to his mistress, the
crowbar that broke open her door, and
the bow and arrows which, I suppose, he
carried as emblems of his passion. The
last two words, ‘et arcus, Bentley would
change into‘ securesque, 'because we hear
that young rakes carried hatchets to break
downy their mistresses’ deors if necessary,

but we have no authority for their carry-
ing bows and arrowa and probably they
did not ς but Horace makes his hero hang
up his bow,·and that is all we know about
it. All the MSS. agree, and the old com-
mentators take no notice of the word.
Orelli quotes a gloss' ιιι the MS of Queen’ s
Colleg e, Oxford, on‘ arcus: “quibus Juni-
tores terrerent'' [Keller writes‘ et ascias:

a miserable emendation. ]

10. Memphin] Herodotus (ii. 112)
speaks of a temple at Memphis to Ξείνη
Ἀφροδίτη, built by Proteus on the occa-
sion of Paris and Helen being driven upon
the coast of Egypt, according to a local
legend, which makes him think that Helen
herself was the Ἀφροδίτη in question.
Where Horace got his notion it is not
easy to say.

[11. sublimi] ⁴ Upraised.’ Compare Te-
rence, Andria v. 2. 20, ‘sublimem hunc
intro rape.']
