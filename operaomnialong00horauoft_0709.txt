Quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi,
Ut patris attenti, lenonis ut insidiosi,
Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus· ιιι parasitis,
Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco;

Securus cadat an recto stet fabula talo.
Quem tulit ad scenam ventoso Gloria curru
Exanimat lentus spectator, sedulus inflat :

Sic leve, sic parvum aet, animum quod laudis avarum

Subruit aut reficit.

his hold and free, though somewhat singu
lar, manner of dealing with his characters.
He takes Greek pieees with Greek ‘·dra

What makes Plautus such a wonderful
poet is, that on this slippery ground he
always shows the most extraordinary skill
in memmi-ig nght point. His language ιε
no lm ble than his poetical skill. If
we compare his language with that of his
we find it greatly altered, en·
riched, and refined, which is a proof that
the was much cultivated at that
time; for had this not been the case, it
would certainly be very different from what
it is in the eomedies of Plautus '' (v. iv. p.
261 ιφ). The language
to the ears of Horace, and hisjokes
and allusions, drawn principally from low
life, or taken from the Greek and adapted
to the common sort of people, did not iu-
*erest him. Horace’s taste was not of a

great talent iu

of Plautus would be

, very masculine order, audit is not difficult

to understand his failing to appreciate

. Plautus.

173] Quium-3 sit Dossennus] Because
n is not known from other quar-
*m nt is assumed by some that the name
is not that of a writer, but of a character
in a play of Plautus. This appears as a
gloss in the margin of one of Orelli's MSS.:
“Dossennus persona comica-’³ Comm.
‚on the other hand, says he was a
writer of Atellane plays. There can bc
little doubt, from the position of the name
here, that it represents a comio writer of

the day. Pliny (H. N. xiv. 13) mentions

- one Fabius Dossennus: but the verses

quoted as his by Pliny are supposed by
some persons to be from Plautus3 and the
man himself Orelli thinks was a gramma-
rianorajurisoonsultuffi nota poet. Seneca
(Epp. 89) quotes the epitaph of one Dos-
sennus, whom Estre and many others sup-
pose to be the n that Horace men-
tions. Some MSS. and editions have
Dorsennus. [‘ Dossennus, persona certa
in fabulis Atellanis? meten]

174. percurrat pulpita socco] The
front part of the stage where the actors
spoke was called ‘pulpitum’ by the Greeks
λογεῖον. As to ‘soccus’ see S. i. 3. 127 n.
It was worn by comic actors, as being a
less dignified order of covering for the feet
than the ‘cothurnus' There is a
representation of it in the Dict. Ant.
Other shoes worn in comedy were ‘baxeae’
and ‘crepidaess for the same reason, each
being a loose sort of slipper, and the latter
not materially different, as obser-ved be-
fore, from the ‘soccus' Horace means
that Dossennus is careless in the composi-
tion of his plays, which he expresses by
his running about the stage with loose
slippers. His only care, he says, is to
make money. The aediles, or any one
who cared to put a new play upon the
stage, paid for it. According to Sueto-
nius, Terence got 8000 sesterces for his
Eunuchus, which he says was a lar-ger sum
