EPISTLE II.

Something has been said about Μ. Lollius, the consul, who was defeated by the
Sigambri‚ in the Introduction to C. iv. 9, which ode was addressed to him probably on
the occasion of his defeat, some time after the writing of this Epistle to his eldest son,
as the person here addressed is generally supposed to be. The eighteenth Epistle is
written to the same person. There we learn that Lollius was with Augustus in the

, Cantabrian expedition, A.U.c. 729, and that he had a brother, to whom some suppose

the eighteenth Epistle was written. It is plain that the person here addressed was

young, and if he had been with the army, he was now practising for the Forum. ‘

Horace addresses him as ‘ puer,' and speaks of his declaiming as if he were still with
the rhetorical teacher ; but these teachers attended young men at home aster they had
left school and taught them the higher principles-of oratory. ‘ Puer' is a word that
might be used familiarly towards a young man long past ‘ pueritia? and, as Franks
observes, it is not likely that these grave views of life would be addressed to a boy who
had not yet taken the ‘toga virilis.’ I think there is much probability in the date
Franke supposeS‚ ΛΑΜ). 731, which would be a year after Lollius' return from Spain
while he might yet 118 quite young ι though when Franke supports his opinion by 1118
reference in v. 53 to gout and fomentationS‚ he only weakens his argument (see note).
Why Lollius is called Maximus in the first verse no one has yet satisfactorily shown.
That he was the elder of two brothers, supposing that to have been the case, would be
a bad reason for calling him Maximus. He would rather be called Major. But this is
the opinion of some editors, and of Orelli among them. That he had the cognomen
Maximus is the explanation of others. [Kriiger affirms, on the authority of Gruter
638. 2, that Maximus is a cognomen of the Gens Lollia; and he compares ‘Maxime
Lolli ' with ‘ Crispe Sallusti,' O. ii. 2. 3, ‘ Hirpine Quinti,’ C. ii.11. 2.] Β111 there is
no trace of such a cognomen in this family: the only cognomen they are known to
have borne during the republie is Palicanus, and the father of this youth does not
appear to have had any. Young Lollius could not have done any thing to gain himself
such a title 3 and on the whole Ι am inclined 10 think the word is only a familiar half
jocular way of addressing his young friend that Horace uses, as in the other Epistle
he addresses him as ‘liberrime Lolli? I see no other way of explaining the word,
which Estre gives up as unintelligible. [Ritter has discovered the secret. The Lollius
whom Horace addresses is M. Lollius, consul A.U.0. 733, and this Epistle was written
in his consulship]

Horace has been refreshing himself with the cool breezes of Praeneste, and reading
Homer over again, and has been more than ever impressed, as 11 would seem, with the
wisdom of his poems and the moral and political lessons they convey. This he makes
'the foundation of a letter of advice, such as a young man just starting in life might
