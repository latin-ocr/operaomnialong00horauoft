HORATII FLACCI

Credit et excludit sanos Helicone poetas
Democritus, bona pars non ungues ponere curat,
Non barbam, secreta petit loca, balnea vitat.
Nanciscetur enim pretium nomenque poetae,

Si tribus Anticyris caput insanabile nunquam
O ego laevus,

Tonsori Licino commiserit.

300

Qui purgor bilem sub verni temporis horam!
Non alius faceret meliora poemata. Verum

Nil tanti est.

Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum
Reddere quae ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi ς

305

Munus et officium nil scribens ipse docebo,

Unde parentur opeS‚ quid alat formetque poetam ;
Quid deceat, quid non ς quo virtus, quo ferat error.
Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons:

Rem tibi Socraticae poterunt ostendere chartae,

affiatu quasi furoris'' (De Orat. ii. 46).
Again he says: “ negat sine furore Demo-
critus quemquam poetam magnum esse
posse ε quod idem dicit Plato ’³ (de Divin.
i. 37). [‘ Misera arte ι ’ ‘ painful, laborious
art!

30]0. Si tribus Anticyris] There were
three places of this name, each of which
is assumed from this passage to have pro-
duced hellebore, a very improbable coinci-
dence. Horace puts ‘ tribus ' as we might
say a dozen or any other indefinite number.
(S. ii. 3. 83.) ι

301. Tonsori Licino commiserit]
Comm. Cruq. has the following note:
“ Licino .· nomen tonsoris famati (famosi Ρ)
qui postea dieitur faetus senator a Caesare
quod odisset Pompeium, de quo hoe scrip-
tum est epitaphium ε

‘ Marmoreo tumulo Licinus jacet, at Cato
Ροῐιέιιέἑῖιὲε, ”parvoz quis putet esse
eos

The name of Licinus is mentioned by
Juvenal (S. i. 109 3 xiv. 306), Persius (ii.
36), Martial (viii. 3. 6, where his tomb is
mentioned). Suetonius (Aug. c. 67, if
‘ Licinum ' is the right reading) and Dion
Cassius (54. 21) both mention a Licinus ς
and the Scholiast on the above passage of
Persius calls him “ tonsorem ae libertum
Augusti Caesaris.'' But he was a freed-
man of C. Julius Caesar, and must have
been his barber if any body’s. Here the
name was probably that of a well-known
barber of Horace’s (lay. (S. ii. 3. 16, 35
n.) [If the above epigram is rightly
assigned to Varro Atacinus, who died

310

before the battle of Actium, the ‘ tonsor ’
of C. Caesar is a different person from
the Licinus of Dion Cassius (54. 21).

302.]Qui purgor bilem] The hellebore
which the aneients used in cases of mad-
ness is a violent purgative, and they tried
to aet on the brain by relieving the
stomaeb. Horace says he must be a fool,
since madncss is essential to poeti-y, for
taking medicines to keep his stomach iu
order. This annual purgation was thought
to take place best in· spring, according to
Celsus (ii. 13). It does not appear that
any MSS. have ‘ qui purger,' though that
form might be ex here.

[304. Nil tanti est] ‘But it is not
worth while to continue mad in order to
have the power of making verse8.']

— fungar vn'ce cotis] As to ‘viee' see
above, v. 86, and S. i. 10. 12. Horace
says if he only kept the bile from escaping
he would beat- them all at poetry. How·
ever, it does not matter, he on ; he
will act as the whetstone which whets the
iron, though itself cannot cut. Thisis
said to be a proverbial way of speaking,
taken from a reply of Isocrates to one who
asked him why he taught others to speak,
but did not speak himself: αἱ ἀκόναι αὐταὶ
μὲν τεμεῖν οὐ δύνανται, τὸν δὲ σίδηρον ὀξὺν
καὶ τμητικὸν ποιοῦσι.

310. Rem tibi Socraticae-chartae]
The writings of Socrates' diseipIes, such
as Plato, and others, will supp y matter
for the true (dramatic) poet, by teaching
him the scienee and duties of human
life.
