190 HORATII FLACCI

Qui Musas amat impares
Ternos ter cyathos attonitus petet
Vates ς tres prohibet supra 15
Rixarum metuens tangere Gratia
Nudis juncta sororibus.
Insanire juvat: cur Berecyntiae
Cessant flamina tibiae?
Cur pendet tacita fistula cum lyra ⁸? 20
Parcentes ego dexteras
Odi: sparge rosas 3 audiat invidus
Dementem strepitum Lycus
Et vicina seni non habilis Lyco.
Spissa te nitidum coma, 25
Puro te similem, Telephe, Vespero
Tempestiva petit Rhode :
Me lentus Glycerae torret amor meae.

‘cyathi.’] The Muses are ‘impares' as 24. non habilis Lyco] The oldest of
being nine in number. ‘Attonitus’ is the Blandinian MSS. had ‘habilix and that
equivalent to ἐμβρόντητος. On ‘nudis’ reading Rutgersius must have followed
see C. i. 30. 5 n. when he interpreted ‘vicina’ thus: “quae

where, according to the common applica-

tion of the word, ‘barbara’ is equivalent But ‘vicina Lyco' is not necessarily his
to Phrygia or Berecyntia. Euripides also wife. “Quem Lycum quare itain transitu

OARMEN XX.

There ean be very little doubt that this ode is imitated from the Greek, though Dil-
lenbr. denies it, as he generally does. It represents in heroic language a contest between
Pyrrhus and a girl not named for the affections of the handsome N eux-chus. The last
two stanzas furnish a striking group for a picture.¹ The passion of the jealous girl, and
the eonscious pride of the beautiful boy, are happily painted. [Ritter observes that
‘ there is nothing about a girl in the ode,’ and he adds ‘neque puer qualis Nearchus
describitur puellis habilis esse solet.' The ‘ Gaetula leaena' is the mother of Nearchum
who would save the youth. This explanation is at least worth consideration]
