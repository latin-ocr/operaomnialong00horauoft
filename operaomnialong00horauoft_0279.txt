Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
Obliviones. Est animus tibi
Rerumque prudens et secundis
Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, et abstinens
‘Ducentis ad se cuneta pecuniae,
Consulque non unius anni
Sed quoties bonus atque fidus
J udex honestum praetulit utili,
Rejeeit alto dona nocentium
Vultu, per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sua victor arma.

C. iii. 2. 19. Lollius was consul ΔΑΜ). 733,
but Horace says that an upright judex is
always on a level with the highest magis-
trates, and such ever was Lollius, besieged
like others with temptations to corruption,
but resisting them all, and so overcoming
the enemies who encom him, and de-
livering himself by his virtue from their
calumnies. This I take to be the meaning
of ‘obstantes catervas? ἀει, though these
two stanzas are not free from obscurity.
DoerIng thinks Lollius was consul when
this was written. Objeetions have been
raised to the construction of the sentence,
by which ‘consul’ is referred back to ‘ani-
mus‚’ which is mere triffing. His heart
was the heart of a consul, which could
hardly have been exproesed more plainly
than it is here. Lambinus Oruquius Bent-
ley, and others, adopt ‘et' aster ‘utili’ and
‘vultu.’ Orelli says that all the existing
MSS. except one omit the conjunction, and
he does so. ⁶ Explicuit' is not easy to
render so as at once to satisfy the etymo-
logy and the sense. ‘ Exprompsitss ‘expe-
divit: are the equivalents supplied by the
commentators. “ Per medios hostes victor
evasit'’ (Landinus). 'rhat it should be a
matter of great merit and difficulty to
maintain the character of an uncorrupt
