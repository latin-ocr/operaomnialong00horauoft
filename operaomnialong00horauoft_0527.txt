 

SATIRARUM H. 4. 491

de se ipso, Haec primus invenit et cognovit estius Miltiades? He does not seem how-
ever to have oboerved that Catius is only representing the words of his teacher. But
aa this person must have been dead many years-before this Satire was written (Cicero’s
letter was written axv-c. 709), it has been supposed by some that Horace introduces his
name, though he was no longer living, only as a handle for ridiculing the Epicuream.
Orelli suggests that Horace's Catius was a fteedman of Cicem's Catius, and a con·
temptible person, notorious as a writer on cookery. Certainly a well-known name
would ωπον every purpose even if the owner were dead, and the former of these two
opinions is probably correct.

'fluat Horace chose a well-known Epicurean as the speaker in this gastronomical
ΜΝ, seems to show that he no longer held with that sect when he wrote it (C. i. 34 3
8. i. 5. 101). That the followers of Epicurus went beyond their master in commending
sennual delights may very well be believed. It is usually the fate of unsound tenebam,

do well to lnve tho-3 and indeed that he had a good opinion even of sasting (Diog-
Inue. x. 127—149). But his Roman adherents did not take that view of their duty,
and under the sanction of his name and school made good living the chief good, and the
nrt of cookery the art of life (sec Introduction to S. 2 of this book).
