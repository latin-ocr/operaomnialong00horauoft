14. partes mimum tractare secundas]
‘Secundas agere' is a phrase taken from
the stage. On the Greek stage there were
only three actors, who were called πρωτ-
αγωνιστής, δευτεραγωνιστής, τριταγωνισ-
τής respectively (A. P. 192 n.). In the
Roman plays and ‘mimes’ there was no
such specific distinction 3 but as on our
own stage there is always 0110 principal
actor that takes the lead, while the rest
act parts more or less subordinate, so it
was with the Romans; and ‘secundas
agere,' though it sometimes applied to a
particular actor if there were any more

mimes, which consisted chiefly of dumb
show, and in which the inferior parts were
all arranged, and the actors played so as
to support the principal character. In
most cases one of ‘che parts was that of a
parasite. Torrentius quotes Suetonius
(Calig. 57), a passage which shows that
‘secundae’ was applied to the inferior
parts generally ε “ Cum in Laureolo mimo,
in quo actor proripiens se ruina sanguinem
vomit, plures secundarum certatim experi-
mentum artis darent, cruore scena abun-
davit? Here the man who played the
principal part is called simply ‘acton’
The subordinates were also called ‘adju-
tores? (See S. i. 9. 46 n.)

15. de lana saepe caprina] This is
equivalent to ‘nothing at all? The Greek
proverb corresponding to this, and usually
quoted in this place, is περὶ ὄνου σκιᾶς
μάχεσθαι, founded upon a story told in
court, according to the Scholiast on Aris-
tophanes (Vesp. 131), by Demosthenes.
A man hired an ase, and in the heat of the
day lay down in the shadow of the animal,
whereupon the owner turned him out of
his place, saying he had hired the ass, but
not his shadow ; and on this they went to
law.

16. Scilicet ut non] ‘For-scoth, that I
should not be believed before any body
else, aud boldly bark out what l know to

be true! Why if you would give me my
life over again I would not accept it on
such conditions. [Ritten I think cor-
rectly‚ has only a comma after ‘elatrem,'
and explains the passage thus: ‘pretium
aetas altera sordet ut nou sit . .
elatrem.’]

19. Castor sciat an Dolichos plus] This
is the same sort of gossip that Maecenas
is represented as discussing with Horace
(S. ii. 6. 44 sqq.). 'rhe Scholiasta say that
these persons were players, or, as others
say, gladiators. Comm. Cruq. has the name
Dolichos, and Cruquius was the first to
adopt it on his Scholiast's authority and
that of three MSS. which have never since
been confirmed. Most of the modern edi-
tions have Dolichos. Bentley [and Ritter]
retain Docilis, the reading of Porphyrion
and all the old editions. Orelli says this
name occurs in inscriptions as that of a
freedman, but he prefers the other. If
Dolichos be right, the name is that of a
Greek slave.

20. Brundisium Minuci] This rond is
only once more mentioned by any classical
writer (Cic. ad Att. ix. 6: “Cohortesque
sex quae Albae fuissent ad Curium via
Minucia transisse ''), and all we leam from
that is, that the road passed by Alba,
which lay between the Via Latina and Via
Appia, about half-way between Tusculum
and Aricia. Continuing in that direction
it would fall into theVia Latina at Teanum
in Campania, a little above Capua, from
which place theVia Appia was continued to
Brundisium. If this were the line of the
Via Minucia (it is impossible to say any
thing about it with certainty), it would be
a more direct route than the Via Appia.
[Ritter assumes that the Alba of Cicero’s
letter is Alba ad lacum Fucinum, and that
the Minucia was either another name of
the Valeria Via or part of it.] The MSS.
and editions vary between the names Nu-
mici and Minuci here ; [but the better MSS.
have ‘ Minuci ' or ‘ Minuti.'] The second
syllable in Numicius is long (Ep. 1. 6). 1
