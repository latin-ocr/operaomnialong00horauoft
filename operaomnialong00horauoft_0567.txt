 

Cum te formidet mulier neque credat amanti,

Ibis sub furcam prudens dominoque furenti

committes rem omnem et vitam et cum corpore famam.
, Evssti, credo metues doctusque cavebis:

Quaeres quando iterum paveas iterumque perire

Possis, o toties servus! Quae belua ruptis,

cum semel effugit, reddit se prava catenis?

Non sum moechus, ais.

Praetereo sapiens argentea: tolle periclum,

79. vicarius] Cicero (in Verr. ii. 3. 38),
speaking of one Diognetus as a slave of
the lowest sort, says, “Vicat-ium nullum
habet, nihii omnino peculii.” The ‘ pecu-
lium' was that property which a slave
might accumulate, and which conven-
tionnlly was held by him independent of

„his master, and among the rest he ιιι 1ght

have a‘ viearim’ s slagve to do his duty or
help him‘ ui it. He was held to be‘ quasi
dominus' in relation to his‘ vimrius’ q(see

sig- Mr. Long's note on Cic. in Verr. ii. 1. 36).

In later timoe it appears that a slave ⁶
might have several‘ vicarii? but at this
time more than one was unusual (Becker,
Gall. Sc. i.n..5) thtDavusssysis,
whether you choose to call the slsve’s
slave his‘ vicarius? or substitute, as your
custom does, or his fellow-slave (as strictly
speaking he is, for except by permission a
slave can hold ιιο property independent
of his master), what is my relation to

slave of your passionS, which pull you
about as the stringe pull a puppet (which
the Greeks called νευρόπαστον). The
ancients carried their mechanical skill in
the construction of automaton figures as
faras snd perhaps further than it has been
carried since. A celebrated instance is
that of Claudius' sham-fight in the Lacus
Fucinus, during which a figure of Triton
in silver rose up from the lake and blew s.
blast upon a trumpet (Sueten. claudius,
c. 21). Artists in this line were common
among the Greeks and were called νεῦρα·
