HORATII FLACCI

Supplex et oro regna per Proserpinae,

Per et Dianae non movenda numina,

Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

In quem superbus ordinarat agmina

Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat.

1. me jam] The repetition denotes
haste aud eagerness, ‘see‚ see I yield.’
They are said ‘ dare manus ' who give their
hands to the chains of a conqueror. See
virgil (Aen. xi. 568) : “ neque ipse manus
. feritate dedisset? Caesar (B. G. v. 31):
“ tandem dat Cotta permotus manus ς su-

nities with whom the witch has most
communication.

4. Per atque libros] This position of
‘ atque’ is peculiar to the poets.

5. Refixa] This word, which gives the
only true sense here (unfixed) has given
place in some respectable MSS. to ‘defixa,’
which has no suitable meaning. virgil
says (Aen. v. 527): “Caelo ceu saepe re-
fixa Transcurrunt crinemque volantia si-
dera ducunt.''

7. solve, solve turbinem] All the MSS.
have ‘solve ;' Lambinus has ‘ volve,' with·
out authority. ‘Turbo' is a wheel of some
sort used by sorceresses: ῥόμβος is the
Greek name for it; and Theocritus intro-
duces the witch Simaetha using it, and
saying (ii. 30) :—

χὼς &new ὅδε ῥόμβος ὁ χάλκεος ἐξ Ἀφρο-
ὦςδιξζῖῗκῗς δινοΐτό ποθ’ ἂμετέρῃσι θύρῃσι.

Ovid also (Am. i. 8. 7) ; “Scit bene quid
gramen, quid torto concita rhombo Licia;”
and Propertius (iii. 6. 26): “ Staminea
rhombi ducitur ille rota ;” and Martial
(xii. 57): “ Cum secta Colcho Luna vapu-
lat rhombo.” Threads of various colours
arranged artificially were spun round the
wheel, and formed a magical web supposed
tc involve the affectione or fortunes of him
who was the object of the spell. ‘ Retro
solvere ’ means to relax the onward motion
of the wheel, which will then of itself roll

back. ‘Volve' is too obvious an emen-
dation, and not required.

8. Movit nepotem] Teleth the king
of Mysia, was wounded and afterwards
healed by Achilles, the son of Tbetis, and
so grandson of Nereus. Propertius refers
to the story (ii. 1. 63):

“ Mysus et Haemonii juvenis qua cuspide
segpgnnnts’, hac ipsa cuspide sensit
opem.

See also Ovid (Trist. i. 1. 99 sqq.):

‘⁶ Namque ea vel nemo vel qui mihi vul-

nera fecit,
Solus Achilleo tollere more potest?

11. Una-ere] This is the reading of the
greater number of MSS„ including the
Blandinian; also of Cruquius' Scholiast,
who says, “unxere—sepeliere.'' There is
also good authority for ‘ luxere‚' and Bent-
ley warmlyrdefends it; he has no doubt
whatever it is Horace's word. Lambinus
has a long note in defence of it, but in his
second edition has ‘unxere' in deference
to the MSS. Bentley says any common
person might have thought of ‘ unxere,’ of
‘luxere' “nemo nisi apprime eruditus?
I agree with most modern editors in think-
ing ‘unxere’ has more meaning here than
‘luxere.’ It is Horace’s pu to show
that Achilles, moved by the entreaties of
Priam (11. xxiv. 510), gave back Hector’s
body, which he had threatened the dogs
should devour (ll. xxiii. 182). ‘Unxere'
would show that the body had been re-
turned, which ‘luxere ’ would not. Thai.
Homer does not mention the fact that the
Trojan women anointed Hector’s body is
an idle argument. Horace only makes
them do what the Greeks did sor Patroclus
