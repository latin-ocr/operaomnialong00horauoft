According to Porphyrion he fell under the
abuse of the poet Maevius (“ de hoc Mae·
vius poeta scribit '’), which places him in
better company than he deserves, for that
man’s abuse seems to have been directed
against the best men of his day. The mad
freak of Clodius is also related of Cleopatra.
See Pliny (ubi sup. ξ 58) and Suetonius
(Calig. c. 37). Aesopus, the actor, was not
less extravagant than his son, see below,

. v. 245 n.

240. absorberet] The MSS. vary be-
tween this word and two others. ‘Absor-
beret ' Bentley first took into the text from
most of his own MSS. and several others,
and the best MSS. since have confirmed it.

‘Exsorberet' was the common reading in
Bentley’s day, and that of all the old edi-
tions. ‘ Obsorberet ’ Orelli prefers on little
authority, quoting S. ii. 8. 24, “ obsorbere
placentas,'’ where the word signifioe the
act of a glutton gobbling down his food‚
which sense has no place here.

243. Quinti progenies Arri] Of the
father enough has been said above (ver. 86

ιι.). Of the sons nothing is known. There
was a man of this name who held several
offices under Tiberius, as appears from an
inscription on a tombstoue transcribed bv
Cap martin de Chau py (Decouv. de la Mai-
son pde Camp. d’ Horace, vol. i. p. 190).

245. Lusa-mim] The second syllable is
long; the third coalesces w ith the last (S. i.
7. 30’ n.). The spirit of wantonness could
hardly go further than dining upon night-
iugales, who are “ vox et praeterea nihil,’'
as the story goes in Plutarch (Apophth.
Lacon. divers. 13), τίλας τις ἀηδόνα καὶ
βραχεῖαν πάνυ σάρκα εὑρὼν εἶτε, φάν να τύ
τι ’3 ἐσσι καὶ ου δὲν ἄλλο. Pliny (Η. N. x.
43) speaks of the eost of a dish of night-
iugales· “Servorum illis pretia sunt, et
