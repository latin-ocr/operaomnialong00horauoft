2 HORATII FLACCI

plough the seas3 the merchant is restless on land. One man loves his ease and his .
wine ς another the camp and the din of war 3 while the huntsman braves all weathers
for his sport. My glory is in the ivy crown, my delight to reti're to, the groves with
the nymphs and the satyra, where my muse breathes the flute or strikes the lyre-
Placed by thee among the lyric choir Ι shall lift my head to the skies.

MAECENAS atavis edite regibus

O et praesidium et dulce decus meum,

Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse juvat metaque fervidis

Evitata rotis palmaque nobilis. 5 ,
Terrarum dominos evehit ad Deos,

1. atavis] A noun substantive, sig-
nifying properly an 811888101- 111 1118 fifth
degree, thus: ‘ pater,’ ‘ avus‚’ ‘proavu3,’
‘abavus‚’ ‘atavus ς’ 80111ρο1111(18(1 of ‘ ad’
and ‘ avus? and corresponding 1ο ‘adnepos ’
111 1118 descending scale. Maecenas belonged
to the family of Cilnii, formerly Lucumones
or princes of Etruria, who up to a late
period possessed influence 111 the Etrurian
town of Arretium, whence they were ex-
pelled by their own citizens B.c. 300. See
Liv. x. 3. Compare Propert. iii. 9. 1 ε

“Maec-enas, eques Etrusco de sanguine

1· 111.”
1118111111,Ἑί 4. 2: “Maecenas atavis regibus
ortus eques.'' Seealso C. iii. 29. 1. S. i. 6. 1,
sqq. virgil (G. ii. 40) addresses Maecenas
in the same affectionate terms ε

“O decus, o famae merito pars maxima.
nostrae,
Maecenas ,·’'

and Propertius, 11. 1. 73 :

‘⁶ Maecenas nostrae pars invidiosa juventae,
Et vitae et morti gloria justa meae.'’

3. Sunt quos] ἔστιν οὕς, which Greek
construction 1188 been more closely followed
by PropertiuS, iii. 9. 17 : “ Est quibus Eleae
concurrit palma quadrigae? The indicative
is used with ‘ sunt,’ or ‘ est qui,' when par-
ticular persons are alluded to, as here the
Greeks in opposition to the Romans. So
Epp. ii. 2. 182: “ Argentum—sunt qui 11011
habeant, est qui non curat habere,’' where
by the latter is distinctly indicated the wise
man. This distinction may be observed,
more or less evidently, in every passage of
Horace, where the words occur (see Index,
‘ qui ³), unless ‘ est qui ' below (v. 19) be
an exception. It is not impossible, that
there he may mean an allusion to some
particular person in a good-humoured way.

3. curriculo] This may mean either
the chariot (formed from ‘ curro‚' as ‘ vehi·
culum ' from ‘ veho ’) or the course, and the

commentators are divided on the subject.
I see no way of deciding the controversy,
since either sense will suit the e, und
both were 111 common 1188 (888 Forcell.).
Because the Olympic games had not yet
ceased to be celebrated after a fashion‚
Orelli thinks Horace may be writing from
his own recollection, having been a spec-
tator. But he is more likely, as suggested
above, to have had Pindar in his mind
111811 1118 own recollection of the faded
horse-races.

4. Colzeyisse] Young verse-writers are
sometimes misled in their use of the per-
fect for the present tense. It can only be
so used to express a complete acuon, or an
action frequently repeated, not a continuing
course of action3 according to the force of
the Greek aorist. 'rho best illustration
of what follows is in the Iliad (xxiii. 338,
sqq& wlhere Nestor thus instructs his 8011
An ' oc us:

ἐν νύσσῃ δέ τοι ἵππος ἀριστερὸς ἔγ·
χριμφθῆτω,

ὡςε {iu τοι πλήμνη γε δοάσσεται ἄκρον

κύιιεῗιξιθῖιι-οιητοῖο· λίθον δ’ ἀλέασθαι ἐπαο-

881111180 Ov. Am. iii. 2. 11:

“Et modo lora dabo, modo verbere terga
1⁴11?ngng metas interiore mta.'’

6. Terrarum dominos] 1 understand this

to signify the Romans, with a tinge of
irony. Mart. xiV. 124, calls them “Romanos
rerum dominos? 88 Virgil had done before
(Aen. i. 282). Plutarch 8180 (ΤΠ). Grac. ix.)
makes Gracchus say of the Roman Plebs,
ὑπὲρ ἀλλοτρίας τρυφῆς καὶ πλούτου πολε-

μοῦσι καὶ ἀποθνήσκουσι, κύριοι τῆς οἶκον-

μένης εῖναι λεγόμενοι, μίαν δὲ βῶλον ἰδίαν -

{ism ἔχοντες. Martial (viii. >2) calls Domi-
la‘1‘1'1'errarum domino deoque rerum‚”
