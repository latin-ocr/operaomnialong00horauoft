CARMINUM Ι. 9. 29

Permitte divis cetera, qui simul
Stravere ventos aequore fervido 10
Deproeliantes nec cupressi
Nec veteres agitantur orni.
Quid sit futurum cras fuge quaerere, et
Quem Fors dierum cunque dabit lucro
Appone, nec dulces amores 15
Sperne puer neque tu choreas,
Donec virenti canities abest

Lenesque sub' noctem susurri

taking down the jar from the ‘apotheca ' or
drawing the wine from the ‘diota' (which
is the same as the ‘amphora,’ ‘testass οι·
‘cadus’) into the crater or bowl in which
itwas mixed with water. Here it means the
latter. The name of the wine is applied to
the vesael containing it here, as in ‘Graeca
testa’ (i. 20. 2); ‘ Laestrygonia amphora’
(iii. 16. 34). Sabine wine was not among the
hest, nor was it ofthe worst sort. It was
a sweet wine, and probably aster four years'
keeping was in its prime. Horace calls it
elsewhere (C. i. 20. 1) “ vile Sabinumss’

from the Caecubus ager in the south of
Latium ; the second in rank was the Faler-

' n’nn, of which there were several varieties.

An inferior sort came from Surrentum (also
in Campania), which was improved by mix-
ing with Falernian (S. ii. 4. 55). Οιι
apar with Falernian he seems to place the
wine of the Alban hills (S. ii. 8. 16). The
wine of the Massic range was apparently
of delicate flavour (S. ii. 5. 54). Among the
costly wines of the rich he mentions the
Calenian from Cales, now Calvi, in Cam·
pania, and that of the Formian hills (C.' ι.
20. 9, 11). The worst wine he speaks of
(S. ii. 3. 143) was from the neighbourhood
of Veii, a red wine (Mart. i. 104. 9, “ Vei-
entani bibitur faex crassa rubelli ”). There
were other wines of different qualities grown
in Italy, the best of which, and placed by
Augustus above Caecuban, was the Setine,
from Setia (Saeza) ιιι the Volscian territory.
Westphal says a wine is still grown
tho-e. The 5Romans also imported wines
from the Aegean and Asia Minor, of which
Horace mentions those fmm the islands of
Coa, Lesbos, and Chios. Of these the first

was a white wine, the second seems to have
been the least powerful, the third was most
highly valued. He of Mareotic wine
from the neighbourhood of Alexandria (C.
i. 37. 14), the vine producing which Vix-gil
mentions (Georg. ii. 91). Βιιι it does not
appear that it was drunk at Rome. Horace’s
