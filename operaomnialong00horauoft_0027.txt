note genuine in Horace’s writings than his. expressions of affection for
h‘u &ther and for Maecenas. His gratitudo to Maecenas never takes

, the form of servility, his affection never savours of affectation, and his

finiliarity never approaches to impertinence. He sees in Maecenas'
gista to himself only the generous disposition of the giver, of which he
hs no thought of taking ,undue advantage3 his patronage he neither
suggentes nor undervalues3 for his health he feels tenderly3 his
danger he tries to share3 and his anxieties he does his best to soothe.
It is evident that Maecenas valued his society and understood his

At· his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
my persons of consideration whose friendship he appears to have
enjoyed. Through Maecenas also it is probable Horace was introduced
to Augustus, but when that happened is uncertain. In Amne. 717
Maecenasmas deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi-
sium, aud he took Horace with him on that journey, of which an amusing
account is given in the fisth Satire of the first book. Horace appears
to have parted from the rest of the company at Brundisium, and per-
haps returned to Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Int.).
Between this journey and ΔΑΜ). 722 Horace received from his friend
the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia (Licenza)‚
situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and fourteen from Tibur, in
the Sabine country. Of this property he gives a description in his Epistle
to Quintius (i. 16), and he appears to have lived there a part of every year,
and to have been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired‚ being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), the centre of the
district, but of no great importance. During this interval he con·
tinued to write Satires and Epodes, but also, it appears to me probable,
smne of the odes, which some years later he published, and others which
he did not publish. These compositions I have no doubt were seen by
his friends, and were pretty well known before any of them were collected
for publication. It will appear from the separate Introduction to the
several Satires of the first book that there is not one which might not
have been written by the year A.1:.C. 719, and in that year Franke
supposes the first book was published. It may have been so, but
Fianke’s arguments are not conclusive. In amc. 723 the battle of
Actium was fought, and in the prospect of Maecenas having a command
on that occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first
in the book of Epodes. The ninth Epode was written immediately
asterthe victory, and there is no poem in the book of Epodoe which
need be placed later. Ι agree therefore with Frauke in thinking that
book, of which one or two poems are among Horace's earliest composi-
fions, may have been published in A.1.⁷.c. 724. In that year was written,
