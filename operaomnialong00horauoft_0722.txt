686 HORATII FLACCI

Unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

Deeisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni , 50
Et laris et fundi, paupertas impulit audax ·
Ut versus facerem : sed quod non desit habentem

Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,

Ni melius dormire putem quam seribere versus?

Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes 3 55
Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum;

Tendunt extorquere poemata ς quid faciam vis?

Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque:

Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis,

Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro. 60 ⁴

But twenty days afterwards a second en-
gagement went against Brutus, and he
likewise put an end to himself. How
Brutus attached to his cause the young
Romans stud ying at Athens, and the bat-
tles and wanderings he led them through
are related by Plutarch in his life (c. 24,
51. Et lari-5 et fundi]
valent to ‘ domus.' As to the difference
between ‘domus' and ‘fundus‚’ see S. ii. 5.
108 ιι. Horace’s patrimony at Venusia was
forfeited because he was of the republican
party. Others in his neighbourhood lost
theirs in consequence of the distribution of
lands to the soldiers (see S. ii. 2, Introduc-
tion). He says nothing of the scribe’s place,
which Suetonius says he bought (with what
means does not appear), nor does he men-
tion how he got his pardon and permission
to return to Rome. He only says he was
driven by poverty to write verses, which
therefore he first wrote for fame, that is to
bring himself into the notice of those who
were able to relieve his wants, as Maecenas
did. It is impossible to tell what he wrote
at first. The language of the text does not
necessarily imply that he was paid for what
he wrote 3 but though Horace never ap-
pears in a mereenary character, there is no
knowing what poverty may have led him
to accept for severe personal satires, of
which there are specimens in the Epodes,
showing what he could do in that way. I
have no doubt he suppressed much of his

early poetry.
[52. quod non desit habentem] ‘ While

Ι have sufficient ;' literally, ‘while I have
what 1 hope Ι may never want.’]

53. Quae poterunt unquam] The ‘ci-
enta: κωνεΐον, hemlock, was used as an
antifcbrile medicine (Pliny, Η. N. xxiii. 13.

‘ Laris ' is equi·

95). Horace asks what amount of ‘’cicuta

would be sufficient to cool his veins if he
were so feverishly bent upon writing, as to
do so when he could live without it. Per—

sius employs the same idea (v. 144)-- .—

“Quid-tibi vis Ρ calido sub pectore mascula
Intiiixsiuit, quam non exstinxerit urna
cicutae.’'

[57. quid faciam vis] S. ii. 1. 24, ‘quid
faciam θ’ This is a way ofsa ⁰ ‘I ean-
not do otherwise than 1 am doing.’]

60. Ille Bioneis sermonibus] Bion was
born οιι the Borysthenes, and was henos
called Borysthenites. He wrote about the
middle of the third century 13.c. He studied
philosophy at Athens under Theophrastus,
and after passing through various sects be·
came at last a Peripatetic. Acron says of
himin his note οιι this place. “Sunt au-
tem disputationes Bionis philosophi, quibus
stultitiam arguit vulgi, eui paene consen·
tiunt carmina Luciliana. Hic autem Bion,
qui Sophistes cognominatus est, in libro
quem edidit, mordacissimis salibus ea quae
apud poetas sunt, ita laceravit, ut ne Ho-
mero quidem parceret.” Some of his say-
ings are preserved in Diog .Laert. (iv. 7.
47 sqq.,) Cicero (Tnsc. Quaest. iii. 26), and
Seneca (de Tranq. An. viii. 2, xv. 3, de
Benef. vii. 7). Aqs‘ sal' is put for wit (S.
i. 10. 3), ‘sale nigro’ means eoarse wit, of
which the saying quoted by Cicero is a
specimen: “stultissimum regem (Agamem-
nonem) in luctu capillum sibi evellere,
quasi calvitio maeror levaretur.” If Lu-
cilius, as Acron says, imitated Bion, that
is, borrowed some of his course wit, Horace
probably was well acquainted with his say-

ings.
