OARMEN XII.

The Scholiast Acron, on Sat. i. 2. 64, has collected from Horace instances of fictitious
names put for real ones of the same number of syllables of the same quantity ; as Licinia
(so all the Scholiasta write the name) for Terentia3 Malthinus for Maecenas in the 25th
verse of the above Satire3 and Vellius for Annius in the 64th. Bentley quotes Persius
(Sat. i. 121) : “ Auriculas asini Mida rex habet? where Mida stands for Nero. He
. also quotes from Apuleius instances taken from Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, and Ticida,
whom Ovid mentions (Trist. ii. 433) in conjunction with other poets as disguising the
name of Metella under the fictitious one of Perilla. To these may be added Canidia,
substituted it would seem for Gratidia by Horace. Assuming, then, that Licymnia
represents Terentia (and not a mistress of Horace, as some commentators suppose, and
Acron inconsistently suggests as an alternation for Terentia), the date of the ode may
be conjectured. Maecenas was married to Terentia about ΛΑΜ). 721 or 722 (Epod.
iii.)‚ and she must have been in the prime of her beauty when this ode was written,
But the reference to Augustus' wars, especially in the verses “ductaque per vias Re-
gum colla minacium,” makes it almost certain that it was not written before his triumph
in the month Sextilis, A.U.c. 725. But the harmony between Maecenas and his wife was
not of long continuance: therefore it is probable the ode was written soon aster tho
triumph. That Augustus is called Caesar (v. 10) seems to Franke to make it probable
