Dum studet urbanus tenditque disertus haberi.
Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile, quodsi
Palle‘rem casu, biberent exsangue cuminum.

Ο imitatores, servum pecua, ut mihi saepe

Bilem, saepe jocum vestri movere tumultus! .

Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princepe,

Non aliena meo pressi pede.
Dux regit examen.

Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus

Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben.

Ac ne me foliis ideo brevioribus ornes

Quod timui mutare modos et carminis artem,
Temperat Archilochi Musam pede mascula Sappho,
Temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit quem versibus oblinat atris,

Nec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.

says he is not to be blamed for imitating
Archilochus in his measure and the struc-
ture of his verse, for Alcaeus and Sappho
did the same3 they tempered their Muse
with the measure of Archilochus. The

*iambica of Archilochus are imitated by

Horace ιιι the Epodes. Other measures of
Archilochus he has imitated in the Odoe.
Itis not so easy to see from the fragments
that remain of the ·three poeta wherein
Sappho and Alcaeus imitated Archilochus,
who wrote more than half a century before
them. There is little left of Archilochus
but his iambica. There is a greater va—

riety of metres in the fragments of the
other two; but how far the different mea-

sures were invented or modified by them
it is impossible to say. Alcaeus wrote
verses in what' is called the Sapphic metre,
and Sap pho in the Alcaic The style of
Sapphop s ents shows the reason why
Horace calls her ‘.mascula’ There' is a
vigour in the language and illustrations
which is beyond the ο power of
female passion, the delicacy of which ne-
vertheless is not lost in the boldness of the
expression. It is impossible not to see the
working of intense feeling in some even of
the shortest ents. (See C. ii. 13. 24
