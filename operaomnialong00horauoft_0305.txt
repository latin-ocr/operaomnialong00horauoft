GARMEN I.

A.u.c. 723.

Wm &aar Octavianus had determined on the expedition against M. Antonius and
Genu-hawhich led to the battle of Aetium, Luc. 723, he summoned, as we leam
stum Dion eunius (50. 11), the leading senators and men of &nesti-ian rank to meet him
ἠ Brundusium, for the benefit of their oounsel and (the historian says) to keep the
nquuffim from mischief, and also to show the world the harmony to which he had

. l. hught-eu of all orders at Rome. whatever the motives may have been, the suet

may be accepted. Maecenas obeyed this summons and went to Brundusium, but was

⁸ nunt back by Caesar ω watch over the peace of the city and the affairs of Italy, with

what particular powers, or under what title, history does not inform us, nor is the
quoefion material here. The Scholiasts (Acron and Comm. Cruq.) state that Maecenas
lud received the command of the fleet, or part of it as tribune, from Augustus. But
thee is no credit due to such statement& which are osten taken (as this may be), like
the inscriptions invented by grammarians, from incidental names and allusions in the
edm thelmelves. He appears ω have accompanied the expedition to Sicily against
Sextus Pompeius ΛΑΜ). 718, and the writer of the article ‘ Maecenas ’ in Smith’s
Dtet. Biog. thinks that this Epode was written on that- occasion. This opinion is quite
new, md 1 believe the general opinion to be correct. The language of affection in this

“ Epode ia too sumgfor the short acquaintance Horace had then enjoyed with Maecenas ς

also, there 'n evidence of the Sabine farm having come into Horace's possession when
he wrote it (v. 31). But that this did not occur till aster the publication of the first

book of Satires is certain, and it is generally referred to A.t·.c. 720. The opinion of ·

the name writer that Horace actually accompanied Maecenas ou this expedition to
Sicily is noticed elsewhere (C. iii. 4. 28 n.). It is very possible that Maecenas may
lave had the offer of a command in the expedition against Μ. Antonius, and that both
he and Horace believed he was going ou that service, until on his arrival at Brundusium
Augurum thought fit to send him back to discharge more important duties at Rom
Horace, suppossing him to be going ou this expedition, wished to accompany him, but
Maecenas would not allow it (v. 7), which gave occasion for this Epode.
