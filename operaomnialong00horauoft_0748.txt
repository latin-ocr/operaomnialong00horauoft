HORATII FLACCI

Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo ;
Semper ad eventum festinat et in medias res
Non secus ac notas auditorem rapit, et quae

Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit3

Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,
Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.
Tu quid ego et populus mecum desideret audi :
Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque

Sessuri donec cantor ‘ Vos plaudite ³ dicat,

Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores,
Mobilibusque decor naturis dandus et annis.
Reddere qui voces jam scit puer et pede certo
Signat humum, gestit paribus colludere, et iram

Colligit ac ponit temere, et mutatur in· horas.

ther to Tydeus. According to Homer he
was cursed by his mother Althaea for the
slaughter of her 'two brothers (Il. ix. 567

war, and had nothing to do with it, to be-
gin an account of Diomedes’ return with his
uncle’s death would be absurd.1t seems
as if some poet had been guilty of this ab·
surdity. The Scholiasts say it was Anti-
machus. (See v. 136 ιι .) [Welcker sup-

ses the ‘reditum, to be the return of
ffiomedes aster the expedition of the Epi-
goni against Thebcs.] ’

147. *qemino-ah ovo] That is, from the
birth of Helen, who was born from one of
the eggs brought forth by Leda, while Cas-
tor and Pollux issued stom the other. (S.
ii. 1. 26, “ovo prognatus eodem.”) This
introductory mat-ter was handled in the
poem of Stasinus before mentioued, of which
the following fragment has been preserved
in Athenaeus (viii. 3, p. 334) :—

τοις δὲ μετὰ τριτάτην Ἐλένην τέκε, θαῦμα
βροτοῖσι,

τήν ποτε καλλίκομος Νέμεσις φιλότητι
μιγεῖσα

Ζηνί, θεῶν βασιλῆι, τέκε κρατερῆς ὑπ’
ἀνάγκης.

148. in medias res] The ancients appear
particularly to have remarked this quality
of Homer's poemS. Quintil. vii. 10. 11:

‘ubi ab initiis incipiendum, ubi more Ho-
merico e mediis vel ultimis. ⁹”

151. Atque ita mentitur, sic veris]

‘xlta ‘so (’the oldest form of the neuter
pronoun ‘id ⁵), differs from‘ sit-,³ ‘so,’ as

the logical ‘i ’ or ‘ eo‚’ ‘ this: differs from
the demonstrative ‘ ho‚' ‘this’ '’ ‘ Ita’
therefore is the usual word with ‘ ut’ fol-
lowing. But the. poets (and sometimes even
the prose writers) use ‘sie' in the same
construction, and in others in which ‘ita’
is more usual. See Key’s L. G. 1451, and
compare C. i. 3. 1, “ Sic te Diva potens
Cypri ;” and Epp. i. 7. 69, “ Sic ignovisse
putato.”

[153. Tu quid] This isaddressed to any
person, who should think of writing a

189.1u the next verse ‘cantor’ is used
for the actor, as Cicero uses it (Pro Sest. c.
55). “Sedebat exanimatus: et is qui antea
cautorum convicio contiones celebrare suas
solebat cantorum ipsorum vocibus ejicieba-
tur. ” He is speaking of Clodius, at whom
as he sat in the theatre the actors pointed
some words from the comedy that was pobeing
performed. (See Forcellini. ) ‘Vos plau-
dite' were the words with which a play
usually concluded.
