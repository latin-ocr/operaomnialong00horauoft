GARMEN XVI.

'rhi- ode is written with great cure, and wus probably one of those compositions by
which Horace brought himselfinw public noticel It hm more the appearance of having
been written for fiune than any other in the book. Ι have no doubt it was written soon
η after Hence cume ω Rome at the outbresk of the Perusiam war, sanc. 713. Some
follow what they suppose to be the meaning of the Scholisst Acron, who says on the
- woed ‘Altera’ (v. 1) = “quando Antonius dimicavit contra Augustum? But he may
⁶ have referred to L. Antonius the mmuh st any rate the languago and sentimenta are
so different stom any that Horace used or was likely to use about the time of Actium,

unt the ode cannot be referred to that period. The state of Rome at the time sup-
* poseo numm very ἡνίαις by Appian (Bel. civ. v. 18—49) and Dion (xlviii. 9—15).
It hm been supposed that the notion of migrating to the fortunate islands, which many
of the comment-ton have taken too litet-any, was derived from the words of Sertorius,
recorded by Plutsrch in his life (e. 8), and said by the Scholinst Acron to have been
