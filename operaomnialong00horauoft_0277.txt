,ζέ the medium of statements made at a time when every one was ready to abuse the most
ν vii-tuom who were out of court favour. Lollius, as we have seen (C. iv. 2, Int.,) was

defeated Δ. U. ο. '788 by the Sigambri, but he retained his great influence with Augustae,

whom it was not easy, we may believe, to impone upon. At any rate, if he was hypo-
crite enough to deceive Augustus, Horace may be excused for assiguing to him excel-
lencies he did not possess. The date of the ode is not at all certain. The defeat of
Lollius, which caused a great deal of alarm at Rome, very probably raised many voices
against him, and gave an advantage to his enemies; audit is not improbable that

ἶ Horace wrote this ode to meet their attacks, and to console him under his defeat. The

confident ¹tone that runs through it brings the ode under the remark made in the

manducem to ode 6 of this book.

ARGUMENT.

³ Think not that my verses will die: though Homer stands first among poets, Pindar,

Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho‚—these all survive. Helen was
not the first woman that loved ς ιιοι· Ilium the only city that has been sacked 3 nor
the heroes of the Iliad all that have fought ς but the rest have been forgotten, be-

cause they have no poet to sing of them. Buried virtue is little better than buried ι

dulness. I will not therefore let thy labours pass unsung, Lollius, thy sagacity and
*uprightnesa thy mind free from avarice and secure from corruption. It is not the
ponesaor of richen that is wealthy, but the man who knows how 1ο use the gists of
Heaven and to endure poverty‚ who hares corruption, and is ready to lay down his
life for his country or his friends.
