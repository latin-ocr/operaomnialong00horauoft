ΟΑΒΜΕΝ XXIX.

‘that this ode was written A.U.c. 729 has been confidently assumed by Franke from
the allinions in vv. 25—28. It would be hard to show that the same namae might not
have been introduoed in the same way at other times, and I have not sufficient confi-
denoe in this date to adopt it. It is not clear, as stated before (C. iii. 8, Introduction),
that Maecenas had charge of the city or any specific responsibilities during Augustus'
numae in Spain, and there is nothing in the lang-uage of this ode to lead necessarily to

other private odes that are addressed to him. It is clear that he appreciated the sound
sense of Horace, and allowed him full scope for expressing it; which he has done in this

,oda in a manly and at the same time feeling way, with great poetical taste and an

admirable selection of words, of which there is not one thrown away or out of place. ”
It is an invitation from the poet to his patron, pressing him to pay him a visit at his
