164 HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN VIII.
A.U.c. 729 (Ρ).

This ode was composed on the anniversary of Horace's accident with the tree (C. ii.
13), andis supposed by Franke (p. 158 sqq.) to have been written ΔΑΜ). 729. His
argument is very long, and rests chiefly on the allusions in the fisth and sixth stanzas.
The Parthians were invaded that year by a Scythian army to restore Phraates (C. i. 26,
Introduction). In that year Augustus brought to an end his expedition against the
Cantabri (C. iv„ Introduction), and during his absence he assumes that Maecenas was
governor of the city, as he had been on former occasions (Tac. Anu. vi. 11, Dion. 51. c.
3). He places in that year the expedition of Lentulus against the tribes of the Danube
(C. ii. 9. 23), here represented by the Dacian king Cotison. ΤΙιε only authority on
that subject is Florus (iv. 12) and Suetonius (Octav. 63), who do not give any clue to
the date. The whole argument appears to be full of doubt. Lentulus’ was not the
only expedition against the northern tribes. No mention is any where made of Mae-
cenas being employed as here supposed on the occasion in question, nor does Horace
say he was or even imply it τ v. 17, “ Mitte civiles super urbe curas,” might have been
written to any public or thonghtful man in Rome on such an occasion. The quarrels
of the Parthians and the subJection of the Cantabri are the two points that have most
weight, and from those 1 should be inclined to adopt Franke's date (rather than others

> that have been proposed), which fixes those of ii. 13 3 ii. 17, and furnishes an approxi-

mation to that of i. 20, as the introductions to those odes will show. [Lachmann, fol-
lowed by Ritter, fixes the date of this ode in A.U.c. 725. An examination of all the
authorities which are quoted in support of this opinion will show that the conclusion is
not true. All that is proved is that the ode was not written before A.U.c. ¹725.]

ARGUMENT.

Wonderest thou, learned friend, what this sacrifice means on the Kalends of March, and
Ι a bachelor? On this day I was delivered from death, and it shall be a holiday.
Come, Maecenas, a hundred cups of my oldest wine to the health of thy friend. Away
with anxiety. The Dacian has fallen, the Mede is divided against himself, the Oan-
tabrian is in chains and the Scythian has unstrung his bow. Be here the private
gentleman; never mind the people; enjoy thyself and unbend.
