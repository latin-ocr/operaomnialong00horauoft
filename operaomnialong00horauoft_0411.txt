SATIBARUM Ῑ. 5. 375

SATIRE V.

In the year Amo. ‘714 aster the taking of Perusia by Caesar Octavianus, M.Antonius

Α · pel-red sor war, which was averted by an arrangement made through the mediation of
5, meeum on the part of Caesar, and of Cocceius and Pollio on the part of Antonius, and
,. hy ffiemrriage of Octavia, Caesar's sister, toAntonius. But that this was not the occasion
2 , of the journey recorded in this Satire is certain, because Horace was not introduced to
’ usnemu till the beginning of Aac. 716. 'l'he same objection, among several others,

Ῥ is flul to the theory which connects the journey with the spring of the year 716. At
ς that time M. Antonius arrived at Brundusium with his fleet at the request of Caesar,

the two rivals (Caesar being at Rome) through agents employed by both, but without

²- effect, till Octavia undertook to mediate between her husband and brother, and was

finally moeoesful· ιιι reconciling them. It has been supposed, with every probability,

-uubed by the gnata and srogs. That it was not summer is probable from the party
nquit-ing a fite at Trivicum (v. 80). Appian states expressly that Antonius arrived

umes started from Rome with only one companion, Heliodorus the rhetorician

„- (ν. Ζ), and they travelled together three days and one night, sixty-one Roman miles, till
j Μ reached Tarracina or Anxur, where by appointment they were to meet the official
’ mbas of their party. These were Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed
in negotiating the first reconciliation between caaear and Antonius, and Fonteius,
⁷ an intimate friend of Antonius. Three days afterwards they met at Sinuessa Horace' s
fiune most intimate friends, Plotius Τιιοαι, Varius, and Virgd3 one of whom, Varius,
“’ kept them company only for six days, and lest them, for reasons which are not men-
: fimes, at Canusium (v. 93). The rest of the party went on together till they reached

⁴, Brundusium, fisteen days aster Horace had left Rome. The route they took was not
thesbon-test or the easiest, which lay through Venusia and Tarentum. They preferred

“ taking.the road which strikes across the country from Beneventum, and, reaching the

cent at Barium, continues along the shore till it comos to Brundusium. They were
’ evidently not pressed sor time, and probably took the road they did because it passed

λ through Canusium, whither one of the party was bound. Maecenas made his journey

ι uagreeable as under the circumstances it could be, by taking with him such com-
* 5 panion„ and they all appear to great advantage in Horace' s good- humoured diary.
· 'lbere was no restraint between the patron and his friends, and their affection for him

 

and one another it ns very pleasant to contemplate.
