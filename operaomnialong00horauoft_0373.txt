2. Mendici] This word includae beggam
of all sorte, of whom a great variety ap-
peared as religione mendioents, priests for
instance of Isis or of Cybele (known by the
Greeks under the title οἰμητραγύρται) and
J ewS, who made gain of their law, invent-
ing chax-ms perhaps from it, and persuad-
ing the foolish to pnrchase phylacteries.
Juvenal mentium this class of beggam in
his sixth Satire (v. 543 ⁸q.): “Art-anam
J udaea hemena mendicat in aurem Inter-
prea legum Solymarum.'’ There were also
fortune-telleia all over the town. See C.
i. 11, Introd. Street musicians were as
common and aa discordant at Rome as

— mimae] The ar actors at Rome,
asin Greece were men 3 but the daucing and
pantomimic parts were sustained also by
women. Horace mentions one of this class
named Arbuscula (S. i. 10. 77), who was a
celebrated ‘mima’ in Cicero’s time (Ad
Att. iv. 15. 6, written Luc. 700): “quaeris
nunc deArbuscnla. Valde placuit. Ludi

, magnifici et grati.” They were persons

of loose character, as the woman Origo
mentioned below (v. 55), aud the before·
mentioned Arbuscula, and the woman
Cytheris, whom M. Antonius carried

about with him under the name of Volum- ,

nia (Cic. ad Att. x. 10 ; Phil. ii. 24).

— balatrones] The meaning and etymo-
logy of this word are hopelessly lost. Cru-
qnius’ Scholiast gives three different deriva-
tions 3 from Servilius Balatro (mentioned
S.ii. 8. 21), who, as Foreellini observes, more
probably got his name from the species
than the species from him ς ‘a balatu: from
an affected ridiculous way of speaking,
which is against prosody ; ‘ a blatiendo:
from their senseless babble3 and some he
says read ‘ barathrones: asfinm ‘barathrum’
because they were gluttonons livers who
devonrezl their substance, according to Ho-
race's expression “ barathrumque macelli*”
(Epp. i. 15. 31). It is not necessary to go
