OARMEN VII.
A.U.o. 724.

“ Ad Pompilium Varum scribit gaudens ob ejus in patriam reditum quem commilito-
nem in eastris Bruti et Cassii fuisse commemorat 3 et belli civilis evasisse pericula
Augusto victore? These are the words of Acron, and many of the MSS. have ‘AD
Ponmux’ or ‘Ponnmx Vama: the latter being correct. But Sanadon, fol-
lowedby nearlyall commentatore till the last few years, has consounded the person here
addremod with Pompeius Grosphus (C. ii. 16), who is also mentioned in Epp. i. 12. 22.
But the proscribed follower of Brutus cannot be identified with the wealthy Grosphus,
8⁵ nectebas observed3 and, as Vanderburg has remarked, the newly made citizen would
not have been addressed in the language here used: “ Quis te redonavit Quiritem Dis
patriis Italoque caelo.’' Masson (Vie d'Horaoe, p. 88 sq.) fixes the date iu A.U.c. 715,
in which year those of the republican party who had followed Sextus Pompeius were
allowed to return, peaoebeing made between Sextus and the triumvira, and an amnesty
being granted to his followers. Kirchner (Q. H. p. 5) strongly supports this opinion.
Dacier mks why then Horace should have used the words “ Quis te redonavit,'' αἱαὶ)
and though the words must not be taken too literally as a question, and are more an
“messioni ofjoyful surprise, yet there is something in the remark3 and moreover it is
pretty certain that Horace when he wrote was in possession of his country -house, and
had been in it some time (vv. 19, 20). But he did not get this house till after. the first
book of Satires was finished, that is not till A.U.c. 720, and it may have been a year or
two later. The long service of Pompeius (mentioned in v. 18) is inconsistent with the
above early date 3 and something may be said in respect to the style of the ode, which
'none of Horaoe’s best. Also it is doubtful, as it appears to me, whether even in jest
Horace would have alluded to Philippi in the way he here does, if he were writing soon
aster that memorable disaster. On the whole, it is most probable that Pompeius did
notmtnrn to Rome, as Acron intimates, till after the civil war was over, having mean-
while followed the fortunes first of his namesake Sextus, and then of M, Antonius, and
thot the ode was written ass-c. 724, or thereabouts.
