EPISTOLARUM I. 11.

607

Incolumi Rhodos et Mytilene pulchra facit quod
Paenula solstitio, campestre nivalibus auris,
Per brumam Tiberis, Sextili mense caminus.

Dum lieet ac vultum servat Fortuna benignum,

20

Romae laudetur Samos et Chios et Rhodos absens.
Tu quamcunque deus tibi fortunaverit horam
Grata sume manu, neu dulcia differ in annum,

Ut quocunque loco fueris vixisse libenter

Te dicas3 nam si ratio et ’prudentia curas,

25

Non locus effusi late maris arbiter aufert,
Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.
Strenua nos exercet inertia: navibus atque

Quadi-igis petimus bene vivere.

Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus.

17. Incolumi] See S. ii. 3. 137 ιι.

18. Paenula solstitio, campestre] The
⁸ paenula’ was a thick outer mantle worn
The‘ cam-

'was a linen cloth worn round the
oins in games or exercises in which the
body was otherwise stripped, as also in
swim The garmeni: which Adam
and Eve niade for themselves of fig· -leaves‚
which the Se ptuagint translators 0811

Augustinus (de Civ. Dei, xiv. 17) renders
“consuerunt folia fici et fe-

: id est succinctoria

cinctoria posuerunt. Porro autem cam-
pesti-ia latinum quidem verbum est, sed ex

eo dictum quod juvenes qui nudi exerce-
bantur in Campo pudenda operiebant:

[21. deese] ‘Absens’ which is con-
nected with ‘ Samos’ and the other places,
and opposed to ‘Romae‚’ means that a
man may praise these distant spots, if he
filnes, but he should stay at home. The

point of the ΕΡ istle is that happiness does
not depend on change of place. ]

8 place which commende (as we say) awide
prospect over the sea, such as Lebedus.
28. Strenua noe exercet inertia] This
is a very happy expression, and has become
proverbial for 8 ‹lo-nothing activity, such
exertions as tend to no point and produce
no fruita. [Seneea de brevit. vit. c. 11,
has‘ desidiosa occupatio,'Krs1ger.] ‘Na-
vibus atque quadrigis' obviously means
‘running about by sea and land? ‘Quad-
riga’ is any carriage drawn by fom- horsea
(abr-east, two under the yoke attached to
the pole, and two outside‚ ‘’funales fas-
tened by traces), though the word is more
generally used for a triumphal or racing
chariot than for 8 travelling carriage, of
which there were various kinds. ‘Rheda’
was the most general name for such a car-
riage on four wheels (S. ii. 6. 42 n.).
‘Petorritum’ was another name, and a
third was ‘‚'carruca a later name, not
known in Horace’ s time. Of travelling
carriages there was a variety of names:

30. Est Ulubris] mubrae was a smau'
town of Latium, not far from Velitrae, and

a place of no importance. Juvenal (x. 101)
