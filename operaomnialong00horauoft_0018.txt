’ xiv PREFACE.

allusions in modern writings become after a few years. Horace did-
a good deal to improve the Latin language, and he took the liberty,
which he defends, of saying many things in a new way. His
poetica] power was great and varied; and if he had possessed more
energy of character, he might have done even more than he has.
But what 116-1165 left is a proof of his talent. He gave the Romans,
as far as their language would permit, a set of lyrical compositions
both 111 matter and form not unworthy copies or imitations of the
Greek3 and though such imitation is a confession of inferiority and
sometimes is feeble and trifling‚ he still shows that he could infuse
the vigour of the Latin tongue into the measures of Sappho and
Alcaeus, and present to us a variety of natural and pleasing
images in language simple, concise, and expressive. A last careful
reading of Horace's lyric poems, after a long acquaintance with
them, has made me estimate them higher than I did, and even
when he is less successful, I feel more indulgence towards the poet
for daring so much and doing it so well.

Mr. Macleane has made some judicious remarks on Horace in his
Jiltroduction 3 and a recent writer in “ Blackwood’s Magazine ”
(No. DCXXX.)‚ “ On the Causes of Horace’s Popularity‚” has
written 611 instructive and agreeable essay.

But how do we know that we have what Horace wrote ⁴? A work
which has come down 10 115 from a very remote time 'by successive
transcriptions must contain many errors. Even books when they
have been often reprinted differ very much from the original. The
general consent of the manuscripts of Horace is the only evidence
of what he wrote; and it is a wonder that the diversities in the
text are not more than they are. But these diversities are sufficient
to prove that in many passages we cannot discover the true read-
ings, and we never shall. It is the business of the critic to use the
documentary evidence of the manuscripts, and to attempt to derive
from thevarious readings some probable conclusion. This branch
of the critical art requires great labour‚ judgment, and tastc, and we
are much indebted to scholars for what they have done towards
establishing the text of Horace and other ancient writers. I have
had neither timo nor inclination to do any thing· for Horace in this
