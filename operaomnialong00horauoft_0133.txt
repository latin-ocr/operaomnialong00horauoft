have been familiar with Tibur and Tarentum and other 1003111103 which he alludes ω. Τ110
allusion to theCantabri in v. 2 issupposed by others 10 fix the date much later, namely,
in sanc. ¹729, when Augustus was engaged in redueing a rebellion in Spain. At any time
before LII-0. 725, when the Cantabri were first reduced, they eould have been ealled by
Horaee ‘indoctos juga ferre nostra? even though no attempt had been made to impose
that yoke. In 725 they were reduced to subjection; in '728 they bmke out again, and 111
1110 following year they were finally subdued, though an uuimportant disturbance had 10
beput down by Agrippa some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21; iv. 14. 41. Epp. i. 12.
26). If therefore the ode was written after 725, 11 must have been in the beginning of
729 or thembonts, and I am inclined to think that was the date, though Ι admit the
difficulty of understanding why Horace should speak of himself even poetieally as tired
of wat-flue and the sea, so many years aster he had eeased to have any thing to do with
either. That he does not speak of his Sabine farm, but gives the preference to Tibur
or Tarentum, proves nothing. Long aster he had possession of his farm, 110 expresses
his preference for those places (Epp. i. 7. 44). ·—
—— “mihi' Jam non regia Roma,
Sed vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle Tarentum?

(See also C. iii. 4. 21 sqq.) That 110 frequented Tibur is well known. Some say he
owned‚ some he rented, a small property there. It may, however, bedoubted aster all,
perhaps, whether Hor-aee must be taken as speaking strictly of himself. He may only
mean, in effeet„ that the weary need seek no happier resting-plaee than Tibur or Taren-
tum, though he puts the matter in the form of a wish for himself. It was probably 011
or aster a visit to Septimius that Horaoe eomposed the twenty-eighth ode of the first
book ς and, probably with the atti-actions of Tarentum fmh in his mind, he wrote this
ode. But he may have paid his friend many visits.

ABGUMENT.

Septimius, whoart ready to go with me to the ends of the earth, 1 would that I might
end my days at Tibur, or, if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Above all others 1
love that spot, with its honey, its olives, its long spring, and mild winter, and grapes

lay my bones and weep over them.
