CARMINUM Ι. 4.

Nunc decet aut viridi nitidum caput impedire myrto

Aut flore terrae quem ferunt solutae.

Nune et in umbrosis Fauno decet immolare lueis,
Seu poscat agnam sive malit haedum.

Pallida Mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
Regumque turres. Ο beate Sesti,

Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam.

Jam te premet nox fabulaeque Manes

” favour of the latter. why should the
copyist: have changed ‘ visit' into ‘urit ?’
'l'he reverse would be iutelligible. That it
is said of Venus (C. 111. 28. 15), “Paphon
junctis visit oloribus? is no ment at
all. Ovid (Fast. iv. 4¹73) has “Antraque
cyclopum positis exusta caminia” which

ι11. lib-no decet immolare] The Fauna·
lit took place ou the Ides of December.
But a ἰαυοῖ festival was observed on the
121oe of February, at the advent of Faunus

(Pan. the two being, aa is well known,
identified the later Romans). See C.

· iii. 18. Ovi Pnstii. 193: “Idibusagrestis
fumat altaria Fauni.” At that time the
floeks and herda went out to grane, and
the god was invoked for their protection.
⁸ Immolare’ admits of two constructious:
with an ablative, aa (Livy xli. 18) “immo-
lantibus Jovi singulis bubus‚’' and wit-h an
amative, as (Virg. Aen. x. 519) “inferias

immolet umbris.” Horace himself

has the latter construction elsewhere (S. ii.

3. 164): “Immolet aequis hic porcum

Laribus?¹ SoVirgilOEcl. iii. 77), “flu-„iam

vitula-’³ Servius quotes this pamage as

lnving the ablative mse of the victim.
But it appears (according to Orelli, who
howeverhas ‘agna' and ‘haedo') that in
the tables of the Fratres Arvales the accu-
nave is used with ‘immolarel and the
ablative with ‘faceres andthe reason is
obvious: thelatter ia an elliptieal expres·
aion inwhich ‘sacrum’ is understoossas
Pe· marka. '1¹1ae MSS. vary. If the ac-
emtive be the true reading,as1believe
it ia, the ablative may have got into the
MSS. without any remarkable oversight;
‘aguam' would be written ‘agna’ and
haedom' (for ‘haedum ') would be written
hedo? These marka were frequently
omitted through haste or carelessness.

Ven. has ‘agnam’ and ‘aedos‚’ where it

seems probable that the MS. followed by
Isandinus had the mark ‘i' in the first
word, but omitted it in the second, aud that
the editor added the ‘s' to ‘haed03’ or
that this had been done by the copyist of
the MS. he followed. Most of the modern
editors have adopted the reading with the
ablative. Lambinus has the accusative,
which is approved by Rutgersius.

13. pulsai] Ovid, Heroid. xxi. 46,
“ Persephone nostras pulsat acerba fores.”

14. Reges] This word is commonly ap-
plied to the rich by Eorace (S. i. 2. 86),
and by Terence too, as Phormio (i. 2. 20) ε
“ Oh! regem me ωδε opertuit.” Sestius
was a favourite of Fortune, as a reference
to his life will show. ‘¹ Beatus dicitur qui
multa habens sine malo aliquo degit'' is
OEcero's definition. [Horace here uses
‘beatus' in the sense of rich, as in S. ii.
8.1; C.ii. 4135 iii. 7.3; iv.9. 46, &c-
Ritter.

16. ground] From this word, which be-
longs more properly to ‘ nox‚' we must
understand appropriate words for ‘Manes'
and ‘domum’ Orelli supplies ‘ circum-
volitabunt’ and ‘hegen’

fabulaeque Ham] This is explained
by Juv. S. ii. 149 :—
“ FASe aliquos Manes ·—
Nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere
lavantur.” ·

Horace may have had in mind the follow-
ing epigram of Callimachus :—

ὖ Χαρίδα, τί τὰ νέρθε ,· πολὺ σκότος’ αἱ δ’
ψεξδτοῗῨιὸτὲἑ Πλούτων,- μῦθος· ἀπωλόμεθα.

Persius has imitated Horace, S. v. 152 z
“ cinis et Manes et fabula fies? ‘ Fabulae ’
signifies ‘ unrealss Ptopert. ou
the contrary says (iv. 7. 1), “Sunt aliquid
Manen letum non omnia fini .”
is variously interpreted, eitheras ‘ bare? aa
it is in Epp. i. 6. 45: “Exilis domus eet
qua non et multa supersunt? or ‘shadow5,’
or ⁴ narrow,' meaning the grave, which is
called ‘ Leti domus? ‘ Ditis aeterna domus ’
