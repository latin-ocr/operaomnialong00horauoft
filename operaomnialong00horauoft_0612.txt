5 76 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE VI.

Who Numicius was nobody can tell, and it does not signify. Any other name would
have done as well. Nothing turns upon the character or circumstances of the person
nominally addressed, and I feel inclined to put the Epistle in the same light as several
of the Odes, in which, as 1 have often had occasion to remark, a name seems to be
introduced more to give life to the poem than for any other reason. The Numicia was
a patrician gens of no great note.

In respect to the time of composition, the only guide is v. 26: “Oum bene notum
Porticus Agrippae et via te conspexerit Appi,’' and that does not assist us much. (See
note.)

As to the design of the Epistle, it is to support virtue, under the aspect of a calm
self-content as the chief good. The ordinary standards of happiness are treated with
contempt, and there is a strong vein of irony running through the greater part of the
Epistle, as will be seen by the Argument.

ARGUMENT.

The only way to get happiness and to keep it, Numicius, is to save the mind from ex-
citement. There are wise men who can look calmly on the awful skies. What do
γοα suppose they think of the treasures of the earth and sea, and the rewards of a
paltry ambition P But he who fears their opposites is excited just as much as he who
desires these things themselves: each is taken by surprise, and in either case there
is uneasiness. Be it joy or grief, desire or fear, what is the difference if every thing
that falls out a little otherwise than is expected strikes a man dumb and makes him
stare like an idiot P N ay, he who seeks virtue herself in excess is mad though he be
wise, and a knave though he be good.

(v. 17.) Now then, go run after fine things3 delight yourself in the praises of a mob ς
rise early and sleep late, that the fellow Mutus may not be richer and therefore more
admired than γοα 3 but be sure that time brings obscurity to light and buries all
that is brilliant in the earth: after all your admiration you shall go whither greater
men have gone before γοα.

(v. 28.) If γοα are sick, γοα take physic. Yon want to be happy of course. Then if
virtue be the only means, be resolute, make every sacrifice, and follow her.

(v. 31.) If virtue be but a name, make haste to be rich: off with you before any one
gets the start: money is a queen, she will get γοα every thing. Persuasion and
Love are in her tsi-ain. Mind γοα are not like the poor king of Cappadocia. No,
look at Lucullus, who knew not how much ‘he had got: that is your only rich man ι
he had plenty for himself and the thieves too. So if money is to make you happy,
make that your first object and your last.

’(ν. 49.) But if you are for honours and show, why then get yourself a man to
prompt you : “ here comes so—and-so— shake hands with him—there's a man will get
you plenty of votes—here¹s another can give places to whom he will.” Be sure you
are civil to them ε make them father, brother, on the spot.

-ν, 56.) And if eating is your good, see, the day dawnS, be off to the max-ket, buy your
boar as Gargilius did, and pretended he had killed it himself. Let us go bathe with
*our bellies fun-no more fit to be citizens of Rome titan the swinish crew of
m sses.

(v. ὃέ.) But if life is nothing without love aud jest, then in love andjest let us live.

And so good bye. > If you know any better rules, let me know them too. If not, let
us both follow mine.
