101. salutandi plures] This does not
mean that he would have more acquaint-
ances, but that in order to preserve his
position he must sell his independence,
bowing ω persons he would not otherwise
notice, and paying visits of ceremony early
in the morning, ——a trouble that Horace
would feel more than most men. [He

or two persons to go about with him in
the- character of clients; he must buy a
number of horses and slaves of the lower
sort. ‘Calones ’ were properly slaves who
went with the army. But the word was
also applied to domestic slaves employed
on menial work. The ‘petorritum’ was
a four· wheeled oerriage. Gellius, who has
a chapter on the subject (xv. 30), affirms,
on the authority of Varro, that it was in-
troduced from Gaul beyond the Alps.
Festus says the name is derived from the
number of wheels, and the Welsh ‘ped-
war,' ‘four‚' and ‘riden‚’ ‘wheels,' make
the Celtic origin of the name not impro-
bable. (See Gronovins' note on the above
passage of Gellius) The Aeolio form
πίτυρες, and the Osean ‘pet-ur: ‘four,’
and the Latin ‘ rota‚’ show that the above
is not the only etymology of which ‘pe-
torritum' is capable. Comm. Cruq. on
Epp.ii.1. 192, says the‘ petorritum' was
used for the conveyance of female slavus
but there ιε no reason to suppose it was
limited to that us e. [‘ Peregre aut3’
