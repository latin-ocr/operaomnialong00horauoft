HORATII FLACCI

Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum 5 , ·
Fecunda vitis nec sterilem seges
Robiginem aut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus anno.
Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido

Devota quercus inter et ilices

'10

Aut crescit Albanis in herbis
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
Parvos coronantem marino 15

Rore deos fragilique myrt0.

χερῶν. As to ‘ nascente Luna’ see C. iii.
19. 9 n. The prose form of ‘hornus' is
‘hornotinus-⁵ The epithet ‘dulces’ may
have been copied from Lucretius (ii. 1160),
“ Ipsa dedit dulces fetus per pabula Iaeta.”
[Ritter maintains that the ‘alumni' are
newly-planted trees, named ‘ dulces' from
the fruit. See ‘ alumnis' C. iii. 18. 4.
Columella, iv. 27, speaks of the ‘ alumni‚’
shoots of a vine.]

[9. nivali] ‘ Snow·covered,' sometimes in
winter. Comp. ‘ Quodsi bruma nives Al-
banis illinet agris' Epp.i. 7. 10.]

10. Devota] In the oak woods of Mount
Algidus (in Latium) and the pastures of
Alba were fed swine and cattle, especially
for sacrifice. ‘ Securim’ (v. 12) is the read-
ing of some MSS. Bentley prefers the
singular for euphony, aad because ‘ vic-
tima’ is the singular number. Most per-
sons will decide in favour of ‘ secures,' and
‘ securim' would require ‘pontificis’ on
Bentley's showing.

[14. ‘ Tentare-deos: can only mean ‘ to
attempt to gain the favour of the gods.’
The ‘little gods' are the little images of
the Lares. (Comp. ii. 18. 27.) ‘ Ros ma-
rinns‚' or ‘ rosmarinum’ is the Greek λιβα-
νωτίς, Plin. H. N. 19. 62, quoted by
Ritter.

18. I]V'on sumptuosa blandior hostia] ‘If
the hand be innocent that touches the altar,
not with sumptuous victim more welcome
does it appense the angry Penates than with
picus meal and crackling salt? [But this
passage may be translated without suppos-
ing that ‘quam’ is omitted: ‘ not more
persuasive with sumptuous victim it ap-
peases the angry Penates with pious meal
and crackling salt.’] Bentley makes ‘hostia’
the nominative case, in which he follows
Porphyrion. Acron saw better, and Bent-

ley must have forgotten his note, when he
says, ⁶ uterque Scholiastes nominativi casus ⁴
esse monuerunt.’ The production of the
final ‘a' in ⁴ snmptuosa’ is not indefensi-
ble, but it is no defence to say, as Bentley
says, that Martial has (v. 69. 3), “Quid
gladium demens Romana stringis in ora ?”
for ‘str' is a very different' combination
from ‘ bl,’ and Horace would not have taken
this licence even with those letters. The
real defence has been given above (C. iii.
5. 17 n.). But we need not trouble our·
selves about the matter, for ‘hostia’ is no
doubt the ablativo case Bentley supposes
‘immunis’ to mean ‘empty,’ without an
offefing, in which he follows what Lambi-
nus partly approved. [Ritter ε .‘ quae mu-
nera non offert.'] It signifles ‘ pure‚' and it
does not occur elsewhere in this sense with-
out a genitive. In the sense Bentley snp-
poses it occurs twice in Horace (C. iv. 12.
23 ; Epp.i. 14.33). [PerhapsBentley's is the
true meaning] ‘ Mollibitx an older form
for ‘ molliet‚’ and one which Horace never
35:15 ¹235. Ἥοὲῑῖῗὲω 32352A251⁰³²3222125
adopted ‘mollivit,' from many of the besl
MSS„ which reading is noticed by Oru-
quius, and was contained in one of his
Blandinian MSS. There can be no doubt
it is right, for, besides other consideratione,
the aoristic perfect is wanted to nd
with ‘ tetigit? and it gives the best sense.
When Bentley however argues that if
Horace had written ‘mollibit’ some 'at
least of the grammat-iaus would have no· ἶ
ticed such an unusual form, he overlooks
Acron, whose note is, ¹‘ mollibit: placabit-'³ ’
[But there is MS. authority for ‘moui-
bit‚’ which Ritter has.] ”
20. Farre pio et saliente mica] This in
the salted meal-cake offered in sacrifico.
