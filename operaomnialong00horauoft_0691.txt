the 01181801 barda, to bave been inspired by the Alban Muse. But if the same rule
1810118 appliedtotheBomans as to the Greeks, whose oldest poets no doubt are
111811 beat, 111811 farewell to our 8811888. No doubt onr painting, our music, our
wnutling, are better than the Greeks’ !

(v. 84.) But if time acts on poetry as it does 011 wine, what number of years are required
to give it worth ? Shall one who has been dead a hundred years bc counted old or
nnw? He is old and good. Well, take away a mouth or a year from the hundred.
Stin 118 may be oounted old. 'rhen 1 accept this admission, and takeaway one by
one, like the hairs from the borse's tail‚ till at last he shall fall to the ground who
8811108188 1118111 by a scale of years, and only admires what death has consecrated.

(v. 50.) Ennius is a sage, 8011 110111, aud another Homer, in the eyes of our critics. Hc
08181 nothing now for his dreams and his metempsychosis. Is not Naevius in our
hands and in our memories Ρ Such sanctity does age give to poetry. Men 1118111118
about the merits of these old people. Pacuvius is called leur-neth Accius sublime,
Afraniae toga would fit Menander,; Plautus is rapid as Epicharmus 3 Caecilius beats
alliu severity3 Terence in dramatic skill. These we learn3 these we crowd the
the-tm to 888. 'rheae are the only poets from Livius downwards.

(v. 63.) 80018111088 1118 vulgar judgment is right, sometimes it is wrong. If it prefers
these writers to all others it erra ς if it admits that there is a good deal that is anti· .
quated, much that is 1181811, much 11181 18 slovenly 111 them, it is wise, and Ι agree
with it, and Jove appr-oves. Ι have no wish to see Livius and his poetry banished (1
member too well Orbilius and his cane) ; 11111 that any 008 should think them per·
fection is to me surprising. If a single word starts up here and there better than the
rest it carries off the whole. On the other hand Ι am indignant that any thing should
be found fault with, not because it is bad but because it is new, and that not indul-
gence but honour should be demanded for the old. If I express a doubt about 8 play
of Atta’s, all the- old men cry out against- -my impudenoe for venturing to find fault
with that which Aesopus and Roscius acted. But the real reason is that they con-
sider nothing can be right but what satisfies them, or they cannot bearto throw away
111 their age what they got by heart as boys. But 118 who praises the songs of the

ι Salii, which he understands no better than I do, does so not from love to them but

. out of envy to us. 1f Greece had always hated novelty as we do, what should we
lnve had that is old ’τ’ When she began to turn from war, and 10 degenerate with her
new fertones, she went from athletes to horses, from sculpture to painting, from
music to tngedy, like a spoilt child. But it was to be expected when peace and pros-
perity came ς every thing that delights is apt to pall.

(1.103.) Once at Rome weused to see 0180 rising early to expound the law to cliente, or
learning how to make money and to be thrifty. Now it is all⁴ changed, and every
body 18 for writiug poetry. I myself, when Ι declare I shall write no more, lie like a

Ι Parthian, and begin scribbling before sun-rise. No man undertakes to steer a ship
who knows not how ; 00118 administer medicines but physicians, or handle tools but
workmen ς and yet, learned or unlearned‚ we all write poetry. This little error how-
ever has its advantageS. The poet loves not money, fears not loss of property, cheats
not his partner or his ward, lives plainly; and though he is of 00 use in war, he is of
use at home, if you allow that small things may help the great. The poet forms the
lips and chastens the minds of the yonng; hc records great deeds, furnishes great
examples, consoles the poor and sick. Where would be our choirs but for the Muse Ρ
How should we pray to the gods ? The homely rustics of the olden time, aster har-
vest, used to gather themselves together and offer sacrifice to Tellus and Faunus and
their genius. Throngh them 1181118 10 1118 Fescinnine verse, which then was innocent
of offence, till the liberty was turned into lic-enee, and the law stepped 111 10 arrest it.
When Greece became our prisoner she enslaved her captors, and brought in among
