640 HORATII FLACCI ’

Zethi dissiluit, donec suspecta severo

Conticuit lyra.

Fraternis cessisse putatur

Moribus Amphion : tu cede potentis amici

Lenibus imperiis, quotiesque educet in agros 45
Aetolis onerata plagis jumenta canesque,

Surge et inhumanae senium depone Camenae,

Coenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta ς

Romanis sollemne viris opus, utile famae

Vitaeque et membris, praesertim cum valeas et 50
Vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum

Possis.

Adde virilia quod speciosius arma

Non est qui tractet: scis quo clamore coronae

Proelia sustineas campestria ς denique saevam

Militiam puer et Cantabrica bella tulisti 55
Sub duce qui templis Parthorum signa refigit

Nunc, et si quid abest Italis adjudicat armis.

Ac, ne te retrahas et inexcusabilis absis,

different in their dispositionS, the one
being given to music, and the other to
country pursuits. Euripides and Pacuvius
each wrote a play called Antiope, the for-
mer of which is referred to by Plato
(Gorgias, p. 485) in connexion with a dis-
pute of these brothers. Zethus it appears
had a contempt for Amphion's lyre, and
advised· him roughly to throw it away, and
take to arms, and to useful pursuits, like
hisown. Cicero alludes to Pacuvius’ play
(de Orat. ii. 37) : “ Miror cur philosophiae
sicut Zethus ille Pacuvianus prope bellum
indixeris-'³ Propertius conti-asts the bro-
thers as “ durum Zethum et lacrimis Am-
phiona mollem '' (iii. 15. 31) ; and the
Scholiast on Hesiod (Theogonia 60) sayS,
Ἀμφίων καὶ Ζῆθος ἀδελφοὶ μὲν ἦσαν, ἑτερό-
ζηλοι δὲ ’γε-γόνασι ταῖς πρυαίρεσι. See the
fragments of Euripides' play in Dindorf's
collection (Poet. Sc. Gr. p. 82 sqq.) for
further notices of these brothers.

45. Aetolis onera-ta playis] See Epp.
i. 6. 58. Aetolian toils are toils fit for
Meleager, the king off Aetolia, and the
destroyer of the Calydonian boar3 of whom,
just returned from the hunt, there is a
picture in the Museo Borbonico, discovered
at Pompeii in the house that bears the
name of Meleager. With ‘ senium ' com-
pare ‘ senectus' (Epod. xiii. 5). [Kriiger

has ‘Aeoliis,' a conjecture, Ι suppose, of

which he gives a very forced explanation]
48. pulmenta laboribus empta] Compare
S. ii. 2. 20: “tu pulmentaria quaere Su-

dando.” ‘Pulmentum’ originally signi-
fied any thing eaten with ‘ puls‚’ porridge
or gruel (a common dish with the early
Romans) to give it a flavour. It came
afterwards to signify any savoury dish. κ
54. Proelia sustineas campestria] Com-
pare A. P. 379: “Ludere qui nescit cam-
pestribus abstinet armis.” The allusion
of course is to the games on the Campus
Martius [and the crowd of spectatore,
‘ corona’ .
’ 55. Οαὲιιαόνὶοα bella] See Introduction,
and C. ii. 6, Int.; iii. 6, Int. 3 iii. 8. As
to ‘Parthorum signa’ see Ep. 12. 2'7.
The following line is merely a flourish of
flattery like this about the standards. Au-
gustus had no intention of extending the
Roman empire at this time, and had no
occasion to do so if the Parthians were
humbled‚ which they were not. No further
conquest was attempted till ΔΑΜ). 739,
when some of the Alpine tribes were
beaten by Drusus and Tiberius, and their
country made into a province. (See C.
iv. 4, Int.) The great majority of MSS.
have ‘refigit’ (v. 56). But all the old
editions till Cruquius had ‘refixit,' which
is also supported by MS. authority. Bentley
defends ‘refigit,’ and it appears in most
modern texts. The present tense is relied
upon for fixing the date of the Epistle.
See Introduction.

58. Aa, ne te retrahas] Horace adds ”

another reason why he should not refuso
to join the amusements of his patron, that
