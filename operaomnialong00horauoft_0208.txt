17. Cerberus, quamvis] Many German
scholars (Orelli names ten, among whom is
Buttmann) have rejected this stanza as
spurious, the description being considered
tame, and the second verse in particular
unworthy of Horace. This way of arguing
overthrows all authority, and makes genu-

Allow that the stanza is none of the best,
I do not think the ode itself equal to many
others. Certainly more than one verse is
prosaic and feeble,judged by Horace’s usual
standard, and the length of the ode on such
a subject seems to me a defect, though the
scene at the end is pleasing.

Bentley would mend ‘ejus atque‚' which
especially offends him, and is indeed not
very harmonicus or strong, by inventing
‘exeatque‚’ which some may think better
and others worse ; and, although
