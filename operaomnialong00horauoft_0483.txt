SATIRARUM 11. 2. ’ 44⁷ ‘

contemnent, is a pleasant picture, and helps by contrast to illustrate the gluttonous and
luxurious habits ofthe city, which, though they had not yet reached the height they came
to underthctraining of Apicius (“qui in ea urbe, ex qua aliquando philosophi velut cor-
ruptores juventutis abire jus'si sunt, scientiam popinae pmfaems disciplina sua seculum
infccst? een. cons. ad Helv. 10), were already very bad. As political activity grew
dnngsmm and dimiuished‚ and wealth poured into the city, sensual indulgence grew
npiffly. Diuing began at what we should consider an early hom-3 and the rich passed
mna of their evenings over the table, which was furnished with delicscies and ornaments
at mineus expense. , The art of cooking must have been brought to great perfectiori
in the course of that period during which eating and drinking was the chief feature ἰα
aBoman’s day ς but Horace probably ‘only saw it in its infancy. Juvenal and Martial

Κ ammom full on this matter. Flesh, fisb, and fowl, and made dishes of every kind,

were imparted from all quarters. The art of digestion was as much studied as the art
of the kitchen, but diseases of course multiplied. Convivial amusements were neces·
sarily invented to beguile these long meals3 the science of conversation nom-ishad, and
small talk was a trade, professional dinem-out (‘ parasiti ’) being required ιο keep the
company alive whenever their own resources failed. This deflection from the simplicity
of tho early days of Rome is a melancholy feature in the history of the Empire3 but

v* “ it required perhaps a stronger and sterner pen than Horace’s to treat it thoroughly.

'Ulia Satira, the fourth, and the eighth, throw some light on culinary details; but the
vics of gluttony, which must have gone considerable lengths even at this time, might

bve been more vigorously attacked. It forms no part of the corruptions pointed out

⁷ , foereformation in the odes. Horace himself, though abstemious in his own appetite,

 

dinod ι good deal with the rich, and may not have thought it expedient or gracious to
att-ck them on such a point.

AR GQENT.

'l'he value of amoderate fare come learn from me (on the authority of the plain sensible
Ofella), not with the glitter of plate in your eye& but now, before you have broken
your fast. He who would judge truly must have an uubiassed judgment.

, (v. 9.) Go, get up your appetite with hunting or hall-play or the quoit, and then see
whether you will despise humble fare and reject the drink that is not mingled with
Hymettinn honey. If the butler is abroad aud no fish is to be had, your belly will
be content with dry bread and salt. How is this Ρ thy the pleasure of eating does
not lie in the savour of the meat, but in yourself. Let labour supply you with sance.
The most tempting daintiae give no pleasure to the bloated stomach. Yet scat-ce any
argument will prevent your preferring a peacock to a barn-door fowl, merely because

η it has a fine tan, and costs more money. How can γοα tell where that fish was
caught? You delight in a mullet of three pounds weight, and yet you must cut it
into fragments to serve it to your friends. But why then don't you like the big
lupus? Why, because the one is big by nature, the other small, and you like what is
unnatural and rare. The hungry belly, on the other hand, seldom despises a thing
because it is common. “I like to see a huge beast stretched out on a huge dishss’
says the glutton. Blow south winds and rot their dainties! But let them alone, they
are as good as rotten already for appetitos that want rather stimulants than food.
But these luxuries are only of late growth, and some day we shall have mast gulls in
fnshion.

(v. 53.) But moderatiori is not meanness, and it is of no use to avoid one fault only to
fall into another. Avidieuus puts old fruit and sour wine before his friends, and is
stingy of his stinking oil, even on holidays. Which would you rather imitate Ρ
Bespectability lies in a middle course, avoiding excessivo sta-ictness, but equally

ν avoiding a slovenly carelessness.
