Per quas Latinum nomen et Italae
Crevere vires famaque et imperi

Por-recta majestas ad ortus

Solis ab Hesperio cubili.
Custode rerum Caesare non furor
Civilis aut vis exiget otium,

Non ira quae procudit enses

Et miseras inimicat urbes.

Non qui profundum Danubium bibunt
Edicta rumpent J ulia, non Getae,
Non Seres infidive Persae,
Non Tanain prope flumen orti.

, Nosque et profestis lucibus et sacris

Inter jocosi munera Liberi
Cum prole matronisque nostris,
Rite deos prius apprecati‚

Some ΗΒΕ. have ‘ortus‚’ and others
⁴tartum? That the question cannot be
dudd& by the repetition of the final ‘s’
my be seen by any one who examines
Ennoea style carefully. The arguments
on the other side have not much more
'eight than this, which is Bentley’s‚ and
it ‘u always better to acknowledge the un-
certainty of a reading than to retine upon
it one way or the other. This is what
Dillmbr. has done, Ι think, in this and
'nome other instanees, though his edition
appears to me in the main as judicious as
⁸115 that has been published. [Ritter has
agoodnote on ‘ortus ι’ ‘numerus multi-
tudmis vi concreta praeditus loca et terras
ubi sol oritur indicat.']

[15. mqq'estas] ‘Majestas’ is magni-
tude, but particularly the dignity of a
puple, or a prinoe. In some Roman trea-
ties the expression ‘majestas populi Ro-
mam' was inserted. ‘Minuere majestatem,’
‘to-impair this dignity,’ was an offeuce
ηἲῗῧξιῖξηωσίυἰῑίε ngt vis] ‘Civilis’ be-
lqngsto ‘furora’ and ‘ vis,’ which is a tech-
mcal word, means here ‘personal violence?
‘Ira' applies to foreign quai-tels· See C.
m. 14. 14 n. ‘Inimico’ is a word which
Horace probably found in use by writers of
aformer day. Later writers have taken it
from hun. ‘Inimicat' means ‘sets at en-
mity? ‘Apprecati’ (v. 28), ‘remixto’ (v.
30), are also words first found in Horace.

1.8. πιθα] The MSS. and editors here
agn-m are divided between ‘eximet’ and
‘engen' Inter editors prefer the latter,

and it appears to me more forcible and
appropriate. (C. iii. 14. 14 n.) [Horace
has ‘exigere' in a different sense C. iii.
30.1. Ritterand Keller-have ‘eximet' hera]

21. qai profundum Danubium bibunt]
The German tribes, particularly the Vinde-
lici lately subdued. ‘Edicta Julia’ can
only mean here the laws of Augustus laid
upon them at their conquest, though in
the technical sense the word ‘edicta' would
not apply. The rules which a governor
published in his province were his ‘edic-
tum? but these people were not in a pro-
vince. Horace therefore does not use the
word in its legal sense (see Mr. Long’s
Exc. on the ‘ Edicta Magist.' Cic. Verrinae
orationes). The Getae lay towards the
mouths of the Danube, while the Daci
were sitnated to the west of them, on the
same or north side of the river.

23. Seres— Tana'in] See C. iii. 29. 27 n.
The Seroe and Indi are not much dis-
tinguished by Horace (C. i. 12. 56), and,
when he is referring to the East, their
names are generally associated with the
Parthians, more for the sake of amplifica-
tion than with historical or geographical
accuracy. The Roman armies had not yet
crossed the lower Tigris. But when Au-
gustus was in Syria, we are informed by
Suetonius, ambassadors came from the far
East to ask his protection and alliance.

25. lucibus] This word is 'used for
‘ diebus ' by Ovid. (Fast. iii. 397) :—

“ His etiam conjux apicati cincta Dialis
Lucibus imperas debet habere comm?
The singular is more common.
