SATIRARUM Ι. 3.

Nec vincet ratio hoc, tantundem ut peccet idemque 1 15
Qui teneros caules aliem· fregerit horti

Et qm· nocturnus sacra divum legerit.

Ne scutica dignum horribih' sectere flagello.

115. Nec vincet ratio hoc] ‘Nor will
any reesoniug prove this.' ‘Vincere cau·
nm' is ιιιῡ expression for winning

ιαιιιιο. ‘'Idem is explained by‘ tantun-

laws (Plnt. Solon, c. 17). ‘Qui sacra le·
gerit’ is ιι ‘sacril egns‚’ a stealerof‘ sacru?

religion.
119.1]Ve sontica d tynum] The epithet
‘horribili’ belongs to ‘ flagello‚' which was
a severe!- instrument than the ‘scutica‚'
find was sometimes constructed with hor-
rible cruelty, and fatal in its application
(S. i. 2. 41, and Epod. iv. 11). The ‘scu-
tica’ had one thong, of leather. ‘'Ferula
wss a switch usually from the vine. The
Latin derivativas from σκῦτος are short ιιι
ι1ιο first syllable, and some have supposed
the existence of a σκότος with the υ short.
But this’ is doubtful. There ure other in-

120. utserulacaedas] The rule' ιιι re-
spect to verbs of fem-ing· is that‘ ‘the Latin
inserts a negative where the English has
nome, mdvice νει-ω’ '(Key's L. G. 1186
note), i. e. ‘vereor ne’ means ‘I sear it

⁷ instrument of punishment. Juv. S. i. 15,
’ Martiul x. 62.]p

122. Barea latrociniis] This is not
strictly a technical distinction, nor is ‘ la-
trocinium’ a technical term. All robbery

was ‘furnum' whether attended with vio-
lence or not3 bnt Horace means to distin·
guish between thests without violence and
robbery with violence (⁸rspins ⁷). See
articles ‘furtum’ and ‘bona rupta’ in
Smith's Dict. Ant. Cicero distinguishes

‘furtum ’ from ⁸ rapina ’ (in Verr. ii. 5. 13).

- [·Μαφιὶε parva ⁹] Tbese words come
together because t und small are con·
trusted. The dative ‘ magnis ’ depends on

simili, ' but it is a carelaes way of writing,

for the man means to say that he will

125. et est rex] This notion of the
Stoics is expressed again Epp. i. 1.10'7.
Plutarch alludes to it in his treatise περὶ
Εὐθυμίας,0. 12. ἀλλ’ ἔνιοι τοὺς μὲν Στωῖ-
κοὺς οἴονται παίζειν ὅταν ἀκούσωσι τὸν
σοφὸν παρ’ αὐτοῖς μὴ μόνον φρόνιμον καὶ
δίκαιον καὶ ἀνδρεῖον ἀλλὰ καὶ ῥήτορα καὶ
πραττγγὸν καὶ ποιητὴν καὶ πλούσιον καὶ
βασιλέα προσαγορευόμενον, αὐτοὺς δὲ πάν·
των ἀξιοῦσι τούτων, κᾶν μὴ τυγχάνωσιν
ἀνιῶνται. The absurdity of the doctrine,
if such it may be called (it has no founda-
tion' ιιι the reported opinions of Zeno, Cle-
anthes, or Chrysippus, being the invention
of their followers), oemists, not so much in
the statement that the wise man's intelli-
gence contains in itself the germ of all
practical knowled g,e and that such know-
lcdge is power, as in the limitation of wis-
dom to the pale of a sect, and the attempt
to give a practical application to a notion
of this kind. The later Stoice looked to
Chrysippus as the founda- of their philo-
sophy; ·but he adhered, with little essential
deviation, to the doctrines taught him by
his master Cleanthes, and Cleanthes was ιι
devoted disciple of Zeno. ‘In quit' means
that some Stoic says this, including from

‘non nosti’ to ‘est sapiens? and aster
‘qui ΞΡ to‘ sic rex’ (v. 133), What he
