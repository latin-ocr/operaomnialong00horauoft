HORATII FLACCI

Multaque de magna superessent fercula coena,

Quae procul exstructis inerant hesterna canistris.

Ergo ubi purpurea porrectum in veste locavit
Agrestem, veluti succinctus cursitat hospes
Continuatque dapes nec non verniliter ipsis
Fungitur officiis, praelambens omne quod affert.

Ille cubans gaudet mutata sorte bonisque

110

Rebus agit laetum convivam, cum subito ingens
Valvarum strepitus lectis excussit utrumque.
Currere per totum pavidi conclave, magisque
Exanimes trepidare simul domus alta Molossis

Personuit canibus.

Tum rusticus: ‘ Haud mihi vita

Est opus hac,’ ait, ‘ et valeas ς me silva cavusque

Tutus ab insidiis tenui solabitur ervo.

dere,' and the flaming drapery of the
conch is described by the same word,
which is not applied in this sense else-
where. ‘Fercula’ was the name for the
different courses, of which the ‘coena'
usually consisted of three, called ‘prima,’
‘ secunda‚’ ‘ tertia coena! The word, like
‘ feretrum‚' contains the root ‘fer' of
⁴ fero,' and so its first meaning may have
been the tray or dish on which the viands
were brought. It seems here to mean the
viands themselves 3 ‘many courses were
left’ would mean nothing. ‘ Procul' sig-
nifies ‘ hard by,' as in Epp. i. 7. 32. The
rcmains of the evening’s ‘ coena’ had been
collected and put into baskets and left in
the ‘ triclinium' till the morning, and the
purple coverings were still exposed wait-
ing till the servants should cover them
S. 4. 84 n. .

( 107. velu)ti succinctus] ‘ Like one tucked
up' as the slaves when on duty. (S. i. 5.
5 n.) The dutiae of the ‘structor' are
those the host is here represented as per-
forming. It was his province to arrange
the dishes and see that they were properly
served up. He runs about, puts one course
after another on the table (‘ continuatque
dupes'), and tastes the dishes to see if
they are properly seasoned. ‘praegusta-
tores’ were regularly employed only at
the tables of the emperors Halotus, a
eunuch, is mentioned as serving the em-
peror Claudius in this capacity, and as
having been, according to some reports,
the agent of his death. (sueton. Claud.

44; Tac. Ann. xii. 66.) Lipsius on the
latter place says that the practice was
begnn by Augustus, and the title ‘prae-
gustator, a potione‚’ occurs in inscrip-
tions. The custom was imitated from
Eastern courts. (See Xenoph. Cyrop. i.

[1)11. agit laetum convivam] ‘ Plays
the merry guest? The Romans applied
the word to express acting a part. But
the mouse was really enjoying himselfl]

112. Valvarum strepitus] The servants
coming in early to clean the room inter-
rupt the banqueters and ronse the watch-
dogs, whose bai-king terrifies them still
more. The distinction between ‘valvae'
and ‘fores,’ that the latter opened out-
wards, ‘foras,' and the others inwards,
has been disproved by Becker (Gall. Sc. ii.
Ex. 1 . There was a dog, or more than
one, cpt in most houses, in the ‘cella
ostiarii: the porter's chamber at the side
of the ‘ostium.’ At the entrance of the
house at Pompeii, which has received the
name of the Trugic Poet's House, there
was discovered worked in mosaic on the
pavement a large dog, black and white,
with a red collar, with fierce aspect, and
as if ready to spring upon the person who
entered. Beneath it are the words “Cave
Canem.” Such dogs were occasionally
painted on the wall, as Petronius relates.
‘Conclave’ is the general term for any
chamber or suite of chambers under one
lock or bolt. As to Molossis see Epod.
