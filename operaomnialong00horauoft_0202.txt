the site of the ancient Leptis in Africa.
Juvenal (S. v. 34) speaks of wine

“ —cuj us patriam titulumque senectus
Delevit multa veteris fuligine testae?

13. amici Sospitis] This is a Greek
construction, which occurs again in C. iii.
19. 9, 10. See Theoc. xiv. 18:

ἔδοξ’ ἐπιχεῖσθαι ἄκρατον
ὧτιιζος ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος· ἔδει μόνον &rivos
ειπην.

 

Horace's request may amount to this, ‘pray
that my life may be prolonged a hundred
years 3' according to that of Ovid (Fast.
iii. 531 sqq.) :—

“ Sole tamen vinoque calent, annosque pre-
Qsciiznsttlimunt cyathos ad numerumque
Invdiiiiisnillic qui Nestoris ebibat annos,
Quae sit per calices facta Sibylla suos.''

14. viyiles lucernas Perfer] The pre-
ponderance of authority is in favour of
‘plerferff 1801110 MSS. 11111.ιέε ptrofen’f ‘For-
23592’11‘3e2531ff‘2 ⁸3²5? 55.;Sg.?q.1353.
from Cicero (de Pin. iii. 22. 76), “ beatam
vitam usque ad illum a Cyro exstructum
rogum p1·otulisset,'' which is precisely the
same3 but Orelli says ‘ pertulisset ’ is the
proper reading, and so Ernesti has it, but
says the other would do. It is impossible
to decide the question upon its merits, and
the MSS. are not safe guides in such a
matter. The abhreviations for ‘per’ and
‘pro ' are nearly the same, as observed by
Mr. Long on Cic. Divin. in Q. Caecil. c. 12.
The objection taken to ‘ profer’ is that ‘ in
lucem proferre' means ⁴ to bring to light)

But in this place there could be no confu-
sion. 111 C. iii. 21. 23 we have “ vivaeque
producent 1ueernae,” where ‘vivae' cor-
responds to ‘ vigiles ’ here. virgil uses
‘ ferre' uncompounded in Aen. ix. 338:
“ Aequasset noeti ludum in lucemque
tulisset?

17. Mitte civiles] See Introduction re·
specting the historical allusions.

19. sibi] This word is so placed that it
may depend 011 ‘infestus,’ ‘luctuosis‚’ or
‘ dissidet.' Ι prefer the first. Bentley with
little authority makes these adjectives
change cases.

22. catena] See above (C. ii. 13. 18 11.).

23. Scythae] Franks supposes these to
be the Scythians who had helped Phraates.
Orelli and Dillenbr. imagine them to be the

Geloni and other trans-Danubian tribes. 1⁷

believe Horace meant no more than gene-
rally to say that the enemies of Rome were
no longer disturbing her.

26. Pwrceprivatus] This I take to mean
no more than I have expressed in the Argu-
ment, not “ cum sis privatus? as Orelli
says, referring to Maecenas’ refusal to ac-
cept senatorial rank (C. i. 23. 5 n.). Bent-
ley opposes ‘ privatus’ to ‘ populus,' and
explains ‘since you have no cause to be
anxious about public affairs, do not be too
anxious about your own,’ and this may be
the meaning. I am not certain of my own
interpretation, but Ι feel sure Orelli’s is
wrong. In the next verse there is a contest
in the editions and MSS. between ⁴ cape’
and ⁴rape.’ Bentley defends the former,
because it is not usual to snatch a gist, but
only to take it quietly. His arguments will
not often bear being translated into Eng-
lish. [Keller and Ritter have ‘ cape,’ which
has the better authority. Also they have
