4. chy-rippa et audere] As to Chry
aippus the Stoic, see S. i. 8. 125 n. Both

town Soli. Crantor studied philosophy in
the Academia under Xenocrates and with
ΡοΙοιιιο. ms wri tmgs,according to Diog.
Inert. (iv. 24), amounted εἷς μυριάδας
στιχὸν τρεῖς, aomo linos. Cicero ranks
ongthe first of the Platonists
(Tuae-mmsp. iii. 6. 12), andspeakswith
particular commendation of a short treatise
of his, ‘de Luetu? The earliest editions
have ‘ plan-ius ac melius‚' and Acron, inhis
«numentary, has ‘manifestius et melius ;’
Porphyrion ‘melius et aptius,' which 1 take
to be‘ apertius? lf so, both thoee Scho-
liasta confirm the reading‘ planius? The
Blandinian MSS. had‘ plenius? so have
most of the Parisian‚ butp the okiaet of all
‘planius‚' and three others. The
St. Gallen and Berne have the latter, and
five of Fea' s Vaticana, with many others
quotedby Lambinus, Torrentius, Cruquffis,
planius' aster
it had been banished more thau a century.

1 find ‘ plenius' in the Venetian edition of
1549. 1 think ‘ planius' suits the context
better. Chrysippus is said by Diog. Laert.
(vii. 180) to have written more than 705
volumes: so that ‘ plenius’ would be rather
out of place, though obbas-ius, who retains
it, supposes Horace to mean that there
was more instruction in Homer than in all
the volumes of Chrysippus put together,
but he also means it is more clearly
convey ed. (See Introduction.) [‘ Detinet?
Ritoer follows the codices mauduni, which
have‘ distinet. ']

¹7. Bao-bariae] 'nnat is, Phrygia. [¹ Bar-
baria’ is a general name for all countries
not Greek] (See Epod. ix. 6.) ‘Aestus '
is a metaphor from the ebbing and flowing
of the tide, and represents the passions
and variableness of the princes and people.

9. Antenor emet] At a meeting of the
'l‘rojan chiefs aster the combat of Hector
and Ajax, Antenor pro to restore
Helen to the Greeks. which Paris flatly
refusae, ἀντικρὺ δ’ ἀπόφημι, ’γυναῖκα μὲν
οὐκ &romam (11. vii. 362 sqq.).

i. 7. 11 ιι.

13. Hune amor] From its position

‘huuc ’ seems to belong to ‘ Atriden? Time
allusion is to Nestoi-'s attempt to mediate
between Agamemnon and Achilles, when
the former angrily consents to restore
Chryseis, whom he loved above Clyt-em
