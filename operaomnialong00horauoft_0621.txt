EPISTLE VH.

On some occasion Horace having gone into the country for change of air on account
of his heslth, at the beginning of August. was tempted to stay away the whole month;
anda· he had promised Maecenas to return in a few days, he had perhaps received a
letter from his friend reminding him of that promise, and beggiug him ιο come back.
Maecenas was a valetudinarian, and had probably some of the quei-ulcus selfishness
that usually attends on that condition. We may infer as much from that ode (ii. 1¹7),
which begins ‘'‘ Cur me querelis exanimas tuis ?'' and he very likely felt the want of
Horace’s society at this time. We can only gather the tone of his letter or message
from tha character of Horace’s reply. He says he has no mind to risk a return of his
sickna- hy going back during the autumn to Rome3 indeed that he meant to be
absent at some warm place on the coast through the winter; that he was no longer
aa young and cheerful as he had been3 that he was sure Maecenas' liberality was

bestowed upon him in a generous spirit, and that he did not mean to compromise his
’ independence5 for if he could suppose such was the case, he would give up every
thing he had ever received rather than forfeit his liberty. He illustrates his position
by two stories,-one that of the fox who got into a vessel of corn and grew so sat
there that he could not get out again (which Horace was determined to prove was not
his cue), and the other a splenetic trick played by 1.. Philippus upon a worthy man
whom he seduced into leaving his home and vocation and settling on a farm in the
country, the result of which unnatural change was the total destruction of his peace
and independence. Το this too Horace means to say he will never let himself be
brought.

'l'hm is nothing disrespectful or angry in the Ephztle, though it might' appear from
ahare outline like the above, or from a superficial reading, that there was. lt was'
written aster many years of intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the influeuce Horace
had nequii-ed with his patron ς for though Horace was not perhaps of a servile dis-
position, as servility was then reckoned‚ he would not have assumed this tone if he
had not been sure Maecenas would not take offence at it.

There is no evidence to prove when this Epistle was written. It is generally attri-
buted to the same year as Epp. 15, when Horace was meditating a winter resideuce on
the const. But the date of that Epistle is also quite uncertain, and Horace in all pro-
bability passed most of his winters elsewhere than at Rome.

you let me go because I was sick, and now you will excuse me, 1 know, if 1 am

guest, and when he still politely declined‚ concluded with “ as you plesse: if you do
not eat them the piga will.'’ The spendthrifl: gives away what he does not care
son—a generosity that does but breed ingratitudo. The good man gives to those
who deserve, but he knows the valne of what he gives. 1 then will try and be
