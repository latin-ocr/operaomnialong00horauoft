 

SATIRARUM H. 3.

489

Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris ab imo
Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis, et idem

Corpore majorem rides Turbonis in armis

310

Spiritum et incessum: qui ridiculus minus illo?

, An quodcunque facit Maecenas te quoque verum est
Tantum dissimilem et tanto certare minorem ⁸?
Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis,

Unus ubi effugit, matri denarrat ut ingens
Illa rogare ε

Belua cognatos eliserit.

315

Quantane ⁸? num tantum, sufflans se, magna fuisset ⁸?

Major dimidio.

Num tanto ἲ Cum magis atque

Se magis inflaret, Non si te ruperis, inquit,

Par eris.

Haec a te non multum abludit imago.

Adde poemata nunc, hoc est, oleum adde camino ς
Quae si quis sanus fecit- sanus facis et tu.

huilding, which is as much as to say, you,
who are a dwarf two feet high, are aping

‘You are is the

dative governed by ‘certare-³
[comp. Epod. ii. 20.]
314. Absenti: ranae] This fable is told

the aira of a giant ς and yet you laugh at by Phaedrus (ἱ. 24). The reader- will have

'1⁸me swelling with a spirit too big for
his little body-³ Horace may have been
making some additions to his Sabine house,

no difficulty in following the narrative of
Horace with the punctuation 1 have given,
which in the main is that of Heindorf and

and about this time Maecenas built his fflrelli. Great difficulty has been raised by

largehouse on the Esquiliae (see S. i. 8,
luti-od.)- Turbo is a name found in in-
scn‘ptions. [Ritter says that this satire
was written in ΔΑΜ). 725, and that Horace
· in this year had begun to build a house in
Rome ς and that two years later, when he
noto C. iii. 1, he had either finished the
house or was near finishing it, which fact
*Bina proves by vv. 45, 46 of C. iii.1;
and he further proves by the evidence of
0. ii. 18. 1-6, that the decorations of this
houm were simple. Ritter’s notions of
praef will not be accepted by sensible
ple. He has some better evidence of
once having had a house in Rome in the
Scholiast on Juvenal i. 12, and a letter of
Fronto, ii. 4. 5 13].

312. verum est] δίκαιόν dcv-«3 ‘is it
right? ’ Compare Caesar, Β. G. iv. 8:
“Neque verum esse qui suos fines tueri
non potuerint alienos occupare.” In the
next verse ‘tantum’ was restored on the
authority of the oldest Blandinian MS. by
Bentley, in whose time the received read-
ing was ‘ tanto? A similar construction
occurs immediately below (ver. 317), ‘ tan-
tum magna‚’ where ‘ tandem' has got
into most MSS. and editions. ‘Multum
similis' (S. ii. 5. 92), ‘ multum dissimilis'
(Epp. i. 10. 3), are like phrases. ⁶ Tanto ’

the little frog's reply, that the ox was
only ‘major dimidio' than his mother.
Bentley is particularly disturbed by this
absurdity. He himself (he says) would
have written ‘major nummo? Hein-
dorf suggests di lly that the
young frog is laughing at his parent. We
may at any rate admit that ‘greater by
half’ is a conventional way of speaking,
which can seldom be interpreted very
literally3 and the inaccuracy of the little
frog may be excused. There is more diffi-
culty in the words that follow, ‘num
tanto? ’ Bentley follows Cruquius in chang-
ing ‘tanto' into ‘tantum‚' and quotae
the Leyden and Trinity College MSS. as
his authority. But ‘ tanto ’ is the reading
of every other MS. and edition except two
or three, who have follow'ed Bentley. By
‘ num tanto ' the frog means to ask whether
the calf was so much bigger than her na-
tural size, as by puffing she had made her·
self. ‘Is it so much bigger?' she says,
blowing herself out to proportions much
greater than her own.

else. It meam, to be out of harmony
with.

sanos Helicone poetas Democritus? 'l'he
