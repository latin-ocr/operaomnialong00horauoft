” LATIN VERSE BOOK. An Introduetory Work on

Hexameters and Pentameters. By the an. P. ῈΒΟΒΤ, Μ.Α., St.
J ohn’s College, Cambridge. 3³.

This work is divided into two Parte. Pim Ι. is an introduction to
Latin Elegiae verse for the use of beginners‚ commencing with words
to be arranged in their proper metrical order. The exeroises are
then varied by giving certain En lish sentences, translated from Ovid and other
writers, with the words necessary or rendering them into Latin verse. The number
of words supplied is gradually diminished. PAR-r II. consists of selections from Eng—
lish Poets, commencing with very simple ones, for translation into Latin verse. Hints
are given in the notes, suggesting appropriate renderings; but this help is gradually
diminished, till the scholar is able to stand alone.

After working through this book the student will be prepared for independent
composition, or for the study of Lyric versification.
