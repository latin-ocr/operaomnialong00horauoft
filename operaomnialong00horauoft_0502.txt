have been a mercator. (Introduction.)
All the MSS. and Acron have ‘ Mercuriale.’
Sanadon and some others have the dative,
which is the more usual construction. See
below, v. 47 n., and Key's L. G. 984 note.
See also Gellius xv. 29: “Duae istae in
loquendo figurae notae satis usitataeque
sunt ‘Mihi nomen est Julius’ et ‘mihi
nomen est J ulio.' ’³ ‘ Compita ’ were those
spots where two or more streets converged
to a point or crossed one another. At

- these places idlers lounged‚ and passengers
sometimes stopped to offer a prayer to the
Lares publici or Compitales, whose altars
were erected there. (See v. 281 11.)

27. morbi purgatum] This genitive fol-
lows the Greek construction. ‘Purgare’
comes under the category of verbs of re-
moval and separation referred to in Key's
L. G. 940, where he quotes this example
and O. ii. 9. 17, “ desine mollium Tandem
querelarum‚” where see note. Horace
calls the man's mania for bargains a
disease, and he is surprised how he ever
got over it. ‘Buff says he, ‘you have
only exchanged that disorder for another
(that of giving advice where it is not
wanted), as the patient in a lethargy has
been known suddenly to jump up and
assault the doctor. Provided however you
don’t follow his example, be *it as you
please.’ On ‘ trajecto' Porphyrion re-
marks, “ Proprie ‘ trajecto ;' ita enim
medici dicunt.” ‘Miser' is also said to
be 0 medical word for ‘diseased.’ ‘Hic’
means ‘any one,’ ‘such 011 one.' [The
words ‘Atqui . . . urget’ 010 given to
Damasippus by OreHi, Ritter, and Kriiger,
who thus make nonsense of the passage,
as Doederlein, Ι think, has shown. Orelli
maintains that ‘Atqui' proves that the
words ‘Atqui . . . urget' are not Horace's
words, which is a weak objection].

31. Ο bone, ne te Frustrere] ‘ My good
sir, (lon’t deceive yourself.' We have ‘o

bone ' (S. 6. 51), like the Greek ὦ ’γαθεῖ

32. prope omnes] Stertinius would not
allow of any exceptions to this rule (see
note on v. 44), and ⁶ prope’ therefore may
be looked upon, not as limiting ‘ omnes,'
but perhaps as sostening the expressim 0
little. It is hard to give the word a. dis-
tinct meaning in C. iv. 14. 20, and in this
Satire v. 268. Τ110 Greeks use ὥς ἔπος
εἰπεῖν 111 the same way.

33. Stertinius] See lntroduction. ‘ Crepo’
is nowhere else used in 0 good sense, and
it is put into Damasippus' mouth ironi-
cally. ‘Unde ’ἢ may mean ‘from whom,’
i. e. Stertinius, or from which preaching,
the antecedent implied 111,ε crepat?

35. pascere baa-bam] See above, v. 1'7 n.
πωγωνοτροφεῖν 18 0 term used by the later
Greek writers. The Pons Fabricius con-
nected the Insula Tiberina with the left

bank, and was just outside the walls, ,

facing the south end of the Mons Capito-
linus. It was (Δ.11.σ. 692) rebuilt with
stone, having been formerly (as may be
supposed) made of wood. (Dion Cass.
xxxvii. 45.) The ruins of this bridge bear
the name Ponte di Quattro Capi. The
Fabricius who built it, and whom Comm.
Cruq. calls Consul, was Curator Viarum,
as appears by an inscription upon one of
the arches. The same Scholiast says in
his time it was called Pons Lapideus,
which may have been the common name.
