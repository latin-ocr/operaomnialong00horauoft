226 Ι HORATII FLACCI

but not more than was unavoidable in alluding to Augustus as the fountain of those
virtues which appeared in Drusus. Not to have alluded to 'liberius would have been
as unnatural as to have omitted a more speeific mention of his part in the war had he
joined it when the ode was written. Bentley's notion that Drusus only attacked and
defeated the Vindelici and Tiberius the Raeti is ridiculous. He is led to it by v. 18 of this
ode and 10 sqq.of C.14,and by the statement of Velleius (ii. 95), “Uterque divisis partibus

Raetos Vindelicosque aggressi,” which merely means that they divided their forces, and

attaeked the tribes in different quarters, as Livy (xliv. 11) says of the taking of cas-

sandrea, “ Divisis partibus oppugnare adorti praetor et Eumenes.’' The two tribes and
the minor tribes connected with them were united in one league, und the idea of the >

Vindelici being attacked in or near the territories of the Raeti (“ Raetis sub Alpibus ⁹³),

while the Raeti themselves looked on and waited, as J ani says, for Tiberius' arrival, is

absurd. I am surprised that Franke adopts this notion on a literal interpretation of

Horaee's words.

ARGUMENT.

Like the young eagle just darting on its prey, οι· the young lion fresh from its dam, was
Drusus when he met the rude Vindelici, and made them feel what hem-ts could do
trained under the eye of Augustus. The brave give birth to the brave. The steer
and the horse have the blood of their sires, and the eagle gives not birth to the dove.
But education brings out the seeds of virtue. What Rome owes to the Nerones let
the Metaurus witness, and the day which saw Hasdrubal defeated and drove the
clouds and the fier-ce African from Latium. Our strength has grown and our gods
have returned from that day, and Hannibal was forced to cry, “As the deer might
pursue the wolf, we are pursuing those we should fly. Like the shorn oak they gain
strength with every blow, as the Hydra or the monsters of Thebes. Sink them in
the deep, they rise more glorious than ever, and overthrow their victor in his strength.
No more shall Ι send messengers of victory to Carthage; fallen, fallen are our hopes,
and our fortune, for Hasdrubal is gone !'’ The hand of a Claudius will prosper, for
Jove and sagacity deliver him from danger.
