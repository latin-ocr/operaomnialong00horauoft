HORATII FLACCI

Hunc vexare locum curae sunt atque labori,
Quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis

Humanos animos.

Has nullo perdere possum

Nec prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum .
Protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes,
Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla
Canidiam pedibus nudis passoque capillo,

Cum Sagana majore ululantem ε pallor utrasque

Fecerat horrendas adspectu.

on their abominable practices. We need
not infer with Dacier that the place was
not yet entirely changed or cleared of the
bones that disfigured it, but may suppose
the witches still continued to haunt the
scene of their iniquities, and that the
‘fures' and ‘ferae‚’ are the depredators
that came to rob the gar-dens which were
the god’s particular care. I am not aware
of any other instance of ‘suetus' being
used as a trisyllable. Lucretius so uses
‘ suevit :³ “ Qui ferri quoque vim penetrare
“ suevit.'’

23. Vidi egomet niqra] The god pro-
ceeds to relate a scene, in which the cha-
racters introduced are the notorious Cani-
dia of whom we have seen enough in the
Epodes, and Sagana, who is associated with
her iu Epod. v. 25. Their appearance and
behaviour are much the same as there.
The principal person is Canidia, who wears
a dark ‘palla‚’ is without shoes, and has
her hair dishevelled (in Epod. v. 15 it is
tangled with little snakes). The moon is
up and she invokes her (Epod. v. 50), while
her companion invokes one of the furies.
They are both deadly pale. They grub up
the earth with their nails, and pour into
the hole the blood of a black lamb (black
victims were sacrificed to the infernal
deities), which they tear to -pieces with
their teeth, by which process they hope to
evoke spirits of the dead to answer their
inquiries about their lovers. Canidia has

hide the beard of a wolf and the tooth of a
spotted snake in the ground as a counter-
charm to thwart their adversaries, the
Manes which have been evoked converse
with them in a melancholy sharp voice3
and just when the flames which were to
melt the devoted image of wax are at their
height the ludicrous catastrophe happens
that puts them all to flight,—Canidia with
her jaws chattering with fright, and her
false teeth dropping out, Sagana with her
{affitflyssffin‘ffffabffi‘fflss ῗιῖξέῗὲξίἔέξθ ¹3:321}
of their way to the city.

-- niqra‘sueeinetmn vadere palla] The
‘palla' was the upper garment worn by
women ont of doors as the men wore the
toga. (S. i. 2. 29 n.) Here, in conse-
quence of the expression ‘succinctam‚'
Heindorf and other commentatore, and
Forcellini, suppose ‘palla’ to be put loosely
for the under gai-ment, which was ga-
thered up and girt under the breast. But
there is no necessity for this supposition.
‘ Succinctam ³ does not refer to ‘palla’ at
all, but merely signifies ‘expeditam,’ as in
Epod. v. 25. It is equivalent to ‘prae-
cinctis' in S. i. 5. 6 n. It occurs again
1Sl. ii. 6. 107: “veluti succinctus cursitat

os s.”

ἐξ Cum Sagana majore] The Scho-
liasts say that Sagana was the freedwoman
of one Pomponius, and that she had a
younger sister, whence she is called ‘ma-

two images, one of wool and the other of jor.’ It probably signifies that she was

wax, the first representing herself, the
other her faithless lover, on whom she is
going to wreak her vengeance. We may
suppose it therefore to represent the un-
happy Varus of Epod. v. Snakes and
Hecate's hounds sui-round them, and at
the height of their incantations the moon
blushes with shame, and hides her face
behind the tombs (great barrows perhaps,
formed by the burial of a number of corpses
in one pit). During the rites, in which they

older than Canidia, as Doering sayS.

27. pullam] Aeneas offers a black lamb
to Nox and Terra (Aen. vi. 249): “Ipse
atri velleris agnam Aeneas matri Eumeni-
dum magnaeque sorori Ense ferit.'' Ti-
bullus uses the same word as Horace (i. 2.

61) :

“ Et me lustravit taedis, et nocte serena
Concidit ad magicos hostia pulla deos.'’
