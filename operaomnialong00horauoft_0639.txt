EPISTLE XI.

'ni-Epium· is addressed to oneBullatius, of whom we know nothing. He was
huvelling‘ ιιι the Aegean and in Asia Minor, and was absent longer than Horace
wished, or thought good for him, and the object of this letter is to induce him
to return. The commentatore generally have a very mean opinion of Bullatius,
who lus suffered at their hands harder measure than any of Horaee’s friends.
But his chief viee seems to have been a fondness for travelling, and an especial
admirationofsomeofthefinestandmostancienttownsintheworld. Ifweare
tonddtothisthat forsomereasonorother he πμ unhappy‚ and expected to
relieve himselfby change of scene, he may have been mistaken in his means, but
if ιιι, plenty of people have shared in his mistake, and when Hor-aee puts before
Bullatiu- as the end of life the enjoyment of the present nomene—⁸ doctrine he
tems to have held pretty strongly,—we may doubt whether his philosophy is not
at lant as‘bad as his friend’s practice. But we need not assume any thing injurioua
to Bullatium Such reflections upon travel as occur in this Epistle might naturally
have suggested themselves whomsoever it had been written to. We must not judge
Rmes’s Epistles as we would private letters, meant only for the reading of the
pnsum they ue written to.

we have no means of knowing when the Epistle was written.

’ ARGUMENT.

, what think you, Bullatius, of the fine places of the East? are they not all tame
mpered with our Campus and 'siber Ρ Have you set your henrt upon one of
Aua-lue town& or are you so tired of travelling that you must settle down at
Lebedus, the dullest of places, as you know? And yet 1 could live there will-
ingly, 1 confess, forgetting home and every body, to look out upon the stormy sea.
But the traveller who turns in to his tavern to rest would not stay there for ever 3
and he who wax-ms himself by the fire or a hot bath does not make these the end
of his life. So if you have been tempest-tosn and have been glad to put into port,
is thet any reason why you should sell your ship and never come back Ρ These
parts ase very well for siek people, but as long as health and fortune let you be at
Rome, stay here and praise Samos and the rest at a distance. Be thankful for the
blessings of the day, and live for the present hom-5 so will you be happy whatever
place you may be in. ’Tis reason that takes away sorrow, and we only change our
elime when we shist our place. It is but a busy idleness that employs us when we
seek happiness in ships and in oeaehea. All you want is here or at dull Umbrae, if
your heart be true and fail you not.
