mii INTRODUCTION.

C. ii. 18.—This Ode stands alone. The metre has its name from ,

Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consiste of three trochees,
followed by a single syllable, long οι· short:

The second of five trochees preceded by such a syllable:

εΙ-υΙ-εΙ-υΙ-υΙ-ε
C. iii. 12.——This Ode is also unlike any other. It is usual to divide
it into feet called Ionio Minor ( υ υ ,- -), of which the two first verses
coutain four each, and the third contains two. Respecting this metre,
see Bentley’s note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject
of an Ode of Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metre also. The
Greek, as usual, has a much finer effect than the imitation.

C. iv. 7.—This metre takes its name from Archilochus, and con-
sists of an hexameter verse, followed by a verse which is the latter half
of a pentameter. There are no other Odes in this measure.

Epod. i.—x.—The first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondees
only in the uneven placeS. An anapaest is once introduced in ii. 35.

Epod. xi.—This is one of the variations of the iambic introduced
by Archilochus. The first verse is a trimeter iambic. The second is
ἃσυνάρτητος, consisting of the last half of a pentameter followed by a
dimeter iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of
vv. 6, 10, 26, and the hiatus in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this
metre which may be consulted.

Epod. xiii.-—This metre consists of an hexameter verse, with one
made up, as Epod. xi„ of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the
difference being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xiv„ xv.—These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dimeter iambic.

Epod.. xvi.—This consists of an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
iambic verse.

Epod. nit-This consists entirely of trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

The rule laid down by Meineke‚ and adopted by many editors, which
affirms that the Odes which consist of single lines, or lines in alternate
measure, are to be divided into stanzas of four νει-865, appears to me
too doubtful to be adopted.
