For his strictures therefore upon this
reading Bentley has an account to settle
with his friend, whose opinion he probably
did not know. for he does not mention
him. His objections are that ‘palma'

cannot be separa ted from ‘evehit’ with·

written his notes in English, the greater
part of them would only have raised a
mile. This argumentis a fair-specimen of
his criticism. He settlcs the question by
changing ‘ evehit ¹ into ‘ evehere,’ which 119
makes dependent ou ‘ nobilis, ·’ whereby he

Paulus (Dig. 50. 16. 137)= “Ter enixa vi-
