Occupat et salvere jubet 'prior.

HORATII FLACCI

Ille Philippo

Excusare laborem et mercenaria vincla,
Quod non mane domum venisset, denique quod non

Providisset eum.

“ Sic ignovisse putato
Me tibi si coenas hodie mecum.” “ Ut libet.” “ Ergo

70

Post nonam venies; nunc i, rem strenuus auge.”
Ut ventum ad coenam est, dicenda. tacenda locutus

Tandem dormitum dimittitur.

Hic ubi saepe

Occultum visus decurrere piscis ad hamum,

Mane cliens et jam certus conviva, jubetur

75

Rura suburbana indictis comes ire Latinis.
Impositus mannis arvum caelumque Sabinum

Non cessat laudare.

Videt ridetque Philippus,

Et sibi dum requiem, dum risus undique quaerit,

says: “ Semta, quas vulgus grutas vocat :’'
it is from the Greek -γρύτη, aud was used
by Lucilius (Gell. iii. 14), with the cognate
word ‘ scrutarius ε’

.“ Quidni? et scruta quidem ut vendat
Praigi'ilatdgihs lsffiffiem, soleam improbus
dimidiatam.''

As to ‘occupat' see C. ii. 12. 28 n. [and S.
i. 9. 6 .

67. ]mercenaria vincla] The bonds (that
is, the occupationis) of buyiug and selling.
Mena offers these as his excuse for not
having waited upon Philippus in the
morning at his ‘salutatio,’ as aster his
attention of the previous day, he would
have felt bound to do if he could.

69. Sic] See Key's L. G. 1451, 9. note.

71. Post nonam venies] See above,
v. 47 n. and C. i. 1. 20 n.

. 72. dicenda tacenda loeutus] This is a
familiar adaptation of the Greek ῥητὸν
ἅῤῥητόν τ’ ἔπος (Soph. Oed. Col. 1001),
which was >a conventional phrase. It
means all manner of things. Persius (iv.
5) -has “dicenda tacendaque calles.’' Vir-
gil (Aen. ix. 595): “digna atque indigna
relatu Vociferans.’' Volteius was placed
at his ease by his host, aud, being a simple
man, talked of what came uppermost
whether it was out of season or not. “ Lo-
cutus .· Volteius, velut plebeius, expers
rerum '’ (Comm. Cruq.). This gives the
meaning very well. ⁴ Dimittere’ was a
word of politeness used among equals as

above, v. 18.
73. Hic ubi s aepe] After he had broken

the ice Volteiusaep was easily persuaded to

repeat his visits, and at last he became an
established guest and a daily attendant at
the rich man’s morning receptions, till on
one occasion he was invited ω aceompany
Philippus to his country seat in the Sabine
country during the ‘feriae Latinae? At
this festival, which was of the highest
antiquity‚ a sacrifice was offered on the
Alban Mount, which sacrifice had been
offered before Rome was built. Tarqui·
nius Superbus first converted it into a
Roman festival. Niebuhr sa‘ ys(ii. 34), by
which he means thnt whereasy it had before
been presided over by the Latin dictator,
the Roman king, when the Latius were
brought into close alliance with Rome,
took that place himself 3 and though the
Latius continued to send their own magis·
trates till they lost their independence, the
chief magistrates of Rome continued to
preside over the sacrifice which was still
offered on the Alban Mount. The holi-
days lasted four, or as some critics affirm,
six days, during which business was sus-
pended. They were ‘feriae conceptivae,’
that is, they were annual, but not held al-
ways at the same semion, which is what
Horace means by calling them ‘indictam’

The consuls appointed the time of their
celebration.

[77. Imposita-s· mannis] In a ‘'rheda
drawn by horses, as some say· like Homer's
ἵππων ἐπιβησόμενον, as Kriiger suggesth

79. dum requiem, dum vim] ]Philip
tired with his work, refreshed himse
getting amusement at other people' s exy
pense. He gave the man a sum equivalent
to about 60l. of our money, and offered to
{end him as much more.
