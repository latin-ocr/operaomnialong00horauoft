it is only taken from the Greek ἄναλκις,
which goes commonly with ἀπτόλεμος (as
Doering says). In the next line Bentley
reads‘ sim' on the conjecture of N. Hein-
sius‚‘ ‘ut respondeat τῳ juvemss 'which I
do not understand. ‘Sum futurus’ is a
direct answer to the supposed question.
19. Ue assidens] ‘As the bird that sits
by her unfledged brood is more afraid of
the serpent's stealthy approach if she
leave them, and yet, if she were with
them, she could give no more help though
they should be under her wing.' ‘ Relictis'
Ι take with Dacier to be the ablative abso-
lute. For ‘ut adsit,’ Bentley reads ‘uti
sit ’ with a few MSS. But it does not make
very good sense. The objection to the
tautology in‘ ut adsit’ and‘ praesentibus’
need not weigh against the received read-
ing. See Ter. (Adelph. iii. 3. 39). “Non
quia ades praesens dico hoc. '³ Ib. (iv. 5.
34)· . “Cum hanc sihi videbit praesens

praesentem eripi.”
23. militabitur bellum] The Scholiast
says of this‚‘ ‘Nove et eloquenter dixit?
‘Eleganter et nove' is Baxter’s opinion,
a‘udaciter et nove' Dillenburger’s. But
Plautus has the same expression (Pers. ii.
2. 50)· . “At confidentia illa militia mili-
tatur multo magis quam pondere.'’ See
also C. iii. 19. 4: “bella pugnata‚” which
expression is repeated Epp. i. 16. 25. ‘ In
spem‚' ‘ looking to the hope,' 15 used where
we should say ‘in the hope? ‘Mea' and
