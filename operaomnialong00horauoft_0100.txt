HORATII FLACCI

TE maris et terrae numeroque carentis arenae '
Mensorem cohibent, Archyta,
Pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
Munera, nec quidquam tibi prodest
Aerias tentasse domos animoque rotundum 5
Percurrisse polum morituro.
Occidit et Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum,
Tithonusque remotus in auras
Et J ovis arcanis Minos admissus, habentque

Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco

Demissum, quamvis clipeo Trojana refixo
Tempora testatus nihil ultra

Nervos atque cutem morti concesserat atrae,
J udice te non sordidus auctor

Naturae verique. 'Sed omnes una manet nox

Et calcanda semel via leti:
Dant alios Furiae torvo spectacula Marti5
Exitio e‘st avidum mare nautis3

1. Te mavis et terrae] ‘Te’ is emphatic,
as the abruptness of the opening requires.
ἅμμον μετρεῖν, κύματα μετρεῖν (Theoc-
xvi. 60), were proverbial expressions for
lost labour. See Pind. Ol. 13. 46 and
Georg. ii. 104 sqq. :—
f“1geque enim numero comprendere

re er ς
Queim qui scire velit, Libyci velit aequoris

Dicere quam multae Zephyro turbentur

arenae. '

Archimedes’ work ὁ ψαμμίτης may be al-
luded to here. See Dict. of Greek and
Roman Biography, art. Archimedes. There
is no reason to suppose that Archytas at-
tempted the problem.

3. Pulveris est-iqui -parva -- Munera]
See Introduction. ⁴ Munus ’ may be ren—
dered as in the Argument.—[‘litus Mati-
num.’ Ritter attempts to prove that the
‘litus Matinum ' is the ‘ Tarentinum Cala-
briae litus‚’ but the evidence is not suffi-
cient ‚· nor is there any evidence that the
‘litus Matinum' is in the Garganus, ex-
cept the resemblance of a name.]

6. Pereurrisse polum] “Atque omne
iImmensum peragravit mente animoque‚”

uer. i. 75.

9. Minos] Called by Hom. (Odyss. xix.
179) Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής, the grandson
of him who became judge in Hades.

10. Panthoiden] Pythagoras, in order
to prove his doctrine of metempsychosis,

 

declared that he had been Euphorbus the
son of Panthous who fell in the Trojan
war. In support of this assertion he
claimed as his own a shield hung up in the
temple of J uno at Argos, which when taken
down proved to have the name of Euphor-
bus engraved on it. The nearest transla—
tion that I can give of what follows ‘quam-
vis clipeo,’ διο. is, ‘ although, by taking
down the shield and testifying to the season
of the Tr0jan war, he proved that he had
surrendered nothing but his sinews and his
skin to death?

11. quamvis] “The poetS,together with
Livy and later writers, use ‘quamvis ' with
an indicative, and vice versa ‘quanquam’
with a subjunctive ’³ (Key’s Grani. 1227 b.
note). [But the usage is not so absolute
as it is here stated to be.] Horace uses the
subjunctive where the case is strictly hypo·
thetical, as C. iv. 2. 39, or where it suits
the metre, as in C. iv. 6. ¹7.

14. Judice te] See Introduction.

non sordidus auctor Naturae verique]
i.e. ‘ no mean teacher of truth physioal aud
moraL' or, as we should say, ‘no mean au-
thority’ on such subjects. cicero says of
Plato (Orat. c. 3) : “Has rerum formas ap·
pellat ideas ille non intelligendi solum sed
etiam dicendi gravissimus auctor et magis-
te1·,'' and of Caecilius: “malus auctor La-
tinitatis est'’ (Ad. Att. vii. 3). “A trust-
worthy person, one on whose evidence we
can rely, is ‘auctor idoneus? Livy calls
