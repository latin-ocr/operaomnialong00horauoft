“ Hoc quoque, Tiresia, praeter nan-ata petenti
Responde, quibus amissas reparare queam res

Artibus atque modis.

Quid rides?” “ J amne doloso

Non setis est Ithacam revehi patriosque penates

Adspicere?” “ Ο nulli quidquam mentite, vides ut 5
Nudus inopsque domum redeam, te vate, neque illie

Aut apotheoe procis intacta est aut pecus ς atqui

Et genus et virtus nisi eum re vilior alga est.'’

‘⁴' Quando pauperiem, missis ambagibus, horres,

Accipe qua ratione quaes ditescere.

8. Quid rides] These words appear to
bo spoken by ulysses, though some editors
fiko them otherwise. Tiresias may be
