EPISTLE XV.

This Epistle, as the chronologists rightly assume, is not likely to have been written
before ΔΑΜ). 731, when Antonius Musa and his cold remedies came into fashion (v. 3 n.).
How long afterwards it may have been written is uncertain.

Vaala was the cognomen given to one C. Numonius for storming the vallum of a camp,
as appears from a coin with his head on one side, and the above exploit represented on
the other. The Scholiasta say nothing of Horace's friend, but the MSS. inscriptions
call him C. Numenius Vala. There was one of that name who was a legatus of Varus,
and pcrished with his army in Ger-many A.U.c. 763, thirty years or more aster this
Epistle was written. He may have been this man or his son. Estre has given an
inscription found at Philae in Egypt, in which it appears that two persons—L. Trebo-
nius and O. Numonius Vala—were at that place “ Λα). VIII. K. Aprilis,” in the yem-
, when Augustus was consul the thirteenth time, that is, A.U.c. 752. If thisbe Horaoe’s
friend, as it may, he was a traveller like Bullatius, and has succeeded in recording his
travels for a longer time than he expected. But this does not help us to distinguish
him from many travellers who ,have carved their ignoble names upon the sphinxes‚
obelisks‚ and Pyramids of Egypt.

Vala was acquainted with the southern coast of Italy, and Horace, who had been
recommended by his pbysician no longer to go as he had been wont to Baiae, had a
mind to try one of the southern ports, and he writes to Vala for information about
them. It is an unconnected sort of Epistle, with a long digression upon the lament of
Baiae at the loss of her invalida, and another upon wines‚ and a third, which occupiae
half the Epistle, upon the profligacy of one Maenius, who squandered all his money
on good living, and then turned to living at the expense of others. When he had no-
thing better‚ he ate tripe aud abused all spendthrifts, and as soon as he had any money
he spent it in the same way again. Such am l, says Horace ; when 1 am short of
money I commend the serenity of a humble life 3 when a windfall drops in, 1 am ready
to be as extravagant as you please.

The connexion of this with the professed object of the letter I do not quite see.
