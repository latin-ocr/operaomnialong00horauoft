HORATII FLACCI

Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.

Nihilo deterius dominae jus esse. Rogabat

Tendimus hinc recta Beneventum, ubi sedulus hospes

60. miniteris] The MSS. and editions
are divided between this form and the m-
dicative. The subjunctive alone is right,
and I have adop ted it with Bentley and

Ven. 1483. See pKey' s L. G. 1455‚j
63. Pastor em saltaret] That he should

dance the Cyclops dance, in which the·

uncouth gestures of Polyphemus courting
Galatea were represented. See Epp. ii. 2.
125: “Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem
Cyclopa movetur.” Ovid (Trist. ii. 519)
uses ‘ salto ’ in the passive voice: “Et mea
sunt populo saltata poemata saepe.’'

65. Dorcas-set jamne catenam] “ Urba.
nius haec dicta sunt in Sarmentum qui
servilibus erat natalibus, sumpta transla-
tione a generosis pueris, qui egressi annos
pueritiae jam sumpta toga Diis penatibus
bullas suas consecrabant, ut et puellae
pupas '’ (Comm. Cruq.). [‘ Ex voto ε’
‘ pursuant to his vow.' The word ‘votum’
occurs in some inscriptions.]

67. ,Nihilo deterius] The editions, till
Baxter (who has ‘Nilo ³), have ‘deterius
nihilo.’ Bentley says that all the oldest
and best MSS. have‘ nihilo deterius? He
adopts it, and so do Dillenbr. and Orelli,

‘nihilo’ being pronounced as a dissy lla.-
ble‚ like‘ ‘vehemens et liquidus” (Epp. ii.
2120). [Ritter has‘ nilo. '] Fea quotes
a great many MSS. in favour of the old
reading. [‘ Dominae jus. ’the rights of
his mistress over him. ]

68. anafarris libra] The allowance of
‘far’ to each slave was four or five ‘modii’
by the mouth, and it was served out to
them monthly, or sometimes daily (Epp.‘ 1.
14. 40). That allowance would give three
pints a day, which Messius considers would
be three times as much as Sarmentus could
possibly require3 so he could not better

himself by running away. The ‘ far' was
otherwise called ‘adoreum,’ and seems to
have been the same as the Greek ζειὰ οι·
ὄλυρα. sse nature of this grain is not
exactly known. That two persons above
the condition of slaves should be found 111
waiting on any man, great or otherwise,
for the purpose of entertaining him witli
such low buffoonery as the above, seems
surprising to us· ‚ but we know that there
was no personal de tion to which this
class of people called ‘parasitos’ (‘ diuers
out ') would not demean themselves for the
ples-sure of a good dinner and the company
of the great. The entertainment of these
persons would serve to keep the conversa-
tion from turning upon politica which, ms
the deputies from both sides were now
together, it was desirable to avoid.

71. Beneventum] The Appia Vi». took
a north-east turn from Caudium for eleven
or twelve miles till it came to Beneventum
(Benevento), a very ancient town, by tra-
dition said to have been founded by Dio-
medes, and the name of which was ori·
ginally, when the Samnites had it, Maleven-
tum, or some name that sounded so like
Maleventum to a Latin ear that the Romans
thought fit to change it (for good luck)
to Beneventum. In no town but Rome
are there so many ancient remains as in
Benevento. Nearly all the walls are built
of altars, tombs, columns, &c- ς and the
arch of Trajan, erected probably in com-
memoration of his construction of the
roaael from Beneventum to Brundusium
(since the same year, Aa). 114, appears on
the arch that is found on the milliary co·
lumns along the read), still remains in
pretty good preservation. Thither the

party proceeded next day, and put up
