CARMEN V.

A.u.c. 7 40.

This ode was written after the German victories celebrated in the last ode and C. 14,
and perhaps sent to Augustus in Gaul AALC. 740. What were the reasons for the
Emperor's protracted absence we cannot tell, but we need not on that account give credit
to the conjectures mentioned before (C. iv. 2, Introduction). It was perhaps the policy
of Augustus to make his absence felt, and we may believe that the language of Horace,
which bears much more the impression of real feeling than of flattery, represented the
sentiments of great numbers at Rome, who felt the want of that presiding genius which
had brought the city through its long troubles aud given it comparative peace. There
could not be a more comprehensive picture of security and rest obtained through the
influence of one mind than is represented in this ode, if we except that with which no
merely mortal language can compare (Isaiah xi. and lxv. Micah iv.). The Carmen
Saeculare contains much that is repeated here. Virgil’s description in his fourth
Eclogue will naturally occur to the reader.

ARGUMENT.

'1¹00 long hast thou lest. us, our guardiam fulfil thy promise and return as the spring to
gladden our hearts. As the mother for her absent son, so does Rome sigh for her
Caesar. Our fields are at peace, the very sea is at rest, our morals are pure, our
women are chaste, the law is strong, our enemies are silenced, each man lives in quiet
and blesses thy name as Greece that of Castor or Hercules. Long mayst thou be
spared to bless us, is our prayer both morning and evening.
