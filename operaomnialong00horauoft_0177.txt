CARMINUM III. 2.

Virtus repulsae nescia. sordidae
*Intaminatis fulget honor-ihm,
Nec sumit aut ponit secur&

Arbitrio popularis aurae.

Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque ¹volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.

Est et fideli tuta silentio

Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit areanae sub isdem
, Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum

Bon s reason is odd—that there was

'to ‘poplitibus’ but coupled with

‘Nescia' seems to menn ‘unoouscious of,’
beaune ‘indifferent to' the disgrace of re·

⁴- . joacim, which, if disgraoeful to any, is not

so bo the vix-tuom, but to those who reject
them. Dillenhr. interprete otherwise, that
tho vitemus do not seek honours, and
therefooe do not know the discredit of de—
rum but that is contrary to fact, and
therefore not likely to be Horace’s mean·

ω. Arbitrio popular-is aurae] Thi·
means that the popular judgment is like a
shisting breeze, setting now this way, now
that, as in Vix-gil (Aen. vi. 817) :—

“Nimium gaudens popularibus auris,''
and in Lucan (ἰ 132) :—

“ Totus popularibus auris
Impelli plausuque sui gaudere theatri?

Compare for the seutiments C. iv. 9. 39 sqq.

25. Est etfideli tuta silentio] Simonides,
in the same poem (Bergk says, p. ⁷67) from
which the former quotation eomes (v. 14
n.), says—

ἑστὶ καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίνδυνον γέρας,

which words A was aoquainted with
and approved. When Athenodorus was
about to leave his camp he embraced the
emperor aud said, “O Caesar, whenever
thou art wroth, say nothing, do nothing,
till thou hast gone over in thy mind the
twenty-four letters of the alphabeta-’¹
Whereupou the emperor took him by the
hand and said, “ Ι have need of thee still ;”
and he detained him a whole year, saying,
“ Silenee too hath its safe reward.” (Plut.
Apophthegm. Reg- et Imper. Caaear. Aug.
⁷.) Secrecy is a sign of good saith, and
not an one to practise. Horaee's ins
dignation is levelled against the breaking
of saith generally, and the divulging of the
secrets of Ceroe (whose ritas, however, it
appears were only attended by women) is
only mentioned by way of illustration-
Doering suggaets, by way of accounting for
the introduction of this particular virtue,
that some notorious act of treachery is
referred to indirectly. But the introduc-
tion of that virtue does not require an
apology. There are few moral qualities
that can bc mid to take precedence of it.
