622 HORATII FLACCI

Quidquid erat nactus praedae majoris ubi omne
Verterat in fumum et cinerem, Non hercule miror,
Aiebat, si qui comedunt bona, cum sit obeso

Nil melius turdo, nil vulva pulchrius ampla.
Nimirum hic ego sum; nam tuta et parvula laudo
Cum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis 3

Verum ubi quid melius contingit et unctius idem
Vos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum
Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.

of the MSS. are ‘correctus' and ‘cor-
reptus' The authority for each of these
readings may be learnt fr0m Obbarius or
Fea. The MS. authority for ‘corrector'
is very small [perhaps none. ‘Correctus

natural: how could any thing better be

that, like his neighbours‚ he professes love
for poverty while he is poor, but as soon
as he gets any money, he is ready for any
extravagance.

EPISTLE XVI.

QuintiuS, to whom this Epistle is addressed, cannot be identified with any known ,

person. The same name is connected with the eleventh Ode of the second book?
but there is no reason to suppose them to belong to one person. There is no
more reason in the Epistle than in the Ode why a name should appear at 2113 for
the subject is general, that being the liability of men to be deceived in respect to their
own goodness and that of others by the judgment of the multitude. This diaconi-se
follows rather abruptly a short description of Horace's residence, to understand which
any body who can get it should read the Abbe Capmartin de Ohaupy’s ‘ Deeouverte
de la Maison de Campagne .d'Horace,’ printed at Rome in 1767. It is written with
great vivacity and intefligence, though, as in such cases must always be expected,
with a tendency to strain his proofs and to attempt more precision than the· circum-
stances admit.
