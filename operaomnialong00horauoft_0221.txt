in preference to ‘ fastus‚' as being, he says,
more ancient. ‘Fastibus’ occurs in Lucan

To Bentley’s three MSS. Vanderburg 1188
added 8 fourth, also of the tenth century,
‘⁴ et exstitit haud dubie in pluribus aliorum

14. cras Genium mero Cicrabis] ‘Ge-
nium curare’ is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. ‘ Placare’
and ‘indulgere' are the usual words.
Mitsch. says, that “any mun of politeuess
will instinctively 888 that Horace means
politcly to offer himself as a guest at La·
mia's table;’' on which Orelli says that
such politenaes is a matter “ de qua vehe-
menter dubitare licet.” The commenta-
tors have with their usual accuracy done
their best to determine whether Lamia
was going really to offer sacrifice to his
genius, or whether Horace only meant him
to do so; aud also whether ‘curare' can
have reference to a sacrifice, or whether it
does not rather mean that Lamia was
going to keep his birthday next day ; to
which again it is objected that this could
not be, as blood was not shed in sacrifice
on birthday s; of which statement another
satisfactorily disposoe (03 iv. 11. 8 ιι). Ι
leave the reader to exercise his own j-udg
ment on the question. [‘ Quod et merum
et porcus bimestris Genio dari nunc dici-
tur, non satis accurate factum est: nam
vulgo Genium vino, Tellurem porco placa-
bant.’ Epp. ii. 1. 143—Ritter.]

16. operum solutis] This construction,
like‘ ‘desine querelarum” (C. ii. 9. 17), and
other expressions there quoted, is similar to
the Greek πόνου λελυμένοις. [Comp. S.
ii. 3. 27. ] On these constructione Prof.
Key says (L. G. ξ 940andnote),“-ocea
