Candida rectaque sit ; munda hactenus ut neque longa
Nee magis alba velit quam dat natura videri.

Nec vereor ne dum futuo vir rure recurrat,
Janua frangatur, latret canis, >undique magno
Pulsa domus strepitu resonet, vepallida lecto
Desiliat mulier, miseram se conseia elamet,
eruribus haec metuat, doti deprensa, egomet mi.

Ne nummi pereant aut puga aut denique fama.

coctum‚' and the note.

130. conscia] 'l'he ‘ancilla’ who was
privy to her mistress' adultery. Tol-ture
by breaking the legs was not unusual in
the case of slaves. ‘ Deprensa' means the
mistress caught in her crime, who feared
for her m ‘ portion, of which she was
liable tolose a. considerable part : one-sixth
might be retained by the husband, and
two-sixths for the children; but not more
man three-sixths could be taken away, if
(which is doubtful) this law existed when
Horace wrote. If not, we do not know
the particulare of the law which then
affected such casee3 but that adultery in-
volved the forfeiture of part of the ‘dos,’
is clear from the text. (See Ulpian. Fr.
Tit. de Dot. vi. 12.)

134 Fabio vel jndice vinem] As to
Fabius, see S. i. 14 n. [‘ Vincam’ means
‘ Ι will prove? If Fabius had been caught
himself, it would be easy to prove to him
that ‘deprendi miserum esse :' but, as
Ritter truly remarks, Horace sayS, ‘ Fabio
vel jndice,’ which must mean something
else. Ritter explains it thus: ‘Nimirum
Stoicus Fabius, ut ceteri ejusdem sectae
satellites, nihil miserum esse dicere sole-
bant, quod extrinsecus accidat? If Fabius
was a Stoic, this may be the meaning of
