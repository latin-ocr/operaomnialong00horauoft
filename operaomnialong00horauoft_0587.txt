Nodosa corpus nolis prohibere cheragra.

Est quadam prodire tenus si non datur ultra.
Fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus,
Sunt verba et voces quibus hunc lenire dolorem

Possis et magnam morbi deponere partem.

Laudis amore tumes, sunt certa piacula quae te
'l'er pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.
Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator,
Nemo adeo ferus est ut non mitescere possit,

Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem.

Virtus est vitium fugere et sapientia prima

may have been known ss the Hercules
Glyconis, ss we call it for distinction the
Farnoee Hercules, and that Horace called
it bricfly the Glycon (Spence, Polym.
p. 115). This conjecture is not without
mgenuity, for it would hardly be possible
to conceive a more prodigious representa-
tion of muscular strength and power of
limb than this statue shows, and Horace
was probably familiar with it. But the
above epigram confirming the Scholiasts’
mmtsaetsthe matter at rest. Comm.
. mentions ‘Milonis' as a various
, and one of the Vatican MSS. has
that name. Dacier quotes a saying off
Bpictetm (Diss. i. c. 2), which is much to
the purpose here: οὐδὲ γὰρ Μίλων ἔσομαι,
καὶ ὅμως οὐκ ἀμελῶ τοῦ σώματος, οὐδὲ
Κροῖσος, καὶ ὅμως σιὀκ ἆμελῖτῆς κτήσεως,

31. Nudam-prohibere cheragra] The
gout in the hand is called ‘ nodosa’ from
ih twisting the joiuts of the fingers (S. ii.
’1. 15). The construction of ⁶ prohibere'
with the accusative of the person and ab·
htive of the thingis
in ΕΠ). i. 8. 10.

Α 32. Est quadam prodire tenne] Horace
is probably indulging a little irony at the
expense of the philosophers in the implied
compar-ison of their perceptions and powers
with those of Lynceus and Glycon, and in
the humble tone he takes towards them.
‘Tenum’ as a general rule, takes the ab·
lative of the singular, and is so used in
the compound words ‘ haetenus: ‘ eatenus‚’
&c- The form ‘ quadamtenus' is used oc-
casionally by Pliny, as Bentley has shown,
and the feminine gender appears in all the
combinat-,iona of ‘ tenus’ with prononnS.
All the early editions had ‘quoddam' or
‘quodam’ till Lambinus introduced ‘ qua-
dam ’ on his own conjecture. Cruquius af-
terwards found it in his oldest Blandinian
MS. and adopted it. 'l'hc two oldest of

ted with ‘arcere’

Pottier's Parisian MSS. have ‘quadam‚’
and that was the first reading of Orelli's
St. Gallen. In all other MSS. the reading
has been ‘ quoddam ’ or ⁴ quodam? Fen is
certainly wrong in reading ‘quoddam.’
‘Fervet . . . pectus? ‘if your bosom,’
. The indicative is osten thus used
hypothetically]
34. Sunt verba et voces] Compare Eu·
ripidcs (Hippol. 478) :—

εἶσὶν δ’ ἐπῳδαὶ καὶ λόγοι θελκτήριον
φανήσεταί τι τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσυν.

The charms Horace means are the pre-
cepts of the wise derived from books (37).
He also calls them ‘piacula' (36), which
is equivalent to ‘medicamenta,’ because
disease being attributed to the wrath of
the gods, that which should remove their
wrath (‘ piaculum ¹) was the means of re-
moving disease. ‘ Ter' is used by way of
keeping up the religious notion (that num-
ber being commou in all religious ceremo-
nies, C. i. 28. 36 n.): ‘pure' is used in
the same connexion. The book must be
read with a pure mind, as the body must

be washed before sacrifice or libation can ,

be offered. By ‘ libello' I understand
Horace to mean any book that instructs
the mind in virtue. Obbarius says, “ Sine
dubio intelligendus est libellus expiationum
vel ritus vel ipsas formulas continens‚”
books of cbarms said to be written by
Orpheus, Musaeus, and others, which beg-
g-ars and impostors carried about for sale.
Orelli supports this notion [and Ritter,
and Kriiger]; but Ι do not find that
‘ libellus ' is any where specifically applied
to a book of chax-ms, or that such books
existed. [‘ Amator :’ ‘aliud est amatorem
esse, aliud amantem,’ Cicero, Tusc. iv. 12.
Horace alludes to what Cicero (Tusc. iv.
11) names ‘ mulierositas? Krfiger]
