HORATII FLACCI

Sincerum est nisi vas quodcunque infundis acescit.

Sperne voluptates, nocet empta dolore voluptas.

precarious support for his argument that
ΔΑΜ). 731 is the date of this Epistle.
However all this may be, Horace means
to say fomentations go a small way towards
curing the gout. Perhaps he means they
aggravato the pain. Whether such is the
fact 1 do not know. A good deal has been
said about Horace's meaning, but I see no
particular difficulty. Bentley chooses to
read ‘podagrum‚’ from ‘podager,' a word
used by Ennius (Epp. 19. 5 n.). [‘Poda-
grum ’ is in some MSS.

55. Sperne voluptates] The pursuit of
sensual pleasure is connected with the
pursuit of money, which is wanted for it.
The pursuit of money leads to envy, and
envy to wrath, so that all these pithy
sayings hang together.

58. Invidia Siculi] Horace probably
alludes to the bull of Phalaris, which, ae-
cording to Cicero, P. Scipio recovered from
Carthage and restored to the Agrigentini:
“ille nobilis taurus quem crudelissimus
omnium tyrannorum Phalaris habuisse
dicitur, quo vivos supplicii causa demit-
tere homines et subjicere flammam sole-
bat '’ (in Verr. ii. 4. 33. See alsone Off.
ii. 7). But the tyrants cf Sicily were
proverbial.

60. et mem] ‘Mens’ signifies passion,
μένος. [C. i. 16. 22, ‘compesce mentem.']
⁶ Exmens ' (formed like ‘exspes,’ ‘ excors,’
and other words) is suggested by H. Ste-
phens (Diatr. p. 118), and ‘amens' is pro-
posed by Muretus, who said he found it in
one of the Vatican MSS. which Fea does
not notice.

61. poenas—festinat] ‘ Hui-ries after
its revenge.’ So Horace uses ‘properare’
in C. iii. 24. 62, “ pecuniam Heredi pro-
peret ;” and in the next Epistle (v. 28).
It is like the Greek σπεύδειν, which takes
an accusative.

63. hune tu compesce] In general pre-
cepts emphasis may be given by the pro-
noun ‘tu‚' as in C. i. 9. 16.

64. Fingit equum] Here he goes back
to v. 40, “ sapere aude 3 Incipe.'’ For to
be wise he must learn, and put himself in
the hands of those who can teach him.
[Here Ritter supposes that Horace had in
mind the youth of Lollius who, as he says,
was now about five-and-tweuty and con-
sul, A.u.c. 733. Five years before, he was
in the Cantabrian wars (A.U.c. 728—730).
Ritter fixes the year of Lollius' death in
A.U.c. 755. Ritter, as already observed‚
supposes that Horace is writing to the
man who was consul in ΔΑΜ). 733, and
not to his son, of whose existence there is
no evidence. Some writers have given M.
Lollius a pair of sons with no other proof
of the fact than ‘Maxime Lolli: v. 1.]

65. venaticus, es qno] ‘ Catulus ’ is
awkwardly placed at the end of the sen-
tence. The practice of training dog-s by
means of stuffed animale was, 1 suppose,
common. ‘ Latro ’ governs an accusativo
here and in Epod. v. 58. On ‘militat'
see S. ii. 2. 10 n.

[68. melioribus] ‘Present your-sels to
those who are wiser: that is, to be taught.
Comp. Ep. i. 1. 48.]
