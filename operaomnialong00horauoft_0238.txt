OARMEN XXV.
auc. 724 (?).

This ode reads at first like an introduction to otte on a lai-ger scale in honour of
Augustus, but we need not suppose that such a sequel ever was composed. The occa-

sion, to judge by the enthusiasm of the language, may have been the announcement
of the taking of Alexandria A.U.c. 724.
