when yon should write. What was the use of my doing so if now you are to reproach
meuiflhnd broken myword?

(v. 26.) An officer of Lucullus’ one night while he was asleep had all his money and

equipments stolen. He became furious in consequence with himself as well as the
enxemy, and while his blood was up stoi-med and took one of the king's strongest
places full of treasnre, for which he was promoted and rewarded. About the same
time the general wanted to get possession of a certain fortress, and calling the officer
he says to him, ‘ Go, my brave friend, go where thy valour calls thee, and great shall
he thy reward! ⁸ Nay: replies the cunning man, ‘send some one who has lost his

purae!

(v. 41.) Ῑι was my lot to begin my education at Rome and to finish it at Athens. From

thence 1 was hurried off to the disastrous wars, and when Ι got my discharge at
Philippi, with my wings cropped, shorn of my inheritance, 1 was driven by my
poverty towrite verses. But now that Ι have enough, 1 should be mad past recovery
if 1 did not count my ease better than scribbling. Time is stealing every thing from
me,—mirth, love, wine, and sport, and now it is taking poetry too. Besides people’s
tastes differ so much. Yon like song, another likes iambics, a third coar-se satire.
How cun 1 please γοα 811 Ρ Then again how can 1 write among all the distractions
of the town ἲ Here a man calls me ιο be his surety ς there to quit my business and

> listen ιο his books; one man is sick on the Quirinal, another at the extremity of the
Aventina, and 1 must see them both, a pretty good distance you must allow. ⁸ Oh!
but the streets are so broad and clear you can think as γοα go along? Why there
is every sort of obstruction, contractors with their mules and portel-s, cranes swinging
stanes and beams ovet your hcnd, funerals, mad dogS, filthy swine ς 1 should like
you to make verses in such a scene as that. The poet loves retirement and the
woods ς the student who has been for years pot-ing over his books is rather awkward
in the world ς how can Ι write verses while the waves and storms of the city are
roaring about me Ρ

(v. 87.) Resides, these poets do nothing but praise one another. ‘A wonderful work 2
surely all the Muses had a hand in it 2’ How we hold up our heads and strut past
the library which is one day to have a copy of our works ! We 00th it like two

’ gladiators, and I come offan Alcaeus in his judgment, and he a Callimachus, nay a

Mimnermus if he likes, in mine. I could bear a good deal when Ι was canvassing for
applause ς 11αι now that I have retired 1 shut my ears ιο them all.

(v. 106.)'1'hough the public may laugh at bad verses, their authors are well satisfied‚ and

⁴ if you do not praise them, they will praise themselves. But 118 who would write a
ταῦ poem, must act his own censor, and cut out what is bad, even if he keeps it still
looked up at home. He will not fail to reproduce obsolete but expressive words as
well as new, · 118 will pour along like a rapid river, and enrich the land with the copious
stream of his eloquence3 pruning, smoothing‚ erasing, the result will seem as easy as
sport, like the mime who twists his limbs' 111 the dance.

(1.126) Ι had rather, says one, be looked upon as a fool, and be satisfied with my own
performances, than be ever so learned and tormented to boot. He' is like the gentleman
at Argos, who used to fancy himself sitting‘ 1n the theatre, and clapping the performers.

, Η8 was perfectly sane in other respects, and when his friends recovered him from this

mania, he bitterly complained that they had taken away his pleasant illusiou.

(v. 140.) But, aster all, the best thing is to put away child's play and poetry, and take
to philosophy. Therefore 1 reason with myself thus: “ If you hada sever in your veins
you would speak to the physician. But if the more γοα have, the more you want, will
you keep that to yourself Ρ If you found a particular remedy did γοα 110 good, you
would avoid that remedy. Well, you have heard men say that if a man bad money he
had wisdom ι but if γοα find yourself no wiser now you are richer, will you stick tc
