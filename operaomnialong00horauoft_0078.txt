OARMEN XVI.

The poet Stesichorus as the story goes, lost his eyesight as a punishment for a poem
in which he appears to have repeated the ordinary stories against Helen, and did not
recover it till he had written another poem recanting his opprobrious verses. Of this
παλινῳδία, which is referred to 111 Epod. xvii. 42, and which was very familiar to the
ancients, Plato has preserved the opening verses in the Phaedrus, p. 243, A. It begins
thus :—

οὗκ ἔστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος·
οὐδ’ ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοις,
οὐδ’ ἵκεο Πέργαμα Τροίας. (29 Bergk.)

This poem had a plain purpose with which the ode before us has nothing in common.
Nevertheless it has been generally supposed till of late years to be an imitation of Stesi-
chorus, and some of the grammarians have prefixed to the ode the title “Ad Tyndaridem,''
no doubt under the same impression. The foundation of this opinion appears to have
been the statement of Acron: “ Hanc oden in satisfactionem facit amicae suae, imitatus
Stesichorum poetam Siculum qui vituperationem scribens Helenae caecatus est et postea
responso Apollinis laudem ejus scripsit et oculorum aspectum reoepit.'’ He does not·
therefore say that Horace imitated the ode of Stesichorus, but only his example. It is
very probable, as Buttmann suggests, they got the name from the next ode and put it
before this, which contains no name nor any clue to the person addressed. Some MSS.
have the inscription “ Palinodia Gratidiae ad Tyndaridem,'' and whoever invented this
inscription must have supposed the ode to have been addressed to the daughter of that
woman, whom he lampoons in his Epodes. Cruquius’ Scholiast affirms that it is ad-
dressed to that person herself, and there are many who follow this view of the case,
among others Heindorf on S. i. 8. Franke is decidedly of that opinion, and supposes
this ode to have been written about the same time with Epod. xvii„ and for the same
mock purpose. I think there can be little doubt 111 the mind of any one who reads this
poem, that it was composed (though not in seriousness) with reference to some verses
Horace had actually written, and that it is not a mere translation of Stesichorus' or any
other poem, while at the same time there are Greek ideas in it, which he bon-owed
from that or some other source. Beyond this Ι am not bold enough to go.

ARGUMENT.

Lovel y daughter of a lovely mother, destroy those libellous verses how thou wilt. Cybele,
Apollo, Liber agitate not their votaries' hearts as anger dooe, which is stopped neither
by sword, nor by waves, nor fire, nor by the falling of the skies themselves. When Pro-
metheus was bidden to take a part from every animal to give to man, he implanted in our
hcarts the lion’s fury. Wrath laid Thyestes low, and bath brought proud cities to
