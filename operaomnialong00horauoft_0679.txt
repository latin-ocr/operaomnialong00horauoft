Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos,

Qua ratione qums traducem leniter aevum;
Num te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,
Num pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes5

Virtutem doctrina paret naturane donet;

Quid minuat curas, quid te tibi reddat amicum ;
Quid pure tranquillet, honos an dulce lucellum,
An secretum iter et fallentis semita vitae.
Me quoties reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,

and editions vary here again. The read-
ings are ‘num,' ‘non,’ ‘ne,' and ‘nec.’

‘ne,’ which is the reading of most of the
editions of the sixteenth century, and of

things of small value? Some critics sup-

‘indifferentia,' as Cicero trans-

lm.. Virtutem doctrina paret] Whe-
thu· virtue is a science (ἐπιστήμη) and
capable of being taught (διδακτή) 10 dis-
caused by Socrates in Plato’s dialogue
Menon. He held that virtue consists 111
tho 00101100 ofgood3 that to bevirtuous we
must know what is for we must do
what is guod because we know it to be
good, or there is no virtue in doing it.
He held 11101 we have a moral sense by
which good is ρει-0011011, but the moral
sense, like other faculties, requires to be
011-11οε111011οᾱ and assisted by instruction,
and to that extent virtue is διδακτή.
Practically this appears to have been 1110
doctrine of Socrates. It is expressed in
the Memorabilia, in ii. 6. 39: ὅσαι δ’ ἐν
am..2‘’.ZZ“² ,1ὲὲἷὲἔῖ ‘'2’. tffl'ffss‘izg
αὐξανομένας. Comp. iii. 9. 1, and iv. 1. 3.
Antisthenes and the Cynics held the same
opinion, 111 1110 following out of which
Socrates himself was led into some contra-
dictiona. 'nne question was a common

rhetorical theme in Horace’s day: hence
Cicero mentions it with other kindred
topics in his treatise ‘Pax-titiones Orato-
riae: c. 18: “ ut cum quaeritur quemad-
modum quidque fiat; ut quonam pacto
virtus pariatur, naturane 00 ratione an
usu.’'

103. fallentis semita vitae] See Ep.
17. 10 0., and compare Juvenal (x. 363):
“semita certe Tranquillas per virtutem
patet unica vitae.”

104. gelidus Digentia rivus] The Di-
gentia (Licenza) was 0 mall stream which,

pas- rising near Horace's house (Ep. 16. 12 0.),

after a course of about six miles, emptied
itself into the Anio. De Cbaupy (iii. 156)
says with reference to the epithet ‘geli-
dus :' “ Ses eaux tirent de leur origine une
sraicheur qn’elles conservent dans une
vallee aussi close, et que l'air plus libre
qn'elles trouvent apres elle n'est capable
que d’augmenter.” There is 0 village
called Bardela, which probably stands on
the site of Mandela. It is at the foot of
Monte Cantalupo, at the head of the valley
of hiesum, and on the banks of the stream
which separates it from Vico Varo (Varia,
Ep. 14. 3). Walckenaer (nist. p. 412)
says it 10 about four and two-thirds Roman
101100 west of Licenza, which he identifies
with Ustica (C. i. 17. 11). De Chanpy
places it about the same distance. He
explains from his own observation how,
through its position at the head of the
valley, and the winds that blow upon it
from the north-east, it was colder 111011
Horace’s residence higher up the valby,
by way of reconciling the description ‘ ru-
gosus frigore ' with ‘temperiem
laudes’ in Ep. 16. 8. He gives a sepul-
chral inscription, of date not earlier than
the establishment of Christianity, dug up
in the last century, near Bardela. It
marked a tomb which some person had
erec-ted over the remains of his wife aud
daughter, “m rmnns sms iussu
