Quamque poetarum seniorum turba; sed ille,

Si foret hoc nostrum fato dilatus in aevum,

Detereret sibi multa, recideret omne quod ultra

Perfectum traheretur, et in versu faciendo 70
Saepe caput scaberet 'vivos et roderet ungues,

Saepe stilum vertas iterum quae digna legi sint

scripturus, neque te ut miretur turba labores,

Contentus paucis lectoribus.

think that the ‘rudis carminis auctor' is

' some earlier t than Lucilius, whoever

tis also doubtful who are

the poete whom Horace alludes to in
‘poetarum seniorum turba-³ Some sup-

other hand it· is in favour of Macleane' s
interpretation, that ‘Graecis intacti car-
minis anctor’ seems to be an allusion to
Roman satire, of which Lucilius is named
the father] Horace means to say that
Lucilius, from the novelty of his style, may
pomibly be judged unfairly, and may pos-
sess more beauties and even elegancies than
are allowed him3 but still there ean be no
doubt, if he had lived to that time, he
would have corrected many expressions and
gone to a good deal oftrouble in polishing
his verses. The oommentators have given
a variety of interpretations from the
Scholiasta downwards, which Orelli has
collected. The above agrees with Hein-
ἀοι-ΡΒ explanation, and is the substance of
a paper on the subject by C. F. Hermann,
which Orelli quotes with approbation.

'nie MSS. and editions vary
‘dilatus' and ‘delatus-3 ‘dilapsus’ and
‘delapsum' The first is more generally
adopted. It means properly ‘deferred‚’
hadhisbirthbeen put off till now. ‘De-
latus’ would mean, phad his life been con-
tinued, bmnght down to the present time.

[69. Deles-eret] A metaphor derived
from the file (lima), ‘recideretss a meta·

cabile vulnus ense recidendum,’ Ovid. Met.
i. 190). ‘Ultra perfectum? that which is

⁷2. Saepe etiium vertas] ‘Stilum ver-
tere’ was the phrase for erasing what had
been written, one end of the iron pen

(stilus) being broad for the purpose of
obliterating the letters made upon the wax
tablet by the sharp end, which they called

‘acumem' [Cic. de Or. i. c. 33. Comp- Cic.
Ver-r. ii. 2. 41.]

75. Vilibus in ludis] Such schools as
Flavius’ perhaps, if poetry was ever taught
there, or 1ιι those cheap schools in the back
streets mentioned in Epp. i. 20. 18. The
word‘ dictari' refers to the practice of the
teacher reading out a for the pupil
to repeat aster him, one of the earliest
steps' ιιι peneducation being accurate pronun-
ciation. This is whatg Macrobius means
when speaking of Virgil he aska‘ ‘nunc
quia cmn Marone nobis negotium est, re-
spondeas volo utrum poetae hujus opera
instituendis tantum pueris idonea judices,
an alia illis altiora' inesse fatearis. Videris
enim mihi ita adhuc Vergilianos habere
versus qualiter eos pueri magistris praele-

gentibus canebamus’' (Saturn. i. 24).

alsoMartiall. 36:

“Versus scribere me parum severos,
Nec quos praelegat. ιιι schola magister,
Corneli, quereris?

Orelli explains‘ dictari’ here of the boy
repeating what he has learnt, and in Epp.
ii. 1. 71, where it is obviously said of the
toacher, he explains it of‘his repeating the
words to be taken down by the scholar and
then got by beart. Comm. Cruq. aud
many of the editors understand it here of
the master. The words ‘ canere,' ‘ cau-
tare: which are frequently applied to the
recitation of the pupss, show that the mo-
dulation of the voice was a primary consi-
deration in teaehing. To help this 1 have
no doubt was one principal purpose of the
master’s reciting to his scholars, which
was done quite at the beginning, and pro-
bably before the boy s could write; whence
Horace says (Epp. ii. 1. 126)st ‘Os tene·
rum pueri balbumque po'e'ta figurat? It
was a good preparation for their subae-

queut training under the teacher of
rhetoric.
