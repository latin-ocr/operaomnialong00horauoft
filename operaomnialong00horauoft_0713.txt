Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis
Rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.

Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt

Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo
Splendida facta linunt. Idem rex ille poema
Qui tam ridiculumtam care prodigus emit,
Edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellen

Pingeret, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera
Fortis Alexandri vultum simulantia.

Ad libros et ad haec Musarum dona vocares,
Boeotum in crasso jurares acre natum.

233. onon-ihs] Choerilus of Iasos, ac·
cording to Acron, was “poeta qui Alex-
andrmnffignum secutus bella ejusdem
descripsit: cui Alexander dixisse fertur
malle se Thersitem Homeri esse quam
hujus Achillem.’' He adds: “ Choerilus
Alexandri poeta depactus est cum eo ut
nivel-sum bonum faceret aureo numismate

(hilaret-ur, si malum colaphis feriretur3

qui nepeinale dicendo colaphis nectus est?
This poet has been consounded with a
native of Samos, who wrote an epic
σιι the Persian wars of Darius and

erxes. He is mentioned again A. P. 357.

‘Halenatis versibus? [‘ neqnearte neque
natm bonos versus facientem? Po rphy-
riou. ‘Versibus’ isthe dative dependent on

‘rettulit accepto& S. ii. 3. 69n.]means
veraesmade bya poet who was not born
such, seeing that ‘poeta- nascitur non fit?

‘Philippi' were gold coins with Philip's
head οιι them. the Macedonian‘ stater: of
which many ens are in existence.
The value' is reckoned at ll. 3⁸. ed. of our
money. (See Dict. Ant.)

236. Δίνωπιειιία] Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 6,
25) gives au account of the way in which
ink wasmade by the ancients. The Greeks
called it μέλαν, the Romans‘ atramentum
scriptorium: or ‘librariumss to distingm sh
it from shoemaker’s dy e, also called ‘imtra-
mentum? aud a paint ywhich had the same
name. See Dict. Ant. Horace says it is
a common thing for poets to defile great
deeds with bad verses, as the fingeis are
defiled when they handle ink.

239. ne qais ee praeter Apellen] A pelles
painted during the latter half of the fourth
century B.c. at the court of Philip, and ιιι
the camp of Alexander This story is re·
fen-ed to pyb Cicero' ιιι his letter to Lucceius
(ad Pam. v. 12. 7· ‘Neque enim Alex-

ander ille gratiae causa ab Apelle potissi-

mum pingi et a Lysippo fingi volebat ; sed

quod illorum artem cum ipsis tum etiam
sibi gloriae fore putabat.” See also Pliny
(vii. 37) and Plutarch (Alex. c. 4). His
reputation aa a painter stood higher than
that of any other ancient painter. His
most celebrated painting was that of Aphro-
dite rising from the sea, which was placed
by Augustus in the temple of C. Julius
Caoear.

Lysippus was a younger contemporary
of Apelles, and a native of Sicyon. He
unu-ought almost entirely in bronze. [See
Sillig, Catalogns Artificum, Apelles and
Lysippus] Plutarch (de Fort. et Virt.
Alex. ii. 2) says ἣν δὲ καὶ Ἀπελλῆς ὁ
ζωγράφος καὶ Λύσιππος ὁ πλάστης κατ’
Ἀλέξανδρον· ων ὁ μὲν ἔγραψε τὸν κεραυνό-
φορον οὕτως ἐναργῶς καὶ κεκραμένως ὥστε
λέγειν, ὅτι δνοῖν Ἀλεξάνδρον ὁ μὲν §mtr-
πον γέγονεν ἀνίκητος, ὁ δὲ Ἀπελλοῦ ἀμίμη-
τος. And of Lysippus he says ε Λυσίππου
δὲ τὸ πρῶτον Ἀλέξανδρον πλάσαντος ἄνω
βλέποντα τᾷ προσώπῳ πρὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν
(dvm-ep αὐτὸς εἰώθει βλέπειν Ἀλέξανδρος
ησυχῆ παρεγκλίνων τὸν τράχηλον) ἐπέ-
γραψέ τις οὐκ ἀπιθάνως,-

αυδασοῦντι δ’ ἔοικεν ό χάλκεος εἷς Δία
λεύσσων·
’γᾶν ὑπ’ ἐμοὶ τίθεμαι, Ζεῦ σὺ δ’ Ὄλυμπον
εχε.

He also says that Alexander ordered that
Lysippus alone should make his statues,
because he was the only artist who repre-
sented his character, and while adher-ing
to his features did not fail to bring ont his
virtues. [‘ Alius Lysippo? ‘any other
than Lysippus. ’ See Epp. i. 16. 20.]
244. Boeotum m craeso] Respecting the
proverbial dulness aud sensuality of the
Boeotians, which Polybius said was un·
paralleled ιιι Grecian history, see Thirlwall
