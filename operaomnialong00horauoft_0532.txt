HORATII FLAC CI

Ignarum quibus est jus aptius et quibus assis ’
Languidus in cubitum jam se conviva reponet.

Umber et iligna nutritus glande rotundas

,40⁴

Curvat aper lances carnem vitantis inertem ;

Nam Laurens malus est, ulvis et arundine pinguis.
Vinea submittit capreas non semper edules.
Fecundae leporis sapiens sectabitur armos,

Piscibus atque avibus quae natura et foret aetas

Lambinus ‘averrit.' Lambinus has a par-
tiality for that word, which he introduces
for ‘ avertere ' here, though from the
Scholiasts downwards the latter word had
appeared in all the commentaries and
editions. Torrentius», though he edits
‘avertere,’ prefers ‘averrere‚’ which he
interprets sweeping the board as 1151181·-
men sweep the sea with their 11815, (See
S. 3. 235.) Cruquius, though he follows
the received reading, says that all his
MSS. but one inferior to the rest had
‘ averrere,' and Bentley adopts and defends
that reading, but ,in a new sense, contrary
to the meaning of the passage. ‘ Averrere ’
is not used by any classical author; but
” that does not prove any thing. It appears
in all the oldest Parisian· MSS. In many
of the later oues ‘ avertere ' appears as it
does in Orelli's Berne and St. Gallen MSS.
and in most of Fea’s. It is not certain
which Horace wrote, but Ι prefer ‘aver-
tere‚’ in the plain sense of carrying off.
[Ritter has ‘ averrere.'] ‘ Mensa’ is osten
used for the count-er of the ‘ argentariuS,'
but nowhere else in the sense it has here.
On ‘ pisces patinarii' (‘quibus jus est ap-
tius ³) and ‘ assi’ see S. i. 3. 81 11.

39. Languidus in cubitum] Catius says
it is of no use for a man to buy expensive
fish if he does not know how to dress
them, that is, which should be served up
with sance, aud which when fried will
tempt the guest, after he has laid himself
down tired of eating‚ to raise himself 011
his elbow and begin eating again.

41. Currat aper] On ⁵ aper’ see above,
S. 3. 234. The great majority of MSS. and
editions have ‘ curvat.² Bentley, rather
perversely, considering that he acknow-
ledges the matter is indifferent, reads ‘cur-
vet' on little authority. The same confu-
sion between the indicative and imperative
is found in C. iii. 19. 11, “ tribus aut novem
miscentur cyathis,” where some MSS.
and editions have ‘miscentorss (See note.)

43. Vinea submittit] He says that the
flesh of wild deer fed in vineyards is not
always eatable. I confess Ι do not under-
stand what he means. How the ‘caprea‚’

45

a mountain goat, chamois, οι· some one of
the deer kind, should be habitually fed in
vineyardS, as the verse seems to imply‚ is
unintelligible to me. There is no varia-
tion in the MSS. ‘ capreoli? and some say
‘capreae' (see Forcell. sub. v.), were
shoots of the vine. But that sense has
no place here as the verse stands. ‘ Sub-
mittit ' is equivalent to ‘ suppeditat‚’ ‘ sup-
plies? See C. iv. 4. 63: “Monstrnmve
submisere Colchi.'' Heindorf quotes Lu-
can (iv. 410): “Non pabula tellus Pas-
cendis submittit equis.”

44. Fecundae leporis] The ancients had
odd notions about the hare (which Sir
Thomas Browne has handled with his
usual learning and gravity, Vulgm- Error-s,
Book iii. c. 17), that it was of both sexes,
and that it was always with young, and
brought forth two or three every mouth.
See Pliny (x. 63): “Dasypodes omni
mense pariunt et superfetant, sicut le·
pores.” Herodotus mentions the same
circumstance (iii. 108), ὁ λέγω-οὔτω δή
τι πολύγονόν ἐστι,“ ἐπικυΐσκεται μυΰνον
πάντων θηρίων· and Aristotle the same
(Hist. An. vi. 33), οἱ δὲ δασύποδες ὀχεύ-
ονται καὶ τίκτουσι πᾶσαν ὤραν καὶ ἐπι-
κυΐσκηντιιι ὅταν κύωσι, καὶ τίκτουσι κατὰ
μῆνα. Τ118 superfetation of the hare and
rabbit is a'n admitted fact. The Scho-
liasts and all the old 8111ιί005, and the

edited ‘ fecundae? which appeared in his
oldest Blandinian MS. Bentley adopted
the reading, and most modern editors
have done the same. Lepus is nowhere
else used in the feminine gender, but
I believe it might be in such a case as
this, and Priscian (p. 658, quoted by
Bentley) says it is of common gender.
Orelli’s St. Gallen MS. has ‘fecundae’
and that editor adopts it, as he does ‘ albae ’
with ‘ anseris' in S. 8. 88. Either Ι think
would do. A modern epicure would not
choose the shoulder of a hare as the most
delicate part. Itis so distinguished again
