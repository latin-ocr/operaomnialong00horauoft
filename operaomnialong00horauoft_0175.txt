GARMEN Π.

About A.u.c. 728.

In addition to the general argument noticed before, Pranke discovers in verses 19, 20,
an indication of the date of this ode, suppoeing Horace to allude to Augustus’ expressed

v intention of hying down his power in A.U.c. 726. I do not see any necessary connexion.

Thepurpose of thie ode is to commend public and social virtue, and the opening
ulmus that it ia a continuation of the preceding ode.

” ARGUMEXT.

contemnent is to be learned in arms aud danger. To die sor our country is glorious,
'and death pursues the coward. Virtne is superior to popular fax our οι· rejection, and
opens the way to the skiae, and rises above the dull atinosphere of this world. Good
saith too has its reward, and 1 would ιιοι be the companion of the mun who neglecta

it, lest Ι share his sure reward.
