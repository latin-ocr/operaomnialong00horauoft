HORATII FLACCI

Perduei poterit tam frugi tamque pudica,
Quam nequiere proci recto depellere cursu ?’'
“Venit enim magnum donandi parca juventuS‚

Nec tantum veneris quantum studiosa culinae.

Sic tibi Penelope frugi est, quae si semel uno

De sene gustarit tecum partita lucellum,

Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto.

Me sene quod dicam factum est: anus improba Thebis

Ex testamento sie est elata: cadaver

Unctum oleo largo nudis humeris tulit heres,

Scilicet elabi si posset mortua 3

“Apage istum a me perductorem; nihil
moror ductarier3

Quiquid est errabo potius qnam per·

ductet quispiam.''

The words ‘ frugi ' and ‘frugalitas' Cicero
(Tusc. Disp. iii. 8) derives from ‘fruge,'
because it is the best thing the earth pro-
duces: a bad reason even if the etymology
be right. He gives the word a wide mean-
ing : “tres virtutes, fortitudinem, justi-
tiam, prudentiam, frugalitas est complexa.
—Ejus videtui· esse proprium motus animi
appetentes regere et sedare semperque ad-
versantem libidini moderatam in omni re
servare constantiam? The Greek σώφρων
corresponds to ‘frugi‚' according to this
definition, though Cicero limits its mean-
ing as much as he extends ‘ frugi.’ ‘ Dis-
creet' is the nearest English word perhaps
corresponding to ‘ frugi?

79. maynum donandi parca] The suitors
are once only mentioned as offering pre-
sents to Penelope, and their value was not
great. (Odyss. xviii. 290 sqq.) They were
offered in consequence of the taunts of
Penelope herself.—[‘ Venit enim :’ ‘ Well,
and the reason is that suitors came who
were sparing in making large presents.’
If the common translation ‘for' (enim)
is used, the reader must supply, ‘I grant
you‚' or the like.]

80. studiosa culinae] This corresponds
with Homer-’s description. See, among

Α other places, Odyss. ii. 55, where Tele·

machus complains of the suitors thus:

οἱ δ’ εἷς ἡμέτερον πωλεύμενοι ἤματα
πάντα

βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄῖς καὶ πίονας αἶ’γας

εἰλαπινάζουσιν, πίνουσί τε αἴθοπα οἵνον

μαψιδίως.

81. Sic tihi Penelope frugi est, quae]
‘Sic' means ‘to that extent 3' that is,
provided she luas no great temptation:

oredo

but if she once gets a taste of any old
man's money she will be chaste no longer.
The proverb that follows is Greek. Theo-
critus has it (x. 11) μηδέ γε συμβαίη·
χαλεπὸν χορίω κύνα γεῦσαι.

84. anus improba Thebis] ‘Improba’ -
seems to mean ‘sly,’ which we too call
‘ wicked? See S. 1. 9. 73.

87. Scilicet elabi si posset] ‘Of course
it was to see whether she could escape
from him when dead,’ or ‘in hopes that
she might? We are to suppose, as Oomm.
Cruq. says, she had made it a condition in
her will that if he did not carry her with·
out letting her drop, he was to forfeit
the inheritance. [Ritter says, if she had
intended this, she might have lest him
by her testament nothing ‘nisi plum-e ς’
and he adds, ‘non testamento excidere
hominem, sed captatorem civium suorum
oculis denotare voluit.’ But the old
woman would not have had her revenge
by simply omitting the man in her will ς
and unless the loss of the inheritance fol-
lowed the failure of complying with the
condition, the man would have the in-
heritanee, and that was not what the old
woman intended] Of this story Esne
says (p. 555) : “ quin Romae Horatii tem-
pore acciderit mihi dubiam non esse vide·
tur.” Orelli thinks· it is taken from some
‘mimus‚’ and considers it an incredible
story. It is certainly very strange. ‘ Sci-
licet’ is in reality a verb, and significa

compare the example there quoted from
Caesar. “ Hostes circumfunduntur ex
omnibus partibus si quem aditum reperire
possint '' (Bell. Gall. vi. 37). Fea quotes
some Vatican MSS. that have ‘ sie:
and the oldest Blandinian has ‘ut sic,'
whereby the authority of that MS. is
much damaged.
