Inter mariti vina, neque eligit
Cui donet impermissa raptim
Gaudia luminibus remotis 5
Sed jussa eoram non sine conscio

Surgit marito, seu vocat institor

Seu navis Hispanae magister,
Dedecorum pretiosus emptor.
Non his juventus orta parentibus
Infecit aequor sanguine Punico,

Pyrrhumque et ingentem cecidit ’

Antiochum Hannibalemque dirum 3

the expression is a legitimate one, and the
word ‘frangitur’ comes nearer to the Greek
of Aristophanes (Thesm. 163), which it is
not improbable Horace may have had in
mind. Speaking of the combination of
music and poetry, he says of the great lyric
' poets that they ἐμιτροφόρουν τε καὶ διε-
κλῶντ’ ’Ῑωνικῶς.-1“)ιὶηοὶῃς was taught by
slaves, Pantomimi, whom Ovid (A. A. iii.
351) calls “artifices lateris, scenae specta-
cula.;'’ and Seneca says “juvenes mancipia
pantomimorum '³ (Ep. 47). Tiberius passed
a deeree that they should never appear in

public except on the stage (Tae. Ann. i. 7 7 )‚'

which explains Ovid.
23. Jam nunc] The meaning of ‘jam
nunc' is sufficiently marked in A. P. 43:

“ Ordinis haec virtus erit et Venus, aut ego
fallor,
Ut jam nunc dicat jam nune debentia
dici.”

‘Nunc’ is ‘n0w‚' and ‘jam' gives intensive
force to ‘nune.' ‘Jam jamque' expresses
‘what is expected every moment' (Key,
L. G. 1450, e.), but has not happened yet.
The eommentators mix up ‘jam nunc' and
‘jam jam‚' as if they were synonymous.
So Orelli, on C. ii. 1. 17, explains ‘jam
nunc minaci‚’ &c.‚ thus ‘⁶ fingit se jamjam
vel ante lectam Asinii curam in medias res
abreptum esse.’' Horace says as soon as
a girl has grown up she is trained by lasci-
vious teaching and turns her thoughts to
unchaste pleasures. The expression ‘de
tenero ungui’ is taken from the Greek ἐξ
ἁπαλῶν ὀνύχων, which signifies ‘from ten-
der years,’ when the nails are delicate, and
such is the meaning here 3 but it does not
contradict ‘matura’ as some suppose: the
expression will apply to a girl in the ear-
liest stage of womanhood. I do not follow
Orelli’s punctuation. Cicero, in his letter

to Lentulus (i. 6), says, “ praesta te eum
qui mihi a teneris ut Graeci dicunt ungui-
culis es cognitus.'’ The Greeks appear from
Cicero's statement to have used the 'phrase
proverbially, but it is only found in
an Epigrain of Automedon in the Antho-
logy (ΒΓ. ii. 207), in which the writer pro-
bably had regard to Horace’s ode, as Mitseh.
observes:

τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσίης ὀρχηστρίδα, τὴν κακο-
τέχνοις ·
σχήμασιν ἐξ ἆπαλῶν κινυμένην ὀνύχων,
αἰνέω οὐχ ὅτι πάντα παθαίνεται, υύδ’ ὅτι

βάλλει

τὰς ἁπαλὰς ἁπαλῶς ὧδε καὶ ὧδε χέρας.

26. Inter-vina] See Epp. i. ¹7. 28 ; ‘ad
vina ’ in C. iv 5. 31.

27. impermissa] This word occurs no-
where else. ‘Intermissa’ and ‘improvisa’
have thus got into some MSS. in place of
the true reading. ‘Inconcessus' is used
by Virgil and ovid, and Horace uses ‘ inter-
dicta? Orelli (third edu. by Baiter) here
treats ‘intermissa' as ‘interpolatio ε’ but
in his V. L„ on iv. 7. 10, where ‘imperi-
tura’ has got into one of his MSS. for
‘interitura,’ he says this makes it very
doubtful whether the true reading here is
‘impermissa.’

29. Sed jussa coram] 'rhe connivance
of the husband at the wickedness of the
wife is touched by Juvenal in his first
Satire (56 sqq.). Metals appear to have
been the chief articles imported from Spain,
with red lead and those stones which were
polished into mirrors, whatever stones those
may have been. See Plin. N. H. iii. 3.

32. Dedecorum] Forcellini gives no
other instance of ‘pretiosus’ in an active
sense, ‘one who gives a large price?
Ulpian’s definition of ⁴ magister-² is this:
“Magistrum navis accipere debemus cui‘
