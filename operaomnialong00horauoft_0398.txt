wrong, he would say, “Can you doubt about its impropriety when you see the (115-
grace it has brought upon so and so? As the intemperate are ehecked by seeing
their neighbour carried to the grave, so young persons are often kept from crime by

the shame it brings upon others.”

Such was the traiuing that has made me what I

am, free from grave faults‚ if not from venial, and even these will diminish with
time and reflection, which 1 praetise every day. WVhen I have leisure I put my
thoughts into wrsting, which is one of my little sins ς for which sin, if you will not
. make allowanee, 1 shall bring all my paek to help me, and we shall make a convert

of you whether you will or no.

Euroms atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poeitae,

Atque alii quorum comoedia prisca virorum est,

Si quis erat dignus describi quod malus ac fur,

Quod moechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui

Famosus, multa cum libertate notabant. 5

Τ110 vigour and boldness of Cratinus'
writings are described by Aristophanes
(Knights, 526 sqq, aud elsewhere), who
was seventy- -five years his junior, as it 15
501(1, though they were rivals the year
before Cratinus' death, B.0. 423, when he
won the first prize, and Aristophanes the
third with the clouds. The satire of Eu-
polis was also very unsparing‚ as we leam
as well from other notiees as from the
story (true or false) that Alcibiades had
him thrown overboard at sea for lampoon-
ing him. The other writers of the Old
Comedy, whom Horace alludes to wit-h re-
spect, are very little known to us. Their
names, with those of the writers of the
Middle and New Comedy, are in Clinton

106—114). The distinction was 11110111οᾶ
by the Alexandline grammarians. The
old ended with Aristophanes, The middle
was -supported chiefly by Eubulus, Anti-
phanes, Anaxandrides, and Alexis, and
lasted over about fifty years of the fourth
century Β. c. Of the N ew Comedy, which
the Romans imitated, the principal writers
were Philemon, Menander, Diphilus (Prol.
Adelphi), and PosidippuS‚ who was the
last of the Greek comic- poets, and died

about 1³.c. 230. Schlegel (Di-am. Lit.
Leet. vii.) denies the existence of 0 Middle
Comedy, with which question we are not
concerned here, but we need only observe
that Horace fixes on the Comoedia Prisca,
because the subsequent phases of the
Greek Comic Drama were not of the 501110
personally satirical cast, the licence granted
to the old writers having been taken away
by law. The New Comedy was like our
own, using the language of daily life to
show in 011 amusing way the manners of
the day, the follies of society, and the
lighter infirmities of human 11011110, while
the old dealt in invectivas against social,
political‚ or individual vices dressed up in
grotesque language and images. It is to the
language of 1110 New Comedy that Horace
refers' 111 this Satire, when he puts the ques

Between his own writings and the Old

words ‘poetae' and ‘virorum’ are used

(de Re Publica iv. 10) says that to the
Greeks “ fuit etiam lege concessum ut

during the period of the Old Comedy, the
law did not interfere with this liberty.
