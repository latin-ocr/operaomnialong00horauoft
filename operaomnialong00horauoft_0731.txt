EPISTOLARUM H. 2.

Dives et importunus ad umbram lucis ab ortu
Silvestrem flammis et ferro mitiget agrum,
Scit Genius, natale comes qui temperat astrum,
Naturae deus humanae, mortalis in unum
Quodque eaput, vultu mutabilis, albus et ater:
Utar et ex modico quantum res poscet acervo
Tollam, nec metuam quid de me judicet heres,
Quod non plura datis invenerit3 et tamen idem
Scire volam quantum simplex hilarisque nepoti
Discrepet et quantum discordet parcus avaro.
Distat enim spargas tua prodigus an neque sumptum
Invitus facias neque plura parare labores,
Ae potius, puer ut festis Quinquatribus olim,
Exiguo gratoque fruaris tempore raptim.
Pauperies immunda domus procul absit. ego, utrum
Nave ferar magna an parva, ferar unus et idem.
Non agimur tumidis velis aquilone 888111111ος
Νο11 tamen adversis aetatem ducimus austris,
Viribus, ingenio, specie, virtute, loco, re,
Extremi primorum, extremis usque priores.

- Non es avarus: abi ς quid, caetera jam simul isto
