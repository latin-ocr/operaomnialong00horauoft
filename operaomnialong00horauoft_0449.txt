travagance Priapus foretells they will come
to a pauper-’s funeral. We need not under-
stand them a‘s already dead and buried iu
the Bquiliae, as Comm. Cruq. says.

12. tnaepaioe in fronte] This public
“ was 1000 feet in breadth and

min depth. ‘In fronte’ means facing the
publio mad, the Via Tiburtina (S. 6. 108),
mauvia Praenestina, one of which, οι·
heth, must have passed very close to it.
(8oe Caesar, B. G. ii. 8, and ΜΓ. Iaoug's
me.) It was usual to engrave on mouu-
hmts the following letters, Η. x. Η. x. s.
which md for “ Hoc monumentum

ufunlength. Sometimes ΒΧ ⁹1⁸. (ex tes·
tamento) were inserted between ιι. and rt.
Inmbinus has given four inscriptions,
copied by himself, stom ancient sepulchres,
, ofwhieh the following he found in Rome :

nr aaa. mna. The others are of like
impert ς that is to say, they specify for
whose particular use the sepulchre was
built, and provide against its going, with
the rest of the man's property, to his he-
redes. Horace writes as if there were a
stone (cippus) set up on some part of the
boundary of this burial-ground, with the
inscription usual on private monuments,
π. lt. Η. Π. 8., which is obviously only a
aare. The words could only apply to a
private place of burial. An he really means
1⁸, that a space of ground of the extent he
mentions was marked off for the burial of
these poor people. For other examples of
such insu-iptions, see Fabretti Insc. Antiq.

&o.,Explic. Romae, 1699. [Ritteralsotakes
the words ‘ Heredeg’ dcc„ as added by the
poet in johe. Acron’s interpretation is,
that some unknown person had gIven the
land for public use; which ean hardly bc
true. It was given by the city probably, and
if so, the words ‘ Heredes, dte„ have no

nor e sa ire.

14. Nunc liget Esquiliis] The whole of
the Esquiline or fifth region of Rome, was
called Esquiliae, and from having been an

nius tells us that Augustus, when he was
ill, went to Maecenas' house in the Esqui-
liae to recruit (Octav. c. 72). 'Ibe ‘agger'
here referred to was a raised teri-ace com-
meneed by Servius Tullius, and mrried by
him from the Porta Collina to the Porta

uilina. It was continued (according
to mer, who quotes Dion. Halic. iv. 54)
by Tarquinius Superbus as far as the Porta
Querquetulana, being in all about twelve
stadia, and about fisty feet in breadth. It
thus skirted on the east the whole of the
fisth or Esquiline quarter, and the sixth,
which had its name Alta Semita from this
great work. Here the Romans walked in
oold weatherto get the sun, and had a full
view of the pestilent plain which Maecenas
eonverted into a paradise. Juvenal calls it
‘ ventosus ’ (S. viii. 43). Bentley edits
‘qua’ in v. 15, and is followed by some
editors ε but it is against all the MSS. and
older editions, and ‘quo,' in the sense of
‘ex quo,' will do very well. [Ritter takes
‘ quo ' as equivalent to ‘ in quo,']

17. eum mihi nou tantum] ‘ Cum ⁹ is
thus connected with what goes before.
Priapus says the locality is now made
healthy, and the citizens may take their
walk without being sickened with the
sight of bones bleaching upon the plain,
whereas (while) his vexations still remain,
—the driving away of thieves and wild
animals which still frequented the spot, and
yet worse the punishment and sear-ing away
of the witches who there continued to carry
