HORATII FLACCI

Si non est, jurat bene solis esse maritis.

Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo ⁴?
Ride : mutat coenacula, lectos,

Quid pauper?

90

Balnea, tonsores, conducto navigio aeque
Nauseat ac locuples quem ducit priva triremis?
Si curatus inaequali tonsore capillos

90. Protea] See S. ii. 3. 71.

91. Quid pauper? Ride] “ ‘Viden ut
mutat,' Bentleius, ex conjectura inepta,”
Fea says, and so 1 think any one will say,
who reads Bentley's note. The only varia-
tion in the MSS. is ‘rides' for ‘ride.’ That
appears to have been the reading of one of
the Scholiasts (Comm. Cruq.), who says:
“ fingit Maecenatem ridere quasi praesen-
tem.” But very few MSS. have ‘1·ides,’
and those inferior.

— coenacula] All the rooms above the
ground floor were called ‘coenacula’ So
Festus says ε “ Coenacula dicuntur ad
quae scalis ascenditur.'' While the rich
lived in their own houses, poorer persons
(and it must be reinembered that ‘ pauper-
tas ' is comparative poverty, not want) took
‘'flats’ as they are called in Scotland, or
single rooms in the upper story of houses
which went by the name of ‘ insnlae‚' the
inhabitants of which were called ‘coenacu-
larii.' In such a room Vitellius lodged
his wife and children, according to Sueto-
nius (c. 7), when he was sent by Galba as a
legatus into Germania Inferior ; and Mar-
tial lived up three pair of stuirs (i. 118):
‘⁶ Scalis habito tribus sed altis.'’ Other dis-
tinguished literary men lived in garrets
then as they have since. Suetonius tells us
of Orbilius a celebrated grammarian, that
he was so lodged: “ namque jam persenex
pauperem se et habitare sub tegulis quoda-m
scripto fatetur '³ (de Illust. Gram. c. 9);
and Valerius Cato, we learn from the same
treatise (c. 10), passed-the latter years of a
long life in the same sort of abode. Sue-
tonius quotes some bitter lines of Furius
Bibaculus (S. i. 10, Exc.), in which he
describes Cato as one— “

“ Quem tres cauliculi et selibra farris,

Racemi duo tegula sub una,
Ad summam prope nutriant scnectam.’'

It seems to have been usual for annual
tenants to change their lodgings on the
Kalends of J ulv. Martia] describes the flit-
ting of a poor⁴family with all their pro-
perty, which he enumerates in an amusing
way. The Epigram (xii. 32) begins—
“ O J uliarum dedecus Kalendarum
Vidi, Vacerra, sarcinas tuas, vidi.''

(See Beck. Gall. p. 6 n. Eng. Trans.) Ho-
race speaks of persons changing from
caprice and aping the ways of the rich.
92. conducto navigio] ‘Navigium' ex-
presses the vulgar craft which the poor man
hires in imitation of the private yacht of
the rich man, as smartly built and well
found as a trireme. He hires his boat,
which he cannot afford to do, and goes
through the horrors of sea-sickness‚ that he
may have the honour of serving as a foil to
the elegance of his wealthy neighbour-
Orelli thinks it very probable Horace is
here drawing a picture of himself, as in S.
ii. 7 (note on v. 23), and he commende the
sagacity of CruquiuS, who first suggested
that notion. I see no merit in it at au.
[‘Aeque ε’ S. ii. 3. 47; ‘priva ε’ S. ii. 5.
94. Si curatus inaequali tonsore] He
taxes Maecenas with the prevailing incon-
sistcncy. A very few MSS„ including one
of Cruquius'‚ have ‘curtatus,' which that
editor, Lambinus, Torrentius, and others,
have edited. But ‘comas’ or ‘capillos
curare ' wasa common expression. Domi&
tian wrote a book ‘de cura capillorum,’
according to Suetonius (c. 18), which he
addressed to a friend who was bald like
himself. Orelli’s strange explanation of
‘inequali tonsore' being an ablative abso-
lute has been mentioned on C. i. 6. 2.
[Kriiger has made the same mistake, and
refers to Juvenal, i. 13, ‘assiduo ruptae
lectore columnae‚’ as an example of the
same construction, the ablative absolute;
which it certainly is not.] ‘Subucula'
was a second tunic worn under the ‘in-
tusium,' which was the upper tunic.
‘ Pexae ’ signifies a cloth on which the nap
was not closely shorn and was still fresh
(“ pexusque togaque recenti‚” Pers. S. i.
15). The upper tunic therefore would be
new while the under one was old and
shabby. The ‘subucula’ had sleeves,
which the ‘intusium' had not. Any dif-
ference therefore in the cloth would be
very perceptible. out of doors the toga
would conceal both, but in-doors the toga
was not worn. ‘ Intusium ’ is from ‘induo.’
‘ Subucula‚’ Varro says (Ling. Lat. iv. 30),
is derived from ‘subtus’ Martial hus this
