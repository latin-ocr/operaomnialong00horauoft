691

Levabit cultu, virtute earentia tollet,
Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut qui

Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.

125

Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,

Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,
Quam sapere et ringi. Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,
Qui se credebat miros audire tragoedos,

In vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro ς

130

Caetera qui vitae servaret munia recto
More, bonus sane vicinus, amabilis hospes,
comis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis
Et signo laeso non insanire lagenae,

Posset qui rupem et puteum vitare patentem.

135

Hic ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus
Expulit'elleboro morbum bilemque meraco
Et redit ad sese: “ Pol me occidistis, amici,
Non servastis‚” ait, “ cui sic extorta voluptas

Et demptus per vim mentis grat-issimus error.”

140

Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis,
Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum;

128. virtute carentia tollet] Dillenb.
and Orelli interpret ‘ tollet' as ‘ extollet,'
like Quintilian’s “premere tumentia, hu-
milia extollare” (x. 4. l): and Cicero (de
Ont. iii. 26). “ Summa 18118 eloquentiae
ot amplificare rem ornando, quod valet non
solum ad augendum aliquid et tollendum
alfius diceudo, sed etiam ad extenuandum
at abjiciendum.” In these passages there

commentatus suppose, he would have ex-
pressed it more plainly. The words mean
‘lia will remove what lacks merit? He will
work 118111 (torquebitur) to produce a re-
uult which shall appear playful and easy,
the turm being as easy as those of the
‘ mimus,’ who (lances either the light mea-
sure of *the nimble Satyr or the clumsy
dance of the Cyclops (on which see S. i. 5.
63 n.). The poet’s art is to conoeal his
art, and to make that appear easy which
has eost him trouble. ⁸

126. Praetukrim scriptor] This is sup-

to be the remark of one who would
be a poet without the necessary trouble.
He would rather be pleased with his own
bad verses, even though hc might be de-
oeiving himself, than be so learned and be
perpetually vexed with himself. ‘ Ringi ’
is properly applied to the grinning of a dog

when it snarls.

128. Fuit haud ignobilis· Arqis] Sir
Henry Halford furnishes a parallel story
(Essays, p. 61): “One case, that of the
gentleman of Argoa whose delusion led
him to suppose that he was attending the
representation of a play as he sat in his
bed›chamber‚ is so exact, that 1 saw a per-
son of exalted rank (George 111.) under
those very circumstances of delusion, and
heard him call upon Mr. Garrick to exert
himself 111 the performance of Hamlet.”

131. Caetera qui vitae servaret] ‘Though
he oboerved all the other duties of life?

134. Et siquo laeso] The ‘amphorae’
or ‘lagenae’ were sealed with the owner's
seal when they were filled. Horace says
that the man was not one who would be.
furious if he found the slaves had opened a
‘lagena’ and drunk the contents. See
C. iii. 8. 11, 12.

135. puteum vitare patentem] Wells
were usually surrounded witha wall (‘pu-
teal’) two or three feet high.

136. coynatorum] See S. ii. 3. 217 11,,
811(1 88 to ‘ elleborum ’ see v. 83 of that Sa·
tire. [Opibusz see Epp. i. 10. 36.] ‘Me-
racus' is generally applied only to wine.
Persius (iv. 16) also applioe it to hellebore:
“ Anticyras melior sorbere meracas.’'
