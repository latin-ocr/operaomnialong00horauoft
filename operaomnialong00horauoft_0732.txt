nized the spirits of the good 3 the other
two represented cruel spirits which terrify
'and torment the living. As to Lemures,
see Epp. ii. 1. 138 n. A festival called
Lemuria or Remuria, said to have been
established by Romulus to appease the
spirit of his brother, was celebrated for

more natural.
