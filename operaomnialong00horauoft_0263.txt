17. Baetis] The reading of all but a
very few Mss„ and those of 110 great
weight‚ that of Acron and Porphyrion [of
Servius, Aeneid. i. 247], and every edition
till Bentkey’s, is ‘Baeti’ (‘Rhaeti’ or

‘Reti‚' but ‘Raeti' is the form which is
ῗὲιῖἓῖῗέῗψῗῃῒὲἒἓζᾶἰξᾷξῖεῗέἒῖἑῗιῗὲ
of the combined people was ‘ Raeti Vinde-
lici. Other MSS. have ‘ et Vindelici,’ but
these are all modern. Dillenbr. retains

‘Raeti' without inserting ‘et,’ and sup-

au anacoluthon to 111-188 out of the
digression (18—22). Cunningham‚ who
adopts ‘ Raetis? will not allow Bentley the
merit of an original conjecture, and he ac-
knowl that N. Heinsius had hit upon
the same before him. The reading appears
to me to be the true one (see Introduction).
[The evidence however is decidedly for the
reading ‘Raeti,’ and if we accept the ‘et'
before ‘Vindelici‚’ we get rid of the dif-
ficulty created by ‘Raeti Vindelici,’ who
were different peoples. Ritter has ‘ Raeti'
—Vindelici.] Several editors cast out the
words ‘quibus— omnia' as totally unmean-
ing, and Franke rejects them as ‘ineptum
glossema? He would have been abold scribe
that would thrust such lines into the text.
Tbey are quoted by Servius on Aen. i. 247,
and, whatever may be thought of their
beauty or aptitude, they must be looked upon
as genuine. Τ118 Scholiasts, pretending to
interpret the lines, only infer from them
that the Vindelici derived their racc from
the Amazons. All 778 0811 gather from
these verses is, that the Vindelici carried
