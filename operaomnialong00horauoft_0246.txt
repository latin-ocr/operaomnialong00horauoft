210 HORATII FLACCI

“ Icarus Icariis nomina fecit aquis.'’ “ Sec· the rest. He is not speaking with exact-
tus diwsus: eoquod unapars orbis Europae ness. So the chorus in Soph. Trach. 98,
nomen accepit, altera Asia dicta est '’ asks,

(Acron). Varro (de Ling. Lat. v. 31) says πόθι μοι πόθι παῖς

“ Divisa est caeli regionibus terra in Asiam ναίει ποτ’- - .

et Europam.” Horace seems to give Eu· ἦ rou-riom αὐλῶνας ἢ

OARMEN XXVIII.

Who was Lyde Ρ Α gentlewoman, noble, honest, and learned, also very grave and
severe, but a friend (in an honourable sense) of Horace, says one; Horace’s ‘ villica,’ says
another ς his mistress, says a third 3 a musician, a dancer, a prostitute; and so the com-

mentators differ, as well they may, when they try to fix the character and position of

⁴ one who may be any body or nobody at all. This ode must have been written some

years after the eleventh of this book, because then Lyde was but a young thing and
chaste3 now it is clear that she had been in the habit of entertaining Horace her
lover, and had given him a supper at more of these annual festivals of Neptune than the
present. So says Dacier. Lyde was the same person as Pyrrha (C. i. 5), says Grote-
fend; as Lydia, says another German of less note. But did Horace di-ne with Lyde or
Lyde with Horace on this memorable 23rd J ulyi’ The critics are as little agreed upon
that point as on the other, and we may therefore assume that Horace, “qui n'aimoit
pas la presse,'’ stayed at home, ate a quiet dinner, wrote an ode, calling on an imaginary
Lyde to drink his health in a poetical cup of Caecuban wine, and to join him in a song,
that was never sung, to the divinity of the day and the other gods usually honoured on
such occasions. The Neptunalia were celebrated on the 23rd of J uly.

ARGUMEN Τ.

Lyde, bring out the best Caecubum and take wisdom by storm, for what can 1 do better
on Neptune's holiday? The noon is past, make haste. Let us sing in turns3 Ι of
Neptune and the Nereids, you of Latona and Diana ς both of us together of Venus,
and we will not forget a song for Night.

Fnsro quid potius die

Neptuni faciam? Prome reconditum
Lyde strenua Caecubum

Munitaeque adhibe vim sapientiae.

2. faciam] Bentley reads ‘facias‚’ be· he will have ‘facias.’ ‘Reconditum ’ is
cause Horace is not advising himself but explained by (C. ii. 3. 8) “Interiore nota
Lyde, and dining with her; on which Falerni.'’ ‘Strenua' is put instead of the
grounds, “vel centum codicibus invitis,'’ adverb. “ Strenua: cita ’³ (Acron).
