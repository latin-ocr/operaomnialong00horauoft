] Aulus Gellius (Noct. Att v.
12) says that this name was given to Jove
ns ‘diei et lucis puter, ’ and Macrobius givoe
the nme derivation. ‘Dies' is an old form
of the genitive (Key's Gr. 5 146). But
probably the two first syllables are only a
different form of‘ J up- in J uppiter and
fmm the sume root as Ζεύς.

Lambinus has collected many more in-
stsnees. Lucretius denies the possibility
of such anomslous thunder (vi. 247)—

-——“nam cselo nulls sereno

Nem-ly all the old editions put a stop aster
‘dividens’ andjoin ‘plerumque' with what
fflllowz, which makes nonsense. The Scho-
liastsdidnotresdthepasssgeso, nor Inn-
dinus, otherwise Ι have met with none till

In C. iii. 4. 45 the earth is ‘inei-8? The
promontory Taenarum in Laconica was oue

11. Atlanteuquefinis] Apparently imi-
taoed from Eurip. (ffipp. 3), τερμόνων τ’
’Δτλαηικῶν- [The ‘ Atlanteus finis ' is the
Atlas mountains in Libyn]

12. Valet ima summis] We may com-
pare this with various familiar passages of
the sacred Scriptures ; as, “ He hath put
down the mighty from their sest, aud ex-
alted them of low degree ’⁹ (Luke i. 52).

“Promotion cometh neither from the esst,
nor from the west, nor from the south. But
God is the Judge3 he putteth down one, and
setteth up another'’ (Psalm lxxv. 6, 7).
The sentiment however ις common. Taci-
tus seems to have had Horace' s words ιιι
his mind when he wrote of the public fune-
ral given to Flavius Sabinus and the over·
thmw of Vitellius, that they were “magns
documenta instabilis fortunae summaque
et ims miscentis '¹ (Hist. iv. 47). Seneca
has the nme words in his Th5estes (598).

“lmspermutat levis hors summis; ”Auso-
nius in his 143rd epigram says of Fortme,

“Et summa in imum vertit et versa erigit.’'
Horace' s words were no doubt familiar to
these writers. Bentley would read ‘in-
signe ’ for ‘fiusignem to keep the opposi-
tion uniform. Cun· mngham with more
consisteucy would havmneg‘ insignia? com-
pming Virg. Aen. vi. 33—

“Bis pat-riae cecidere manus. Quin proti-
nus omma
Pel-legerent oculis‚'’

and other like places. But ‘insignem'
(the reading of all the MSS.) has more
poetry in it than the neuter, and is more
expressive of the vicissitudae of human
life. Bentley supposes Horace to have
had in mind Hosiod's Works and Dnys
(Ssqqq) Ῥέα. μὲνγὰρ βριάει ῥέα δὲ βριά-
