Ad mare cum veni generosum et lene requiro,
Quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

Utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent,

Fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi,

Impransus non qui civem dinosceret hoste,

also (xiv. c.. 6) aava that Tiberius declared
it was no better than vinegar, and only
owed its character to the doctors. Ho-
race did not think it worth while to ask
about the wine, which he knew was bad.

37. corrector Bestias] 'l'his readiug' is
due to Lambinus, who first conjectured it,
ami, before the publication ofJ his second
edition, found it in one of his oldest MSS„
but did not take it into the text. Bentley
was the first editor to adopt it. Most
modern editors have done the same. The
meaning, if this is the true reading, is,
that Maenius, wbcnever he could not get
a good dinner from one of those who
patronized or were afraid of him, would
dine prodigiously off tripe and coarse
mntton, and then declare all livers
ought to be branded on the belly: a
censor as strict as Bestius, who was no
doubt some person well known at the
time, perhaps as a spare liver or repr-over
of profligate living, though nothing is
known of him now. ‘,Corrector’ which
