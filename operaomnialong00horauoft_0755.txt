Nec, si quid fricti ciceris'probat et nucis emptor,

Aequis accipiunt animis donantve corona.

Syllaba longa brevi subjecta vocatur iambus,
Pes citus; unde etiam trimetris accrescere jussit
Nomen iambeis‚ cum senos redderet ictus

Primus ad extremum similis sibi.
'tardior ut paulo graviorque veniret ad auree,

Spondeos stabiles in jura paterna recepit
Commodus et patienS, non ut de sede secunda

Cederet aut quarta socialiter.

Nobilibus trimetris apparet rarus, et Enni

In scenam missos cum magno pondere versus

Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis
Aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.
Non quivis videt immodulata poemata judex,
Et data Romanis venia est indigna postis.

251. &ssaha los-,qa brevi] As ’ω the
‘iambus ’ see above, v. '79 sq. Horace here
calls it ‘pes citus: a rapid foot, as else-
where (C. i. 16. 54) he speaks of ‘celeres
iambos? He says the rapidity of the foot
eanfled the division of the verse into the
form of a trimeter, although it was a
‘ senarius? having six distinct iambic feet.
'Hie admission of a spondee in the odd feet,
he says, was an aster invention, in order to
*give more weight to the measure. What
he means by ‘non ita pridem' is not very
cle-r. I suppose he means comparativer
lately ; but the verses of Archilochus had
spoudees in them. The history is not very
accurate. Horace has himselfimitated the

iambic measure in the alternate ver-
ses of Epod. 16. ‘ In jura paterna recepit’
1 suppose is ω be rendered ‘ gave a share
of its pstrimony? The meaning is clear

spondes, but not disposed to be so accom-
modating ts to give up the even places ιιι
the verse, seems rather a heavy joke. ‘ So-
cialiter? ‘in a friendly way, ’does not occur
elsewhere.

56. The ‘iambus' Horace says is not com·
mouly used in the verses of Accius and
Ennius. Those of Accius he mlls noble
trimeters, by which he means famed. He
was no great admirer of them himself. The
great weight he attributes to the verses of
Ennius arose from the gravity of the mea-
sure, consisting, as v. 260 does, chiefly of
spondees. But the absence of the ⁶ iambus‚’
in the opinion of Horace, convicts him either
of slovenly writiug or of iguorance of his
art. Bentley puts a full stop aster‘ Enni:
and chapges‘ missos ’into‘ missus, 'making
‘versus ’the nominative ense to ‘premitl
‘Hic’ the iambus' is rare (apparet rarus)
in Accius, and the‘ iambus‚’ that is the rare
appearance of the‘ iambus‚’ lioe heavy on
(premit) the verses of Ennius.
265. an munes] This, and not ‘at’ οι·
‘et, ' is the reading of nearly all the MSS.
Horace says itis not every critic that mn
tell a rhythmical verse from an unrhy th-
mical, and so an indulgence they do1 not
deserve is aoeorded to our poets. ‘But am
I on this account to take all manner of li-
berties⁹ Or, on the other hand, am I to
