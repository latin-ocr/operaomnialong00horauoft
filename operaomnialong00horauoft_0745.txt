Fervidus, et matrona potens an sedula nutrix,
Mercatorne vagus cultorne virentis agelli,

J ura neget sibi nata, nihil non arroget armis.
- Sit Medea ferox invictaque, flebilis Ino,

Perfidus Ixion, Io vaga, tristis Orestes.

114. divum loquatur an heros] The
Scholiasts are divided between ‘ divus’ and
‘Davus ς’ the MSS. are also at variauce.
The Blandiniau are in favour of ‘divus,'

and all Orelli's, except that three have ‘ a’ “

superscribed. 1 think “divusne' is the

true reading, and that ⁸ Davus ’ arose out of
v. 237 = ‘⁸ Ut nihil intersit Davusne loqua-
tm· et audax Pythias? ‘ Deus ’ and ‘ heros ’
are brought together below (v. 227) : “ Ne

this antithesis were in a measure proverbial
(Comparatio Aristophanis et Menandri,
ο. 1) ε-ὅστερ ἀπὸ κλήρου ἀπονέμει τοῖς
ambron τὰ προστυχόντα τῶν ὀνομάτων,
καὶ οὒκ δι διαγνοίης, εἴτε υἱός ἐστιν, εἴτε

⁷ πατήρ, ebr' ἄγροικος, εἴτε θεός, εἴτε γραῦς,

εἴτε ἦρος, ὁ διαλεγόμενος.

116. matrona potens] This epithet seems
ω have the same meaning as the kindred
word πότνια in Homer and the Τ
The officiens nurse has always been a fa-
vourite character on the stage. We find it
iu Aeschylus (Choephoroe), in Sophocles

⁰ “ ), and Euripides (Hippolytus).
We are all sufficiently familiar with it in
Shakspeare’s Romen and J uliet. In Euri-
pides’ play and Shakspeare’s they bear in
one much the same character. An
ἔμπορος (‘mercat0r’) is introduced in the
Philoctetes of Sophocles and the prologue
of the Electra (Euripides) is spoken by an
αὐτουργός (¹ cultor agelli '). The Colchian
may represent any of the barbarous tribes
on the shores of the Euxine, and the Assy-
rian any of the Eastern nations. (C. i.
2. 21 n., and C. ii. 11. 16 11.) The opposi-
tion between Thebes and Argos has refe-
rence partly perhaps to Aeschylus' play,
Sept. c. Thebas, in which Polynices comes
with an Argive army to takc possession of
the mwn of Thebes or to the Supplices

iaus. v

of Euripides, which turns on the burial
of the seven leaders who formed that ex-
pedition. But Horace may have had in
mind many other plays of which the scene
lay either at Argos or Thebes, in connexion
with Oedipus, the quarrel of his sons, or
the expedition of the Epigoni.

120. Sm'ptorhonoratum risorie reponis]
⁴ Honoratus' (for which Bentley on his own
conjecture substitutes ‘ Homerenm ' in one
of his very long notes—‘⁶ meris argutiiS‚'’
says Fea) is only au epitheton ornans, cor-
respondiug to Homer-’s κλυτός, δῖε. [Ritter
understands it literally, honoured by Zeus,
as in Iliad, i. 510: but 1 do not accept his
&iffffigffiffllhss {2933} 22¹3& 2¹33}ssssss
sense v. 190: “Fabula quae posci vult et
spectata reponi.’'

122. nihil uon arroget armis] ‘ Let him
claim every thing for arms,’ that is, let him
make arms his one appeal.

123. flebilis Ino] There are several
fragments of a play by Euripides bearing
the name of Ino, the daughter of Cadmus,
and wife of Athamas, who threw herself
into the sea with her son Melicerta, and
went through various sorrows through the
wrath of Here, and the rivalry of her hus-
band's other wives, Nephele and Themisto.
She was worshipped aster her death as
Leucothea, or Matuta Mater.

124. Perfidus Ixion, Io naqa] Aeschylus,
Sophocle& and Euripides, each wrote a
tmgedy entitled ‘ Ixion,' of which frag-
ments remain. He was king of the La-
pithae. Having treacherously murdered
his father-indaw, DeioneuS, he returned
the goodness of Zeus, who purified him, by
trying to seduce Here, for which he received
his well-known punishment, and is rightly
called ‘perfidus.' The wanderings of Io,
the daughter of Inachus, king of Argos,
in the form of a cow, whose passage across
