Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere plumbum

HORATII FLACCI

Quam quae per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum?
Nempe inter varias nutritur silva columnas,
Laudaturque domus longos quae prospicit agros.
Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret,

glass; but there is one of marble supposed
to represent the battle of Issus, which sur-
passes every other specimen that has yet
been discovered. It is only part of the
whole, but that part contains twelve horses,
a war chal-iot, and twenty-two persons, in-
cluding Darius and Alexander with his
horse Bucephalus, all admirably executed
more than half the size of lise.

20. aqua tendit rumpere plumbum] The
use of leaden pipes for conveying water is
referred to in au inscription containing an
edict of Augustus for the supply of water
to the town of Venafrum: “ Quaeque aqua
in oppidum Venafranoruin it, fluit, ducitur,
eam aquam distribuere, discribere ven-
dundi causa ..... jus potestatemve esse
placet, dum ne ea aqua quae ita distributa,
discripta . . . . . erit aliter quam fistulis
'plumbeis d. t. (DUMTAXAT) ab rivo p. L.
(PEDES QUINQUAGINTA) dueatur? Ho-
racc’s ‘ plumbum ’ means lenden pipes.
(The inscription settles the question of
‘ diseribere' or ‘ describere.’ See A. P. 86
n.; C. ii. 13. 23; and Long²s note on Cic.
in Verr. ii. 3. 30.) Ovid also uses the
bursting of a leaden pipe to illustrate the
spurting of blood from a wound (Met. iv.

‘⁶ Non aliter quam cum vitiato fistula

Scpffipgpp, et tenues stridente foramine

Ejzlzctliifftur aquas atque ictibus aera
rumpit.''

Cisterns were called ‘castellass and there
were three sorts: ‘publica‚' which received
the water intended for public purposes3
‘,privata’ which were the common pro-
peity of several persons who clubbed to-

gether to build them, and laid on pipes to
conduct the water to their ‘castella do-
mestica? the cisterns in their own houses.
These pipes therefore intersected the whole
city. As mentioned before (S. i 4. 37 ιι.>,
those who could not afford to have water
laid on at their houses resorted to the
‘lacus' or public tanks erected for their
convenience in several parts of the town.
The p‘ipes were called ‘ fistulae? [Fronti-

nus, De Aquae ductibus Urbis Romae.
‘Vici' are the quarters of the city. S. i.
9. 13. See Seneca, Ep. 90, who alludes to
artificia} fountains, ‘quemadmodum in im·
mensam altitudinem erocum latentibus
fistulis exprimat.’]

21. trepidat eum murmure] Compare
C. ii. 3. 11: “obliquo laborat Lympha
fugax trepidare rivo.”

22. nutritur silva columnae] See note
on C. iii. 10. 5: “nemus Inter pulchra
satum tecta.” Compare Tibullus (iii. 3.
15) : “ Et nemora in domibus sacros imi-
tantia lucos.'' Shrubs and flowers were
planted in the ‘impluvium,' but more largely
in the ⁴ peristylium.' an open space at the
back part of the house, surrounded by
colonnades, ancl usually, like the ‘implu-
vium. ’ with a cistern or fountain in the
middle.

24. Naturam expellas-furca] This was
a common expression. Lambinus restored
it in a corrupt passage of Cicero (ad Att.
xvi. 2). “sed quoniam furcilla extrudi-
mur, Brundisium cogito? where the com-
mon reading was ‘furore illo? Lambinus
quotes Catullus (105): ‘furcillis ejiciunt ;’
and Aristophanes (Pax. 635) :—

οἴ δὲ ’γιγνώσκοντες εὖ
τοὺς πένητας ἀσθενοῦντας κάποροῦντας
ἀλφίτων
τήνδε μὲν. (εἰρήνην) δικροῖς ἐώθουν τὴν
θεὸν κεκράγμασιν·

where δικρὰ κεκράγματα is a oonoeit for
eries that acted like a pitchfork to toss
peace out of the city. Lucian (Tim. 12)
has καὶ μόνον οὐχὶ δικράνοις με ἐξεώθει τῆς
οἰκίας. Erasmus explains the metaphor in
‘furca’ by the practice of forcing down
branches of shrubs by means of a forked
stick, and when this is removed the bough
rises again. But that is clearly wrong:
forcible ejectiou is meant. Cicero says
(Tusc. v. 27), referring to the eagerness of
Indian widows to be burnt with their hus-
band' s body (a fiction which it appears hc
believed). “nunquam naturam mos vin-
ceret, cst enim ea semper invicta. Sed
nos umbris, deliciis, otio, languore, desidia
animum infecimus: opinionibus maloque
more delinitum mollivimus.'' This ex-
