HORATII FLACCI

Garrulus atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

Scribendj recte ι nam ut multum nil moror.

Ecce,

Crispinus minimo me provocat : “ Accipe, si vis,

Accipiam tabulas 3 detur nobis locus, hora,

Custodes 3 videamus uter plus scribere possit? ‚r
“ Di bene fecerunt inopis me quodque pusilli
Finxerunt animi, raro et perpauca loquentiS.

tus ’ is explained by Acron as “sordidus;
cui contrarium luculentus,” which expla-
nation combines two notions, dirtiness
and obscenity. Lucilius may have irni-
tated the obscenity of the old comediam 3
and in this, as in other respectS, his verse
may have been like a muddy stream. The
word, no doubt, comprehends defects of
taste as well as style. “ Erat quod tollere
velles ’' is interpreted by the Scholiasts
“ex quibus sunt nonnulla quae velis inde
excerpere et pro tuis habere’' (Porph.).
“ Erat quod velles imitari ” (Acron). Cru-
quius' Scholiast gives the same interpre-
- tation, and Heindorf adopts it. Quintilian
says (x. 1. 94)2 “Ab Horatio dissentio qui
Lucilium fluere lutulentum et esse aliquid
quod tollere possis putat,'’ where he uses
the word ‘possis’ for ‘velles,’ quoting from
memory. Horace's word ‘ velles' fixes the
meaning of ‘ tollere’ ‘ to remove‚' even if
the whole context did not do so. ‘You
would wish for the credit of the author to
remove it.’ [Horace (S. i. 10. 50) refers
to this passage and opposes ‘ tollenda' to
‘relinquenda.' Ritter gives the other
meaning: ‘though he ran in a muddy
stream, yet there was enough for a man
to pick out and keep.']

12. piyer scribendi serre laborem]
‘ Piger ferre’ is a Greek construction coni-
mon in the Odes, but not in the Satires.
(C i. 1. 18 n.) ln C. iv. 14. 22, we have
‘impiger' in the same construction ι “ lm-
piger hostium vexare turmas?

[13. nam ut multum m'l moror] ‘For
as to quantity, Ι care not for that? Comp.
Epp. i. 15. 16.]

14. Crispinus minimo] See S. i. 1. 120
n. ‘Minimo me provocat ' Porphyrion
interprets thus: “ Sensus ex proverbiali
consuetudine ductus ς solemus enim dicere
minimo mc digito provocat cum volumus
quem intelligi tantum valere minimo digito
quantum alius totis viribus.” Acron and
Comm. Cruq. have the same idle talk. The
proverb is probably their own invention.
Erasmus, however, in his book of Proverbs,
takes it up as meaning a contemptuous sort

of challenge3 and Lambinus also follows
the Scholiasts: Cruquius does not. Bentley
quotes a Scholium which gives the right
sense. ‘⁴ Minimo provocare dicuntur ii
quiin responsione (sponsione) plus ipsi per-
mittant (promittant) quam exigant ab ad-
versari0.’' ‘He offers me the greatest
odds’ is the meaning according to this
interpretation, which Bentley adopts, as
far as concerns the wager, but substitutes
as his own conjecture ‘nummo' for ‘mi-
nimo,’ as signifying that Crispinus was so
poor he could only stake a sestertius, 1
do not see any point in such an allusion to
the man's poverty. His confldence of vic-
tory is the matter Horace means to illus-
trate. The MSS. are unanimous in favour
of ‘ minim0‚’ and the Scholiasta and editors
are equally s0; and, if that reading be
right, the interpretation above given must
be right too.

15. Accipiam tabulas] 'Bentley follows
the reading of some MSS. which have
‘accipe jam‚’ and he wonders that nearly all
the editors shouldhave taken up ‘ accipiam ε’
‘jam' he thinks exhibite the eagerness of
the challenger, and his fear lest Horace, if
he let him go on this occasion, should slip
out of the contest altogether. For all this
the passage ass‘ords no warrant. There is
no eagerness or hasta—nothing more than
a polite challenge to see which could write
most verses in a given time. ‘ Take tablets
if you please, and I will take them too?
The omission of the persoual pronoun to
express antithesis is nothing in familiar
talk where there could bc no mistake. ‘Cus-
todes ' arc umpires.

18. raro et perpauca loquentis] Lam-
binus, against all the MSS„ introduced the
reading ‘loquentem,’ which Bentley has
adopted, and others after him. The re-
ceived reading is very natural, and I see
no occasion for altering it. ‘The gods
have done me a kindness iu making me
of a poor and unpretcnding disposition
that speaks but seldom, and very little nt
a time.’ This is Horace's reply to the
challenge, which he declines. f
