HORATII FLACCI

Caputque Marsa dissilire nenia.

Quantum neque atro delibutus Hercules
Nessi cruore, nec Sicana fervida

Virens in Aetna flamma 3 tu donec cinis
Injuriosis aridus ventis ferar

Cales venenis officina Colchicis.

Quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium?
Effare3 jussas cum fide poenas luam,
Paratus expiare, seu poposceris

Centum juvencos, sive mendaci lyra

Voles sonari : Tu pudica, tu proba

compelled then to admit what 1 denied, that
Sabine charms disturb' &c. ‘Nenia' is
used for a charm, as in Ovid A. A. ii. 102) :
“ Mixtaque cum magicis nenia Marsa

by Horace for a night—song (C. iii. 28. 16) 3
for the melancholy poetry of Simonides
(O. ii. 1. 38) 5 and in its proper sense of a
dirge for the dead (C. ii. 20, 21). Cicero
(de Leg. ii. 24) ε “ Honoratorum virorum
laudes in contione memorentur easque
etiam cantu ad tibicinem prosequantur,
cui nomen neuia.”

337 Vra-m] Porcellini interprets this,
with Lambinus and Cruquius, ‘nunquam
intermoriens, sed perpetuis vigens ignibus‚’
and Ι am inclined to adopt that interpre-
tation rather than that of Orelli and Dil-
lenbr.‚ who explained it by the sulphurous

11 flame issuing from the mountain. I
doubt whether there is any thing in the
colour of the flame to authorize such an
epithet, and Bentley makes the same re-
mark. Orelli quotes the authority of his
Ziirich and oldest Berne MSS. for ‘ virens,'
and Lambinus found it in the oldest MSS. :
in the others was ‘urens,’ which he calls
‘ longe ineptissimum? No doubt it arose
out of ‘ virens,' and is so far a confirmation
of that reading. Cruquius' Scholiast had
‘virens‚' and he interprets it ‘ aestuans:
which means nothing, but it shows what
was his reading. Bentley prefers ‘furens‚'
which Lambinus mentions as testing only
on conjecture, but which has since been
found in a few MSS. of no great weight.
Like some other emendations it is too easy
to be admitted against the vast majority of
MSS. ‘ Furere’ is commonly applied to
flames, but that only makes it less likely

40

that such a word should have been super-
seded by one so unusual as ‘ virens.’

35. Gales] Bentley changes this into
the third personz tc do which he is ob-
liged to change ‘tu' into ‘tua,' to the
great detriment of the verse, and to intro-
duce the possessive pronoun where it is not
wanted. The received reading is as old at
least as Porphyrion, who says “ipsam
mulierem officinam venenorum diserte
dixit‚” and so we must take it till some

better emendation than Bentley’s is offered. .

[Ritter]puts an interrogation aster ‘Col-
chicis.' ⁷

36. stipendimn] Forcellini explains this
as “ quaevis multa aut poena‚'' and quotes
Catullus (lxiv. 173): “Indomito nec dira
ferens stipendia tauro Perfidus in Oretam
religasset navita funem ;” but there the
word comes more under the sense of ‘ tri-
butum: of which he gives several in-
stances, the reference being to the tribute
or sacrifice of one hundred youths paid
yearly to the Minotaur. As an equivalent
for ‘poena’ Ι (10 not find that ‘stipendium'
is used elsewhere. It is possible it may
mean ‘ service,' which is its mili sense.
1 have used the word ‘ penalty' in the ar-
gument, but the meaning is doubtful.
‘Quae finis’ means ‘what death ‘t” (See
ii. 18. 29 11.) Oaptives led in triumph were
put to death. See Ep. vii. 8 n.

39. Oentwm juvencos] This is the read-
ing of the MSS„ but Bentley prefers ‘ju-
vencis,’ as in C. i. 4. 12 he preferred ‘ agna’
and ‘haedo.’ I prefer the accusative in
both places· ‘Sono' is used as an active
verb only by the poets, aster the manner
of ἠχεῖν. The satire of what follows is
very amusing. In his plea for forgiveness
he repeats his offence‚ implying that to call
her chaste he must lie, which however he is
willing to do. The following words are the
