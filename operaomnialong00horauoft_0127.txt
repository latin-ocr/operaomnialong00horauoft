GARMEN ΠΙ.

The person to whom this ode is nominally addressed is supposed generally to be
Q- Dellius, who, from being a follower first of Dolabella and then of Brutus and Cassius,
hemme a devoted adherent of M. Antonius, and his tool throughout his intrigues with
Cleopatra, till shortly before the battle of Actium, when he quarrelled with Cleopatra
and joined Octavianus, who received him with favour (Plut. Anton. c. 59). Plutarch
calls him ἱᾳτορικός. Comm. Cruq. gives the name ‘ Genius: and Horace had a friend
Ia. Gellius Poplicola, brother of Messalla, whom he alludes to in Sat. i. 10. 85, and who
wastaken prisoner by Brutus and Cassius. (See Estre, p. 174.) Whether we take
Dellius or Gellius it matters little. Horaee’s way of giving a name to his odes has been
sufficiently notioed, and in this, as in other essee, there is nothing to guide us to the
person whose name he uses. The ode is on two of his usual common-places, moderatiori
and the certainty of death. 1 cannot go with Franks in assigning the ode to Aemo. 725
in the nneertainty that hang-s over the person.
