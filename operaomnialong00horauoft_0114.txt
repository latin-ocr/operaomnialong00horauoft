HORATII FLACCI

Te *semper anteit saeva Necessitas
Clavos trabales et cuneos manu
Gestans aena, nec severus

Uncus abest liquidumque plumbum.

Te Spes et albo rara Fides colit
Velata panno nec comitem abnegat,
Utcunque mutata potentes
Veste domos inimica linquis.

At volgus infidum et meretrix retro

Periura cedit, diffugiunt cadis
Cum faece siccatis amici
Ferre jugum pariter dolosi.
Serves iturum Caesarem'in ultimos

Orbis Britannos et juvenum recens

chariots ?’' There are four objects in re-
spect of which Fortune is here said to be
invoked—the seasons, the winds, war, and
faction. See Introduction.

14. Stantem columnam] The figures of
Peace, Security‚ Happiness, and others, are
represented ou old monuments as resting
on a column. Addisou (Dial. ii. on Medals)
mentions a medai of Antoninus Pius on the
reverse of which SECURITAS PUBLmA is
thus represented. [‘Proruas,' ‘overthrow.’
Comp. Aeschyl. Persae, 159, μὴ μέγας
πλοῦτος κονίσαςοῦδας ἀντρέψῃ ποδὶ “Ολβον.]

17. Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas]
The several things that Necessity is here
represented as holding are emblems of te·
nacity and fixedness of purpose—the nail,
the clamp, and the molten lead: they have
nothing to do with torture as many have
supposed. [Ritter reads ‘ serva ' for
‘ saeva,' and interprets it ‘ as a slave.’ He
defends his reading by the authority of
some of the oldest MSS. and Scholia, and
by an argument which seems to me worth
nothing. Keller has ‘saeva.']

18.] ‘ Clavi trabales ’ had passed into a
proverb with the Romans. Compare Cicero
in Verr. Act. ii. 5. 21: “ut hoc beneficium,
quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clavo fige-
ret.’' ‘ Cunei ' were also nails Wedge-
shaped, the diminutive of which, ‘ cuneoli‚'
Cicero employs in translating a passage
from Plato’s Timaeus (p. 1055), οὐ τοῖς
ἀλύτοις οἷς αὐτοὶ συνείχοντο δεσμοῖς ἀλλὰ
διὰ σμικρότητα ἀοράτως πυκνοῖς γόμφοις
συντήκοντες, which Cicero renders ‘crebris
qnasi cuneolis injectis' (Tim. 13). This
sense of ‘ cuneus ³ occurs in Cicero’s trans-
lation from Aeschylus (Tusa. ii. 10), where

γ Prometheus fastened to the rock says of

“ Hos ille cuneos fabrica crudeli inserens

Pindar uses the same metaphor (Pyth.
iv. 71), τίς δὲ κίνδυνος κρατεροῖς ἀδάμαντος
δῆσεν ἅλοις ; and Aeschylus (Sup. 944),
τῶν δ’ ἐφήλωται τορῶς ’γόμφος διάμπαξ ὣς
ἕὲἲῗὲἷέἓῖἓόέωἶῑῖ {2⁸ 3oe¹'⁹zc⁴'i;e 3235.ssss ⁵1¹5}
molten lead, used in buildings, is 1?st by
Euripides (Androm. 267), καὶ γὰρ εἷ πέριξ
α’ ἔχει τηκτὸς μόλυβδος.

21.] The picture represented in this and
the following stamas, apart from the alle-
gory, is that of a rich man in adversity
going forth from his home with hope in his
breast, and accompanied by a. few faithful
friends, but deser-ted by those who only
cared for his wealth. In the person of
Fortune is represented the man who is
suffering from her reverses‚ aud in that of
Fidelity the small (rara) company of his
true friends. Fortune is represented in the
garments of mourning (mutata veste), and
Fides in a white veil emblematic of her
purity. With such a veil on their head
men offered sacrifice to her, according to
the Scholiasts. She is called by Virgil
(Aen. i. 292) ‘ Cana Fides: where Servius
has a note which connects the expression
with this of Horace. But there it properly
means ‘aged' Numa (Livy, i. 21) esta·
blished religious rites for Fides.

22. nec comitem abnegat] Ovid (A. A.
i. 127) has copied this expression, which is
the same as if ‘ se ' had been added: “Si
qua repugnarat nimium comitemque ne-
