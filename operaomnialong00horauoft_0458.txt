48. Non isto vivimus illic] We may
imagine the indignation with which Ho-
race listened to the insolence of his com-
panion. He represents himself throughout
the scene as one wanting in the self-pos-
session necessary for dealing with such a
person, and here he shows it again. Instead
of passmg by such impertinence with con-
tempt, or making it, as with more address
he might have done, an excuse for leaving
the man, he replies to him, and vehemently
defends his patron and himself. His 8(1-
versary’s impertinence only rises higher
with this, as might be expected, and is
not diminished by the ill-timed irony in
‘velis tantummodo: quae tua virtus, ex-
pugnabis,’ &c.‚ all of which may be sup-
posed to be said in a state of excitement
only calculated to give the coxcomb cou-
rage, he keeping his temper and pretending
not to see Horace's indignation. This
must have been worked up to a great height
when the man, persisting in the notion
that perseverance and intrigue are sure
ways of necess to the great man, declares
he will take Horace at his word, and leave
no means untried to secure not only an ac-
quaintance, but the nearest place' 1n Mae-
cenas' regard (54). All this brings out
the contrast between the two characters
(the one a mere man of the world, of a low
sort, and the other a well· bred but not
very energetic gentleman) with great force
and m a very amusing way. For‘ vivimus'
(v. 48) Bentley reads‘ vivitur’ on the 811-
thority of three inferior MSS„ and quoting
C. ii. 16: “vivitur pauo bene ’³ But the

cases are quite different, and there is more
personal feeling expressed by ‘ vivimus'
than by ‘ vivitur? All the oldest and best
MSS. and editions have ‘ vivimus? Bent-
ley also adoptS, with bad taste, ‘ inquam’
for ‘ unquam ’ in v. 50. The former word
is quite out of place here; but it is not

‘Sic habet' is 8 literal adaptation of οὕτως
ἔχει. 011 the construction‘ quae tua vir-
tus,’ see Key' sL. G. 1131.

59. deducam]‘ ‘Haec enim ipsa sunt
honorabilia quae videntur levia atque com-
munia, salutari, appeti, decedi, assurgi, (18-
duci, reduci, consuli '’ (Cic. de Senect. c.
18). To attend upon a person when 118
leaves home is ‘ deducere ς’ ‘reducere’ to
accompany him on his return. Great men,
when they went out of doorS, were usually
accompanied by friends, while numbers of
parasites and expectante followed their
steps and were eager to be seen by them
and to be known to have been in their
company. Elated with the iden. of his in-
tended success, the man becomes eloquent
and breaks out with 8 sentiment worthy of
the noblest ambition‚ like that of Sopho-
cles (Elect. 945), πόνου τοι χωρὶς οὐδὲν
εὐτυχεῖ. [And the 11118 of Epicharmus·
