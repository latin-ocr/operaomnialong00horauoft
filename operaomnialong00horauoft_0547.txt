Quod nimium institerat viventi. Cautus adito:
Neu desis operae neve immoderatus abundes.

Diffieilem et morosum offendet garrulus ultro3

Non etiam sileas, Davus sis comicus atque
Stes capite obstipo, multum similis metuenti.
Obsequio grassare ; mone, si increbuit aura,
Cautus uti velet carum oaput; extrahe turba

Oppositis humeris; aurem substringe loquaci.

mys that ‘ultra’ is the reading of the

losophers who go about “ obstipo eapite et
figentes lumine terram? ‘ Obstipo' there-
fore means stiff, unbending, or bent down-
wurds‚ with the eyes fixed on the ground.
As to ‘multum similis: see S. i. 3. 57 ιι.,
and Epp. i. 10. 3.

93. Obsequio gratem] ⁸ Grassor' is a
frequentative form of ‘gradior,' and sig-
nifies ιο go on, advanoe. The expression in
the text is like ‘grassari dolo’ (Tac. nist.
iv. 16), and other like phrases. Livy aud
Tacitus use the word osten. The MSS.
vary between ‘increbuit’ ‘increbruitssand

‘increpuit.’ Fen adopts the last, though

92. δια eapite obst spo] Suetonius, de-
scribing Tiberius, says (e. 68)st ‘incedebat
cervice rigida et obstipa? “hic est qui
Graec'n dicitur βυσαύχην, nam βύειι est
stipare—contrarii suut his qui rigida cer-
vice eapite retrorsum adducto incedunt

. of the second syllable is short. All the

Paris MSS. have ‘increpuit’ or ‘ increbuiw

”except three, which have ‘ increbruit! The

oldest Bland. had ‘increbruit,' the others
au ‘increpuit.' One of the Berne has
‘ increbuit: another ‘ increpuit‚' and I take
the latter ιο be merely a corruption in-
troduced by copyists who found ‘incre-
buit‚’ aud thought it waswrong. Lambinus
Torrentius and others argue for ‘ incre-

The root
of the word is ‘ creb‚' and the second ‘r’
is no part of the root. See note on Cic.
in Verr. ii. 2. 3, by ΜΓ. Long.

95. aurem substringe loquaci] ‘ Strin-
gere’ means to grasp in the hand; ‘aurem
substringe' therefore may mean to hold up
the em· as we commonly do when we wish
to catch every word that is said. Other
explanations have been given, but they all
come to the same point, which cannot be
mistaken. He was to pay the strictest
attention to the old man, let him be as
gun-ulons as he would. “ aurem
subjecta manu et qnasi collige. Sic voetis
substringi dicitur quae attollitur et ac-
cingitur'’ (J uvencius).
