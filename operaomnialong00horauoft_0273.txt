1 think Orelli’s notion, that‘ pius' and
‘dives' would sound too much like oppo-
sition, as if Aeneas were poor and Tullus
rich, of any weight. Bentley propom to
‘dives' into‘ pauper, 'because the
kings ofold were poor. But he has no
authority, and Horace’ s purpose is to
show that no means are sufficient to bring
back the dead, not piety‚ nor wealth‚ nor
power. I have on this assumption adopted
‘pius' as having more meaning here than

CARMINUM IV. 7.

For ‘summae ' there are MSS„ and among
others the Blandinian above mentioned,
which read· vitae: which also appears iu
Ven. 1483, but it is only a gloss. No
copyist would have invented‘ summae?
‘Amicoanimodare’ seems to bea literal

Suno-

splendida] This is an unusual
word for such a meaning. Eoi-cell. inter·
prets it‘ ‘praeclaram et aequam senten-
tiam et probatam omnibus‚” and 1 do not
know that there is any further meaning
in the word. It may have reference to
the august character yof the tribunal, as
Orelli says.

25.] Horace follows the Greek legend
respecting Diana and Hi p.polytus Ovid
(Met. xv. 543 sqq q) makes him return
from the dead, being brought to life by
the skill of Aesculapius. See also Aen.
vii. 765sq sqq. The common story of
Theseus and his friend is, that both
having been eonsigned to their punish-
ment together, Hercules went down and
delivered Theseus, leaving Peirithous to
his fate. I do not see why this should
not be the legend Horace follows: it may
be understood that Theseus pleaded for
Peirithous when he was himself returning,
but failed to obtain his release. Dillenbr.

supposes Horace to have followed some
different legend or to have altered the
common one himself
