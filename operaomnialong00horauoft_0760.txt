HORATII FLACCI

Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poctaffi
Aut simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vitae.

Quidquid praecipies esto brevis, ut cito dicta

-335

Percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles;
Omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat.
Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris,
Nec quodcunque volet poscat sibi fabula credi,

Neu pransae Lamiae vivum puerum extrahat alvo.

340

Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis,
Celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ramnes :
Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,
Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo.

Hic meret acra liber Sosiis ,- hic et mare transit

345

Et longum noto scriptori prorogat aevum.

Sunt delicta tamen quibus ignovisse velimus3

Nam neque chorda sonum reddit quem vult manus et mens,
Poscentique gravem persaepe remittit acutum 5

Nec semper feriet quodcunque minabitur arcus.

350

Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis
Offendar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit .
Aut humana parum cavit natura. Quid ergo est ⁸?
Ut scriptor si peccat idem librarius usque

Quamvis est monitus venia caret ς ut citharoedus .

Ridetur chorda qui semper oberrat eadem :

smeared with oil of cedar to keep them
from the insects. [Pliny, H. N. 16. c. 39,
quoted by meten] ‘ Capsae cupressinae,’
‘ book-cases of cypress-wood,’ were costly,
and would only be used for vuluable
books.

337. Omne supervacuum] Bentley sus-
pects this verse and puts it in brackets.
He thinks it tame and obscure. It is at
any rate very true that when the mind is
full it discards all superfluous words when
expressing its meaning: it has no room for
superfluities 3 as in a vessel that is full, if
you pour more it runs over and escapes.
As to ‘supervacuus' see O. ii. 20. 2411.
[It is difficult to see what the verse
means. The advice of the poet is, make
your precepts brief. He then says that
‘all superfluous matter flows from a full
breast (mind).’ 1f he had said that ‘all
good matter fiows from a full breast,' we
might understand him. Ritter’s notion
that the ‘pectus' is the ‘pectus’ of the
hearer, which is filled with this super-
fluous stuff, and soon lones it, is intelli-

gible‚ but difficult to reconcile with tho

use of ‘manare.’]

340. Neu pransae Lamiae]
were hags,
children.

341. Centuriae seniorum] This lan-
guage is taken from the elassifieation of
the people by Servius Tullius (Livy, i.
43). The grave seniors like no poeti-y
that has not something profitable and
instructive in it. The Ramnes were one
of the three centuries of equites ‘which
Romulus formed (Livy, i. 13). They
are mentioned in opposition to the ‘ cen-
turiae seniorum,' as young men to old.
[They represent the equites of Home’s
day, as it seems.]

343. Omne tulit pmwtum] ‘ He carries
every vote.’ See Epp. ii. 2. 99 n. ς and
as to the Sosii see Epp. i. 20. 2 n.

353. Quid erqo est] ‘ What are we to
say then?' The expression occurs in
Cicero's speech pro P. Quintio, c. 18.

354. scriptor—librarius] A copier of
books. See Epp. ii. 2. 511.

‘ Lamiae '
ogresses, who devoured
