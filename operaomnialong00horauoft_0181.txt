ff 23. amatum] Bentley conjectures
’ ‘damnatum’ lest there should be any

a do not think there can be any doubt. The
feminine form ‘ Ilios' occurs in Epod. xiv.

34. ducere nectar-is] Many MSS. have
‘discet-e: and Porphyrion explains it, “as-
suescere saporibus nectaris-’² But ‘suc-
cus ' means juice‚ not flavour, and to that
sense ‘ducere' is well suited. The same
mistake appears in some of the MSS. in
ovid (A. Am. iii. 353) :—

“ — telorum ducere jactus
Ut sciat.'’

Dillenbr„ among others, has ‘discere ’ [and
Keller] 1 do not like it at all, in the face
especially of the very common use os ‘dn—
cere,’ in this sense of quaffing. So the
Greeks used ἕλκειν and πᾶν, both of which
occur in one verse of Euripides (Cycl. 417),

ἔπαισέν τ’ ἄμυστιν ἑλκύσας.

35. quietis ordinibus—deorum] This
savours of the Epicureanism Horace had
learnt in early life ; “ deos didici securum
agere aevum? (S. i. 5. 101.) [‘Adscribi :'
the usual word for expressing addition to a
list or roll, as ‘ adscribere in civitatem or
civitati‚’ to enroll a man as a citizen]

40. Priami—busto] Priam had no tomb
according to Virgil (Aen. ii. 557), but we
need not qnarrel with Horace for that.
The whole plain of noy, sa Dillenbr„
was in a sense his tomb. Efeztm repre-
sents Aegisthus as leaping on her fnther'.
