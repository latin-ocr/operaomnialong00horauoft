Quid valeant humeri. Cui lecta potenter erit res,

Nec facundia deseret hunc nec lucidus ordo.
Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor,
Ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici,
Pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat ;
Hoc amet, hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor.
In verbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis,
Dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum
Reddiderit junctura novum. Si forte necesse est
Iudiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,
Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis
Continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter;
Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si
Graeco fonte cadent, parce detorta. Quid autem
Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum
Virgilio Varioque Ῥ Ego cur acquirere pauca
