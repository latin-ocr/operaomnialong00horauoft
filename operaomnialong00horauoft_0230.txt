194 HORATII FLACCI

Te Liber et, si laeta aderit, Venus
Segnesque nodum solvere Gratiae
Vivaeque producent lucernae,
Dum rediens fugat astra Phoebus.

[‘ Cornua' is ‘strength,’ ‘courage‚’ commentatore say. It seems to mean the

‘power to attack or to resist ’ (Ovid, Am.
iii. 11. 6). Ritter observes that Bacchus
{ZfZ32'⁹2‘3“³1:“1'{;u1¹1³13¹s¹'³{}' {³ ²3⁰¹3‘1332‘231'23 ¹¹23?
dulcisque tuis e cornibus uva Pendeat.’]

19. Post te] “ Quis post vina gravem
militiam aut pauperiem crepat ?'' ’ (C. i. 18.
5.) As to ‘apices,’ see C. i. 34. 14.

22. Seynesque nodum solvere Gratiae]
As Horace represents the Graces naked,
¹ nodum’ cannot signify the zone, as some

bond that nnites them. They are always
represented with their arms intertwined.
Acron says, ‘ Segnesque nodum solvere-
hoc est quae nodum non solvunt quo con-
nexae sunt. Propterea hoc dictum est quia
qui fida inter se gratia junguntur nunquam
resolvuntur ab amicitiae fide, unde et ipsae
Gratiae conjunctis inter se manibus fingun-
tur.” As to the next line, see C. iii.

CARMEN XXII.

Horace on some occasion thought fit to dedicate a pine in his garden to Diana, and
his commentators have suggested various reasons and occasions for his doing so. One
thinks it may have been when he first had possession of his farm, which enables him to
fix the date of the ode ς another that he had had an escape from the attack of a boar pig 5
the French editors have settled it was on the arrival of news that one of his mis·
tresses had been safely delivered of a child; “for the ode,'’ says Dacier, “has all the air
of a thanksgiving,’‘ of which suspicion J ani says ‘ valde arridet‚’ while all other conjec-
turers, in his opinion, ‘ multa nugantur-³ Whether his ‘ nugae' surpass the ‘ nugae' of
others or not, the reader will judge for himself. But it may safely be prouounced to be
the idlest sort of trifling which thus attempts to fix causes from such impenetrable data,
and turns the edge of a pretty trifle like this by forcing it into matter of fact. How
long the child born on this memorable occasion survived its birth, or how many such the

numerous mistresses of the poet (une de ses maitresses !) bore him, we are not informed

by the sagacity of Sanadon and Dacier. The dedication of trees to particular divinities
was not uncommon. Fea quotes an inscription in which Τ. Pomponius Victor vows a
thousand large trees toSilvanus: :ru ME MEOSQUE annuens nonan sIS‘rlro naon!

ARGUMENT.

Diana, who protectest the mountains and woods, and deliverest women in childbirth, w
thee I dedicate this pine‚ and will offer thee the sacrifice of a boat. ·

Momm custos nemorumque, Virgo,

Quae laborantes utero puellas

Ter vocata audis adimisque leto,
Diva triformis,
