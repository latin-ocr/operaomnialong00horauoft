⁸ fundus' here, and in Epp. i. 2. 47, may
mean a town-house. The advice is, that
if oue of the man's ‘coheredea' who is
old, and by a bad cough shows he is
near hia end, expresses a wish to have an
estate or house which forms part of his
share, bc should declare himself delighted

to make it over to him for a nomina} price,
a single ‘sestertius’ This would he a bold

rosity on his part would be remembered in
the siclt man's will. ‘Addicere ' is a legal

claration of him who sells as to the transfer
of the thing to the buyer '’ (Long, Ver-r. ii.
2. 32). It was used in private burg-ains as
here, and at public auctions it was the word
used for declaring who was the purchaser.
Suetonius, speaking of Caesar’s fondness
for Servilia, and his rich presents to her,
says (Caesar, c. 50), “super alias donationes
amplissima praedia ex auctionibus hastae
(ei) nummo addixit? where ¹ minimo ’ has
been proposed for ‘numium' and appears
in some MSS.

SATIRE VI.

a.u.c. 724.

Whenever Horace touches on matters personal to himself he does it with humour and
feeling. He is also very skilful in telling a story or representing a dramatic tableau.
'l'he fable of the town and country mouse could hardly have been better told than it is
here. The apostrophe to the country beginning ⁶ Ο rus, quando ego te adspiciam,’ and the
‹30qu between a town and country life, are among his most natural touches 3 and the
ht upon him, is
muaged with delicacy towards his patron, wmle it shows in a very ew words the mix-
tm of pride and annoyance which the feeling against him caused. He outlived this
feeling, as'he tells us in C. iv. 3. 16 (see Introduction); but at this time it perhaps
caused him a good deal of pain ς for he was not a man of vigorons temperament,
capable of disregarding a jealousy he did not deserve, and he had none of the ambition
which overleaps the jealousy it erentes. He had no desire to be mixed up with public
affairs: and if he songht Maecenas, it was in gratitude for his kindness and for the
pleasure of his society, and that of the circle to which his patronage introduced him,
When therefore vulgarpeople appealed to him as the depository of state secreta and in
the great man's confidence, it disturbed and annoyed him probably, as he here with
evidens· sincerity professes.

The historical references in this Satire mark the date of the composition pretty accu-
„ rately. It appears (v. 53) that the Daci were in arms against the Romam. There is an

allusion to the Daci (C. iii. 6. 14). It was in the year, A.U.c. 724, that M. Crassus
was sent against them. (Dion Cass. li. 23.) In the same book (c. 3 sq.) Dion re-
lates that the veterans who had fought at Actium, having beensent back to Italy, were
discontented and broke out into mutiny because they had no reward. Iu the middle of
the winter of ΔΑΜ). 723—724, Angustus came from Asia to Brundusium for the pur-
pose of quelling this mutiny, and gave money to some, and to the others he distributed
land in those districts which had been favourable to Antonius. This distribution had ἱ
been promised but not made when this Satire was written (v. 55). In the absence of
Augustus, when he went against Antonius and till his return to Rome, Maecenas, at first
singly and afterwards in conjunction with M. Agrippa, was deputed by Augustus to
exercise those powers in the city and in Italy which he himself would have exercised
had hebeen there. (Dion Cass. li. 3 ς l'liny xxxvii. C. 1. 4.) This too is referred to in
v. 38 : all of which goes to indicate the beginning of A.U.c. 724 as the time when this
