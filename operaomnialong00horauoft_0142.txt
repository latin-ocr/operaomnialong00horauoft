, HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

The way to live, Licinius, is neither rashly to tempt nor cowardly to sear the storm.
The golden mean secures a man at once from the pinching of poverty and the cnvy
of wealth. The loftiest objects fall soonest and most heavily. In adversity or pro-

sperity the wise man looks for change.

Storms come and go. Bad times will not

always be bad. Apollo handles the lyre as well as the bow. In adversity show thyself

brave, in prosperity take in sail.

REcTIUS vives, Licini, neque altum
Semper urgendo neque, dum procellas
Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo

Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem 5
Diligit tutus caret obsoleti
Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda

Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus et celsae graviore casu

10

Decidunt turres feriuntque summos

Fulgura montes

5.] Horace's language comes near to that
of Aristotle (Polit. iv. 12), καὶ σώζονται
δ’ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν οὗτοι (οἱ μέσοι) μάλιστα
τῶν πολιτῶν· οὔτε ’γὰρ αὐτοὶ τῶν ἀλλο-
τρίων ὥσπερ οἷ πένητες ἐπιθυμοῦσιν οὔτε τῆς
τούτων ἕτεροι. Aristotle quotes a maxim
of Phocylides to the same effect, πολλὰ
μέσοισιν ἄριστα· μέσος θέλω ἐν πόλει εῖναι.
That every virtue is a mean between two
vices is a doctrine laid down in the Ethics
of this author (Nic. Eth. ii. 7), and Cicero
(De Off. i. 25) says “Nunquam enim iratus
qui accedit ad poenam mediocritatem illam
tenebit quae est inter nimium et 1111111111.υ

6. obsoleti] That which has gone out of
use ; therefore old and decayed.

9. Saepius] Burmann’s conjecture (on
ovid, Heroid. xiv. 39), ‘saevius‚' is strongly
defended by J ani, who thinks ‘ saepius ’
much too weak, especially for so elaborate
a poem. Sanadon adopts ‘ saevius' as
agreeing better with ‘graviore easu,' which,
he says, would have been ‘ frequentiore
casu ’ had the true reading been ‘saepius.’
Dacier is opposed to him, and so are the
M SS.‚ the Scholiasta, and every edition
earlier than the eighteenth century (Bur-
mann edits ‘saepius’)‚ and all the editors
of·⁸ this except Fea. Cunningham approves
of ‘saevius' only, as it would seem, be-
cause Bentley does not, and yet Bentley
carries the system of correcting on aes-

thetical principles far enough. The same
editors follow one another 111 reading ‘ex-
celsae' for ‘et celsae?

The illustrations used 111 this stanza
are frequently met with. A passage of
Lucretius’ fifth book (1116—1133) may be
compared with this ode. In the sixth book
(v. 42 sq.) he asks,

“ Altaque cur plerumque petit locu, pluri-
Mdilizglll{seihs summis vestigia cernimus
ignis ’³
The oldest passage containing this illustra·
tion is in Herodotus (vii. 10), ὁρᾷς τὰ
ὑπερέχοντα ζῶα ὡς κεραυνοῖ ὁ θεὸς οὐδὲ
ἐᾷ φαντάζεσθαι, τὰ δὲ σμικρὰ οὒδέν μιν
κνίζει· ὁρᾷς δὲ ὡς ἐς οἰκήματα τὰ μέγιστα
αιέὶ καὶ δένδρεα τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἀποσκήπτει τὰ
βέλεα· φιλέει γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα
ἔέέἷα κολούειν. Ovid says (Rem. Am.
“Suinma petit livor, perflant altissima
811ΞὲΫέ petunt dextra ful-mina missa
ov1s.”

And Claudiam (in Rufinum, i. 21),

“— non ad culmina rerum
Injustos crevisse queror : tolluntur in
altum
Ut lapsu graviore ruant.’'
