CARMINUM ΙΙ. 20.

135

Me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus et ultimi
Noseent Geloni, me peritus
Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor. 20
Absint inani funere neniae
Luctusque turpes et querimoniae3
Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
Mitte supervacuos honores.

‘⁴ Multa Dircaeum levat aura cycnum.’'
(C. iv. 2. 25.)

The bird therefore that Horace means can-
not be mistaken. virgil (Ec. ix. 27) has—

“ Vare tuum nomen—
Oantantes sublime ferent ad sidera cycni.’'

Plato (Rep- x.) speaks of the spirit of Or·
pheus taking the shape of a swan: ἰδεῖν
μὶν γὰρ ἔφη ψυχὴν τήν ποτε 'omens

ἶ = γενομένην κύκνου βίον αἱρουμένην. On the

Hyper-borenna, see Muner (Dorians ii. 4, §
6). -Ρὶηὼιι- calls them ’Λπόλλωνος θερά-
ποντες (Ol. iii. 16), to whom they sacrificed
assas (Eyth. x. 34). There was a mystery

to the distant regions of the
ΜΗ), to which Pindar says no man ever

hund the way by land or sea:

ναυσὶ δ’ οὔτε πεζὸς ἰὼν ἃν εὕροις
, ἐς ’Ὑπερβορέων &yon θαυματὰν ὁδόν.

And, though Perseus went there, it was
'5⁰¹ the divine help, with which the poet

y observes any thing may be done.
did not however neglect the Muses 2-—

Μοΐσα δ’ οὐκ ἀποδαμεῖ

qaum ἐπὶ σφετέροισι, rma δὲ χοροὶ

εν
avp'gqre καὶ καναχαί τ’ αὐλῶν δονέονται.

They were a happy race, ἀνδρῶν μακάρων
{miracu a sacred family, ἱερὰ γενεά, free from
(eud 'fig-Q 26 and war. Compare Pliny

. . iv. .

19. peritur} Here the meaning is ‘ in-
sta-ueta& as ‘juris perItus’ is one instructed
and skilled in the law. Horace means that
barb-rous nations will become versed in his

writin
haps tffi full sentence. But why he should
class those who drank of the waters of the
Rhone (of which many Romans might
drink also) with the barbariam mentioned
is not easy to understand. As far as 1 can
see, the adaptation of the name to the
metre is the only way of accounting for it.
By Hiber is probably meant the Caucasian
people named lberi. [But he may mean
the Iberi of Spain, who were Romanized
like the natives on the Rhone in the Roman
Provincia.] The mode of expression for
the inhabitants of a country, aa those who
drink of their national river, is repeated
twice (C. iii. 10. 1) :

“Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyee;”
and (C. iv. 15. 21),
“ Non qui profundum Danubium bibunt.''

: ‘mei peritus me discet’ is per·

It may be observed here, as well as any
where else, how frquntly Horace ends the
third verse of the Alcaic stanza with a word
that belongs immediately to the last word
of the stanza. The remark is Dillenbr.’s,
and it is worth attending to. The Daci
were not finally subdued till the reign of
Trajan. But see C. ii. 9. 23 n.

24. supervacuos] The prose-writers be-
fore Pliny used the form ‘supervacaneus'
Forcellini quotes one passage from Cicero
(de Nat. Deor. i. 33), in which he says some
editions have ‘super-vacuus.5 All modern
editions have the other form. [As to ab-
sence of lamentation over a death which
lest no body for interment, compare the
verses of Ennius (Introduction).]
