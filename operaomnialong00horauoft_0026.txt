xxii INTRODUCTION.

twenty, it was in A.U.c. 709, the year before C. Julius Caesar was assas· ⁷
sinated. After that event Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to
Greece. Foreseeing the struggle that was before them, they got round
them many of the young men at that time studying at Athens, and
Horace was appointed a tribune⁷ in Brutus’ army, a high command, for
which he was not qualified. He went with Brutus into Asia Minor,
and finally shared his defeat at Philippi, A.U.C. 712. He makes humorous
allusion to this defeat in his Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the
battle he came to Italy, having obtained permission to do so, like many
others who were willing to give up a desperate cause and settle quietly
at home. His patrimony ⁸, however, was forfeited, and he seems to
have had no means of subsistence, which induced him to employ himself
in writing verses, with the view perhaps of bringing himself into notice⁹
rather than for the purpose of making money by their sale. It is not
impossible, however, that some of his earliest compositions were severe
personal satires and lampoons, written at the instigation of those who
were able to pay him for them. That the book of Epodes which we
possess does not contain all that he wrote in Archilochus’ vein, Ι think
is pretty certain 3 and the same I believe may be said of the books of
Satires. Probably his earliest efforts were more severe and licentious
than those which his judgment allowed him afterwards to publish,
though some of these are bad enough. With Archilochus and Lucilius
before him as models, and without the experience he afterwards gained,
his earliest productions may without difficulty be supposed to have been
such as in later life he would condemn. By some means he managed
to get a place as scriba¹ in the Quaestor’s office, whether by purchase
or interest does not appear. In either case we must suppose he cofi-
trived soon to make friends, though he could not do so by the course
he pursued without also making many enemies. His Satires are full of
allusions to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted, among other literary persons, with Virgil and
Varius, who about three years after his return (ΛΑΜ). 715) introduced
him to Maecenas, who was careful of receiving into his circle Brutus’
tribune, and one whose writings were of a kind that was new and un-
popular. He accordingly saw nothing of Horace for nine months after
his introduction (S. i. 6. 61). He then sent for him (ΛΑΜ). 716), and from
that time continued to be his patron and friend. There is nothing

⁹ Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 15, 11. 4) and Franke (Fast. Hor. p. 20) reject this notion,
supposing Horace to mean in the passage on which it is founded (Epp. ii. 2. 51) that
poverty made him desperate and careless of consequence& but that when he became

comparatively rich he lost that stimulus.
