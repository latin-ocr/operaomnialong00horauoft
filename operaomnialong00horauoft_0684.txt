HORATII FLAC CI

Hunc ego non alio djetum prius ore Latinus
Vulgavi fidicen 3 juvat immemorata ferentem
Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector

Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus?
Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor

Impensis coenarum et tritae munere vestis ;

Non ego nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor

Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor:

“ Princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos
Deduxisse modos.”

Forcellini only mentions one other ex-
ample of ‘immemoratus' from Ausonius.
-. ‘ Ingenuis ' Orelli thinks is opposed to
‘libertinis‚’ of which class Horace's chief
detractors‚ the grammarians, were. (See
below, v. 40n.) But Horace may have
had many friends who, like his father, were
not ‘ingenui’ in this sense. (See S. i. 6.
6 n.) Ι think he means candid or uncor-
ru ted.

12215. ingratus] 1 suppose he means that
the reader is ungrateful who receives gra-
tiflcation from his poems at home, and yet
abuses them abroad 3 so that ‘ingratus ' in
fact belongs to the second clause as well as
‘ iniquus? The reason Horace gives is,
that he does not go about secking the good

keeps himself to the company of respect-
able authors, listening to their writings
and getting them to listen to his own.
The language is taken from the notion of

imitated this (S. i. 54)=

“ — Calidum scis ponere sumen :
-Scis comitem horridulum trita donare
lacerna.'’

39. auditor et ultor] These words are
recipi-ocal. The man who listens to a prosy
recitation has his revenge when he recites
in return. Here it is meant in a good-
humoured way. Juvenal’s first Satirc
begins “ Semper ego auditor tantum?

40

nunquamne reponam ?’' As to the prac-
tice of recitation among friends and in
public, see C. ii. 1, Ine„ and S. i. 4. 7311.
[Possibly he may mean ‘I who listen to
and defend good writers.’]

40. Grammaticus ambire tribus] Those
who made a profession of literature were
called ‘literati,' ‘eruditi,’ or ‘grammatici.'
The last name was applied principally to
those who kept schools or gave lectures, of
whom there were a great many at this
time at Rome. Inferior writers would
give a good deal for their favourable opi-
nion, which would help their books into
demand among their scholars. Suetonius
has given a short notice of the principa}
teachers, of whom he says the first was
Crates of Mallos (a city of Cilicia), who
was sent on an embassy to the senate by
Attalus, king of Pergamum, between the
second and third Punic wara. He broke
his leg, and during the oonflnement this
accident caused he gave lectures, ἀκρυά·
σεις, which example was followed b
others. At first, Suetonius says, they too
the works of deceased writers and eom-
mented upon these. Afterwards they
wrote themselves and descanted upon
their own works, then upon those of their
contemporaries. The name applied pro-
bably to all who kept schools, even for
children, in which grammar (that is, lite-
rature either Greek or Roman, ancient or
modern) was taught, as opposed to the
teachers of rhetoric, music, Soc. But there
were others whose lectures were attended
by youths who had left school and by ,
grown up persons. Some of them, Sueto-
nius says, made a great deal of money.
Those that he mentions were with few
exceptions freedmen. (See above v. 32 n.)
Horace speaks of the Grammatici again
(A. P. ¹78). ‘ Pulpitum ’ meant any raised
platform from which speeches were deli-
vered. Here it applies to that from which
the teachers delivered their lectures.
