Leave the hagie Muse for a little while, and thou shalt return to her when thou hast
finished the historian's task, Ο Pollio! advocate, senator, conqueror! Even now I
seem ιο hear the trumpet and the clai-ion, the flashing offirma, and the voices of chiefs,
and tim whole world subdued but the stubborn heart of Catu. The gods of Africa have
offered his victors’ grandsons on the tomb of J ugurtha. What land, what waters are

not stained with our blood?

But stay, my Muse, approach not such high themes-

Mon-mr ex Metello consule civicum
Bellique causas et vitia et modos
Ludumque Fortunae gravesque
Principum amicitias et arma
Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus, 5
Periculosae plenum opus aleae,

Res ordinaris grande munus
Cecropio repetae cothurno,

l. uotum ex Metello comle] The
fixmdntion of‘the civil wars is here laid in
tho coalitiou of Caesar, Pompey, and
Crassus, which took place in the consul-
ship of Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer and
L. Afianius, asne. 694, uc. 60. But the
civil war did not break out till a.u.c. 704,
Rc. 50, when Caesar and Pompey came to
their final rupture. Cruqnius supposes
Q„ Caecilius Metellus Numidicus to be the
consul referred to. His consulship was in
the year 645, Β. c. 109, the third year of
the Jugurthine war, which as leading to
the civil war of Marius and Sulla he
emaiders the foundation of the mischiefs
rdet-red to bv Pollio. But such was not
the subject of his history, which was con-
fined to those civil commotions of which he
himself had been witness, as the Scholiast
Porphyrion sayS, “In translatione bellorum
civilium Pollio historiam belli civilis a con-
sulatu Lentuli et Mamerti coepti altius
&petit i.e. a Metello Celere et a L. Afranio
uelli?

(‘ Mamerti ' is a mistake for ‘ Mar-
Lentulus and Marcellus were con-

’ suls the year after the breach between
· Caesarand Pompey,a.u.c.¹705). [‘Mod0s,'

⁸ prosaic word, perhaps means ‘eventse

‘Ludumque Fortunae? see C. iii. 29. 5o.]

4. Principum amicitias] The alliance
of Caesar and Pompeius.

5. Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus]
See C. i. 2, Introduction, and v. 31 n.

’ ⁴ · Bentley conjectures ‘tincta' for ‘unctae

“multa argutans,'' as Jani says. In Ep.

xvii. 31, we have

“Quantum neque atro delibutus Hercules
Nessi cruore‚”

where the Scholiast says ‘delibutus ' is
equivalent to ‘ unctus? ‘ Cruoribus’ sa-
vours of the Greek. So Aesch. Supp. 262 ε
παλαιῶν αἱμάτων μιάσμασιν.

6. Periculosae plenum opus aleae] Pollio
had been faithful to C. Julius Caesar, but
ast-er his death had sided rather with M.
Antonius than Augustus ς and therefore,
when Augustus had put an end to his rival,
and had the entire power in his own hands,
it wasa bold and difficult task that Pollio
had under-taken. It does not appear, how-
ever, that he involved himself in any dif-
ficulty with Augustus, for he died in his
eightieth year at his villa at Tusculum,
A.U.c. 758, Am. 4. Cremutius Cordus, the
historiari who was capitally condemned
under Tiberius for having called Brutus and
Cassius the last of the Romans, appealed in
his defence to the impunity with which
Pollio had expressed his sentiments (Tac.
Ann. iv. 34). Pollio’s history may have
been written with impartiality, and Augus-
tus was not jealous and could afford to be
otherwise. [Ritter says that these words
refer to the events contained in Pollio’s
history, and he appeals to Tacitus, Hist. i.
2: ‘ Opus adgredior opimum mnibus: duc]

7. incedis per iym] ‘ Thou art treading.
on ashes that cover a smouldering fire, like.
the ashes at the mouth of a volcano, cool,
