HORATII FLACCI

Gausape purpureo mensam pertersit, et alter
Sublegit quodcunque jaceret inutile quodque
Posset coenantes offendere, ut Attica virgo

Cum sacris Cereris procedit fuscus Hydaspes

Caecuba vina ferens, Alcon Chium maris expers.

Hic herus: Albanum, Maecenas, sive Falernum
Te magis appositis delectat, habemus utrumque.”

When the litter is cleared away 81111 the
table wiped, two slaves, one from the
East and named after his native river,
the other 8 Greek, walk in with two
‘amphorae,' 0118 of Caecuban, the other
of Chian wine. They are represented as
entering in a solemn and stately man-
ner, like the κανηφόροι who carried the
baskets in procession at the festival of
Ceres. (S. i. 3. 11 n.) On the Caecuban
and other Italian wines here named, see
C. i. 9. '7 n. Pliny (xxiii. 1) says that
Caecuban wine was not grown in 1118 day,
and that the Setian, which was highly
'valued by Augustus, was very rare. There
are some good wines made in the Levant
now, such as those of Thera (Santorin)
and Tenedos.

15. Chium maris expers] Strange as it
is, salt water was mixed with the sweet
wines imported from the Greek isles. In
the treatises de Re Rust. of Columella (xii.
21. 37) and of Cato (xxiv. 105) directions
are given as to the proportion that was
advisable of salt water to wine. Colu-
mella directs that the water be boiled
down to about a third part, and that a
‘ sextarius ³ of water be added to an ‘ am·
phora' of wine, which is about the pro-
portion of a pint to six gallons. 801118, 118
sayS, add even two or three ‘ sextarii‚’ 81111
118 would like to do the same if it could
be donc without betraying a saline taste.
Cato has given receipts for cooking (as
it is called) native wiues so as to imi-
tate the Greek, and salt water forms an
ingredient. He says, speaking of one of
these compounds: “ non erit deterius quam
Coum.'’ It 18 88111 that the practice arose
out of the circumstance of 8 slave, who
had stolen some of his master's wine, fill-
3510?ss ‘tvasshcissgffiffizzflfflx &siffis
flavour. An accident is said to have led
10 8 similar improvement in the manu-
facture of a certain kind of beer at New-
haven, on the Sussex coast, which goes by
the name of Tipper ale. Horace perhaps

refers to this practice, 81111 means that the
wine had not been prepared, and was of-
inferior quality. Other critics suppose
that this pretended Chian had in fact
never crossed the seas, but had been con-
cocted at home 3 but this, Ι think, is

doubtful. Orelli and most of the com· ,

mentators adopt the first opinion after the
Scholiasts. Persius (vi. 39 11.) z

“ —— postquam sapere urbi
Cum pipere et palmis venit nostrum hoc
mans expers?

where ‘ sapere maris expers’ perhaps
means a learning without salt, that is,
without wit. [Doederlein takes ⁸ maris
expers’ to mean ‘ein castrat? and he
understands ‘maris expers' in Persius in
a like sense, ‘this unmanned or unmanly
philosophy.' It is possible that his inter-
pretation of Persius may 118 right ; but
he will not easily convince us that he has
understood Horace.] In Plautus (01118111.
1. 1. ’76) Ρ11881110111118 says: “ Ei est nomen
lenae Multibiba atque Merobiba.” To
which Palinurus answers: “ Quasi tu
lagenam dicas ubi vinum solet Chium
esse,” as if Chian wine was always ‘me-
rum‚’ ‘ unmixed,' which may help to ex·
plain Horaee's meaning.

18. Divitias miseras] This exclamation
is drawn from Horace by his fricnd’s de-
881111131011, 111 whicth> ml? knewhNffidimm
wou see more or suc guage
than lies on the surface. There has been
nothing said hitherto to call forth par-
ticular remark; but the impression per-
haps conveyed by what Fundanius has
said was that of vulgar ostentation with-
out taste on the part of the host. [1 8111
inclined to accept Doederlein's interpreta-
tion of ‘Divitias miseras ς’ that wealth
brings trouble, because it is accompanied
with great display and consequent anxiety
to the possessor. He compares ‘misera
ambitio,' S. i. 6. 129, ‘and ‘misero cupi-
dine,' Epp. i. 1. 33.]
