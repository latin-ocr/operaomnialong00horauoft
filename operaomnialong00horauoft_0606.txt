570 HORATII FLACCI

same year with Vir-gil (A.U.c. 734), or very soon after. Ovid seems to imply that he
first came into notice when Augustus was made emperor, A.U.c. '727 (Trist. ii. 463 sq.),
“legiturque Tibullus Et placet et jam te principe notus erat.” And so the Epistle »
10 placed between these two dates. Any thing nearer cannot be arrived at, and this is
uncertain.

ALBI, nostrorum sermonum candide judex,
Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?
Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat,
An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,

1. sermonum] It is a matter of discus-
sion whether these ‘ sermones’ were the
Epistles or Satires, or both. The Satires
must have been published some time, and
some of the Epistles may have been written
and made known to Horace's intimate
friends. 1 think there can be no doubt the
word ‘sermones' applies (whether Horace
published them with that title or not) to
the Epistles as well as the Satires, and
whatever Tibullus had seen he approved,
which is all we can gather from the text.
Acron writes “Albius ille criticus fuit et
scriptor philosophiae.” By ‘criticus' he
probably meant ‘grammaticus’ (Epp. i. 19.
40 n.) ς but he is plainly wrong.

2. regione Pedana] See Introduction.

3. Cassi Parmensis opuscula] Parma
(Parma) was a town belonging to the Boii,
at the edge of the Macri Campi, in Cisal-
pine Gaul, on a river of the same name
which runs into the Po about twelve miles
north of the town. The Via Aemilia passed
through Parma. Cassius of Parma has
been referred to before on S. i. 10. 61,
where it was stated that the Scholiasts
had confounded him with the bad poet of
Etruria there mentioned. Cassius of Parma
was one of the murderers of C. Julius Cae-
sar (Velleius, ii. 87) and a ‘ tribunus mili-
tum’ in the army of Brutus aud Cassius. He
was therefore in all probability well known
to Horace. After following the fortunes of
Sex. Pompeius he joined Antonius, ou whose
side he fought at the battle of Aetiu‘m.
After the battle he retired to Athens, and
there he was put to death by order of Au·
gustus. Acron, after stating most of the
above particulam, which are confirmed by
the historian, says, “ Qu. Varus (or Varius,
as it is in the commentary of Porphyrion ς
Comm. Cruq. has Varus) ab Augusto missus
ut eum interficeret, studentem reperit ι et
perempto eo scrinium 011111 libris tulit. Unde
multi crediderunt Thyestem Cassii Parmen—
sis fuisse ι scripserat enim multas alias tra-
goedias.'' It has been supposed that L.
Varius, Horace’s friend, the dramatic and

epic poet, who wrote atmgedy called Thy-
estes, is the Qu. Varus of the Scholiasts,
and that they mean to affirm that he stole
it from Cassius. See C. i. 6. 8, and S. i. 5.
40.) But Estre suggests that Qu. Atius
Varus, to whom the sixth Eclogue of virgil
is addressed, aud who was a poet, was the
executioner of Cassius referred to by the
Scholiasts. A very elaborate treatise has
been written (by Weichert) respecting the
two Cassii, in which, besides establishing
the distinction between them, he produces
a few fragments which are supposed to be-
long to Cassius of Parma ; aud he attributes
tol him the epigram on Augustus, beginning
“ Quum primum istorum conduxit mensa
chomgum,” quoted by Suetonius in his life
(c. 70). What the ‘opuscula' Horace re-
fers to may have been we do not know, but
it is clear that he thought well of them.
Acron’s note on this person begins, “ Hic
aliquot generibus stylum exercuit : inter
quae opera elegiaca et epigrammata ejus
laudantur.” What confidence is to be
placed in this assertion, part of which at
least might easily be got from the text, we
cannot tell. Obbarius thinks Horace gave
a strong proof of his friendship for his old
{Zffffissfffinffszffi fflpffiggofflg
tus. But those quarrels had long been
forgotten.

4. silvas inter reptwre salubres] ‘Rep-
tare’ (frequentative of ‘ repere' ), which con-
tains the same root as ἕρπω, signifies to
saunter, or to go about quietly; and Lu-
cretius applies it to sheep grazing on downs
(ii. 317) :—

“ Nam saepe in colli tondentes pabula laeta

Lanigerae reptant pecudes, quo quamque

vocantes
Invitant herbae.’'

The woods are called ‘salubres' because
their shade protects from the heat of the
sun, as Cicero says (Cat. M. 0. 16) : “Ubi
enim potest illa aetas (senectus) aut cales-
cere vel apricatione melius vel igni, aut
