other be weak‚ as I think it is, and this
somewhat more to the purpose, that may
only prove it to be a more ingenious inter-
polation than the other, supposing both to
be invented by the copyists, which is not
unlikely. F. V. ffitzsche (in Aristoph.
Thaem. p. 13), quoted by wustemann in
his edition of Heindorf's Notes, and by
Orelli in his excursus on this , says
that Mavortius, a very early editor, found
an hiatus after ‘fugio’ in his copies, aud
absurdly filled it up with the words ‘rabi-
osi tempora signi? [But Orelli observes
that the recension of Mavortius only ex-
tended to the Odes and Epodes, not to the
Sermones and Epistohe] 1 have followed
the judgmeut of such scholars as Gesner,
Doering, Heindorf, Pea, Orelli, in receiving
the new reading, which is undoubtedly
nester than the other, but without much
saith in the verse having been so written by
Horace. [A Gotha MS. has ‘Campum
lusitque erig-onem: where the copier in-
tended to write ‘lusuque’ mntem] ‘Lu-
sum trigonem' was a game of ball only
mentioned elsewhere by Martial. The
players, as the name implies, were three in
number, and stood in a triangle. Their
skill appears to have been shown in throw-
ffidm catchmg· the bau with the lest

“Sic palmam tibi dc trigone nudo
Unctae det favor arbiter coronae ς
Nec laudet Polybi magis sinistras.”
(Mart. vii. 7 2.)

An unskilful player is represented as ‹nteh-

“ Captabit tepidum dextra laevaque trigo-

Ιωιέξῐιιῖείῐ exceptas ut tibi saepe pilas.”
(Ibid. xii. 83.)

Dillenbr. doubts whether this game was
played in Horace's day. It is not men-
tioned earlier than Martial. Becker, from
whom (Gallus, Exc. ‘on the Games’) the
above account is taken, does not refer to
this passage of Horace. From the above
passage of Marfial (vii. 72), Bentley pro-

posoe to read ‘ nudum' in place of ‘lusum‚’

thereby (for the sake, as usual, of a mere
vei-bal conaepondence between passages
