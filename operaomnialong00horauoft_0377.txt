does the same with the women, as Torren-

What Horace says ot' him is this: lf he
chose to be liberal to that extent that his
means and good sense would with·
out any extravagant munificence, he might
give to the needy and not injure or dis„
grace himself, that is, he would gain credit
by it; whereas he is content to pride him-
self on this one merit, that he does not
meddle with married women. ‘ Hoc’ (v.
53) is ‘on this account,' and ‘se’ is go·
vei-ned by each of the three verbs. [⁸ noe’
refers to what he is supposed to say. ‘ He
prides himself on this? Some critice sup-
pose the second ‘hoc' to be the aecus·-
