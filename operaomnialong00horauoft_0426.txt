death?” “'Well‚' says 118,ς ‘but my colleague' is a step lower than I.” “Suppose
118 1s3 does that make you a Paullus or a Messalla? He at any rate has stout lungs,
and that' s what we likess’

A word now about myself, the freedmau' s son, with which they are all taunting me now
because Ι am a friend of yours, Maecenas, as once they did because 1 had a tribune’s
command. This they might perhaps envy me with some reason ς but not the other,
for you are ever careful in your choice of ffiends, and hate low flattery. It was not
luck that brought me to your notice: Virgil introduced me first, and theu Varius.
I came modestly into your presence. 1 made no boast of birth or wealth, but told
you who and what I was. You answered as usual briefly‚ dismissed me, and in nine
months sent for me again, and admitted me to your circle. Hereiu I am happy, that
my merit, not my birth, commended me to one so discerning. But if my faults are
not great, and if my friends are attached to me, Ι have to thank my father for that,
who would not send me to a country school, but brought me to Rome to be educated.
He spared no expense: 118 took me to school every day himself ς iu short, he preserved
me from vice and even the imputation of it. He would not have been ashamed if
after all Ι had been obliged to resort to his old trade for a livelihood, and Ι should
not have complained a bit. To him be all the praise and all my gratitude. N ever let
me be ashamed of such a father as that, or say, as so many do, it was not my fault that
my father was not born a freeman. My language and views are very different from
this; for let who will choose new parents to suit their pride, Ι am content with mine ς
and though others may think me mad to say so, you will judge me wise, I know, for
declining a load 1 am not used to bear. 1 should have to enlarge my means 3 to bow
to a host of people ς to pay attendants to walk with me; to get more slaves and
horses ς to hire carriages. As it is I may ride to Tarentum, if I-like, 011 8 common
mule, with my portmanteau behind, and no one calls me shabby as they do you,
Tillius, most noble senator and praetor, when you go travelling with your five slaves
aud utensil behind you. I can go where 1 like by myself, about the maa-ket, and
circus, and forum in the evening, and then go home to my simple 111881 and poorly
furnished dining-room, and then to bed, to sleep undisturbed. Ι 118 till late writing
and reading, aud then take a stroll, or go and play till I am tired, then to bathe, and ἴ
then to lunch lightly and lounge at home. Could I live more happily than this ir
my father and his father and all my relations had been quaestore Ρ

the legend, which was familiar to men of
learning, and perhaps believed by many.

the time he wrote his book on Roman An-
tiquities (which was published in the year
'7 Rc.) opinions were divided ou the sub-
