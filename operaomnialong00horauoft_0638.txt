37. Sed postquam2 vietor violens]
Bentley, not liking ‘ vidlens ' in this posi-
tion, has changed ‘vietor' into ‘ victo’
{vithout authority, and put ‘violens’ be-
ore it.

39. potiore metallis] The ‘vectigalia’
from mines (‘metalla’) were very con·
siderable at this time.

[40. improbus] ‘ Improbus' corresponds
to ‘ serviet aeternum? ‘ He carries a
master in consequence of his greediness,
and will be a slave for ever.' Ritter has
‘ vehet,’ perhaps the better reading.]

42. ut calceus olim] See S. i. 3. 31 n.
‘Olim’ is used indefinitely, as in S. i. 1.
25, “ut pneris olim dant crustula blandi
Doctores.” See C. ii. 10. 1¹7 n. ‘ Urere’
means ‘ to gall?

[44. Laetus] There is an hypothetical
force in ‘laetus‚' as Ritter says: ‘ if yon
are content with your condition, you will
live like a wise man.']

48. Tortam digna sequi] Acron says,
“Qui magis vinci debet: quoniam vinci
est trahi nou trahere.” I think this gives
the right sense, and that the metaphor is
taken from a prisoner led with a rope
round his neck by his captor, or [a beast
led by a rope. See J uv. S. xii. 5. ‘ Tor-
tus: ‘intortus‚’ is a usual epithet of a

‘ Opes meas,’ ‘ all that

50

rope. Virg. Aen. iv. 575.

49. Haec tibi dictabam The imperfect
tense is generally used in letters instead
of the present, because the action is past
to the person receiving the letter. As to
‘ dictabam? see S. i. 10. 92 n. The Fanum
Vacunae was about three miles from the
confluence of the Digentia. and the Anio
close to the modern town, Bocca Giovanc.
“ Vacuna has been thought by some com-
mentators to be the goddess of leisure.
Lilius Giraldus says it is synonymous
with Minerva, Varro with Victoria. Τὴθ
opinion of the last seems confirmed by
the following inscription found near the
temple :—-

nff. CAESAR. VESPASIAIWS.
AVG. PONT. MAx. ΤΒΙΒ. Por.
CAENSOR. AEDEM. VICTORIAE.
VETVSTATE. DILAPSAM.
SVA. IMPENSA.
BESTITVIT.

“A prostrate brick wau covered with
cernent, and the portion of a small eon-
duit, which supplied the temple with
water, were all that we could find of the
‘ fanum putre Vacunae ’ '' (Kelsall’s Clas-
sical Excursion from Rome to Alpino,
p. 21, London, 1821). vacum was ori-
ginally a Sabine goddess.
