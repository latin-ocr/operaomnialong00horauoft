of priority among the occupants of these
seats. Orelli (2nd ed.) doubts between
two interpretations· one that the speaker
is a senator, and therefore entitled to a
seat in the orchestra, while his colleague
is but an ‘‚eques ’and therefore 0311 only
sit m the fourteen benches; the other that
Novius has not reached the equestrian
rank which his colleague has. I incline
to think that the words are only used
figuratively. The early Commentators

> took them so, and did not think of the

theatre, from which however the metaphor
may be taken.

41. Hoc tibi Paullus et Messalla]

‘’Paullus was a cognomen, which appears
in several of the ‘ gentes;' but it is best
known in connexion with the Aemilia
gens, and the persons of L. Aemilius
Paullus, who fell at Cannae (C. i. 12), his
son the illustrious conqueror of Perseus,
and the younger Scipio Africanus, son of
the latter. The Messallae belonged to the
Valeria gens, one of the oldest in Rome.
This branch of the ‘gens' were highly
distinguished, but Horace introduces the
name probably out of compliment to his
friend Corvinus, for whom he wrote C. iii.
21. As to ‘ hoc,' in the sense of ‘propter
hoc,' see S. i. 46 n. The same person who
puts the question ‘tune Syr1‚ &c. ?' is here
supposed to rejoin, saying, that though
this worthy has a colleague a degree less
illustriousthan himself he need not think
himself a Paullus3 and besides, though
Novius be his inferior in 0110 way, 110 beats
him in strength of lungs, “and that is
what we like‚’' where the speaker ironi-
cally puts himself for the people. [‘ Sal
tem tenet hoc nos. 'eomp. Cicero de Off. i.
33, ‘populum contionibus tenere. ']

43. Concurrantque foro tria funera]
These would be public funerals, ‘funera
indictiva, at which the corpse of the de·
ceased was carried in 111-0005511111 from his
house, with the noise of trumpets and horns

50

and fifes3 and women (‘praeficae ⁹) singing
dirges,· and ‘mimi,' dancers and stage-
players, who recited passages suited to the
occasion, and sometimes acted the part of
ss‘iiffit‘ssss‘irffg'ZZ'effissiffefssffi} 3223&
the ancestors of the deceased, wearing
masks suited to each character 3 and then
the corpse on an open bier, which was
followed by the relations and friends all
dressed in black. They went thus in pro-
cession to the Forum, when the bier was
set down, and one of the relations pro-
nounced a funeral oration, after which the
body was taken up again, and the proces-
sion went on with the same noisy accom-
paniments to the place without the city
(intra-mura] burials were forbidden by the
twelve tables), where the body was first to
be burnt and then buried. (800 Beck.
Gallus, Exc. ‘Interment of the Dead. ’)
The idiom‘ magna sonabit' occurs S. i.
4. 43, ‘os magna sonatumm? [But
‘magna’ is an epithet of‘ funera? and the
sense is ‘sonabit quod cornua vincat? As
the comma is omitted in this verse, the
render may choose his own interpretation,
but he should not connect‘ magna ’with
‘.cornua .
48. 48Qu]od mihi pareret] See v. 25 n.
[⁴ Quia sim. ’Ritter.]

49. forsit] A few MSS. have ‘’foi-san,
but ‘forsit’ is in most. The oldest edi-
tions 1 have seen have all ‘sorsam’ Imm-
binus restored ‘forsit,' which is com·
pounded of* fors sit. ’ whether it occurs
elsewhere, or whether the in
which it 1s supposed to occur are correctly
copied, is doubted. Horace says it might
bep that peop ple had cause to grudge him
the honourable post of military tribune,
because he was not qualified for it; but no
oue could deny that he deserved the friend-
ship of Maecenas who was so particular
in choosing only the deserving. ‘Pi-ava
ambitione’ means low flattery, to which
