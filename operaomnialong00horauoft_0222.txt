OARMEN XVIII.

It was usual to offer sacrifice to Faunus at the beginning of spring, though the Fau-
nalia did not take place till the Nones of December. (See C. i. 4. 6 and 17.) This ode
is very elegant, especially the picture of rustic security and cheerfulness in the last two
stanzas. The confusion of the Greek Pan with the Latin god Faunus has been noticed

before and is well known.
ARGUMEN T.

Faunus, come with mercy to my fields and depart gentle to my young lambs, for Ι
sacrifice and pour libations to thee at the fall of the year. When thy Nones come
round the old altar smokes with incense 3 the flocks sport in safety, the oxen are at
rest, and the village is gay; the wood sheds its leaves, and the clown smites his

enemy, the earth, in the dance.

3. incedas abeasque] Faunus was not a
stationary divinity. He was supposed to
come in the spring and depart after the
celebration of his festival in December.
From ‘parvis alumnis’ we may suppose
this ode was written in spring (C. iii. 23.
7) [⁶ Alumnis’ may include the slave
children born on the farm. Ritter says.

“‚Faunus dum fugientes Nymphas rapido
cursu sequitur, agri segetem calcare et
alumnos arborum laedere potest.” Ritter’s

‘parvi alumni' are the small trees (vines,
perhaps, he means) lately p.lanted This
explanation 1s new, as far as pI know, but I
do not think that itis true. ]

5. Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno]
‘ Si ' is not hypotheticaL and the true read-

ing is ‘caditss not‘ cadet. ⁹—1 have not fol-
low ed the usual punctuation of this passage,
which makes ‘'fumat depcnd upon ‘si,’
with a comma at craterae, and a period
at ‘.'odore Horace claims the protection
of Faunus for his lambs ιιι the spring, on
the ground of his due observance of the
rites of December. ‘Pleno anno' means
at the end of the year, when the Faunalia
took place. , Horace here makes the wine-
cup the companion of Venus, as he made

‘Jocus’ in C. i. 2. 34. See also C. i. 30. 5
sqq. He uses both forms, ‘crater’ and
‘cratera.’ ‘ Vetus ara’ may be an old altar
Horace found on his farm when he came
into possession of it.
