GARMEN XXXI.

In AALG. '726 (25th October), Augustus dedicated a temple with a libi-ary attached,
which he haul built in honour of Apollo, on the Palatino hin, to commemorate his vic—

, *ary nt Aetium (Suet. Octuv. 29, Dion Cass. liii. 1). After the eeremonies of the day of

 

 

dedientim wne over, we may suppose Horace pntting in his own claim to the god’s
favour in this ode, in which he represents himself as offering a libation (whether in
—printe or at the temple is uncertain), and asking for that which according to Juvenal
(x. 356) should be the end of all prayer, ‘mens sana in corpore sano ! ’

ARGUMENT.

What aska the poet with bis libation of Apollo Ρ not cups, or herds, or gold and ivory,
or rich fields. Let those who may prune Calenian vines, and rich merchants drink
rich wine out of eups of gold, favourites of heaven, who traverse the deep in safety.
115 foed is the olive, the chicery, and mallow. Let me enjoy what 1 have, thou son
of Into, sound in body and mind, and let my age pass-with honour and the lyre-
