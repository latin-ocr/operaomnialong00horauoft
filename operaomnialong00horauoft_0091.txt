OARMEN XXIV.

A.u.0. ⁷30.

Jerome, in his edition of the Chronicles of Eusebius, places the death of Quintilius
Varus, the subject of this ode, in the first year of the 189th olympiad, that is A.U.c.
780 (cnutum, F. IL). This therefore fixes the date of the ode. Quintilius was born at
Quone, and was a neighbotu· and friend of Vix-gil, through whom it is probable Horace
made his acquaintance. He is referred to (according to the Scholiast who is probably
right) in the Epistle to the Pisos, v. 4⁴38 sqq., as a discerning critic ; and the language
there used shows that he was dead when it was written. The Scholiast Acron says, that
some supposed he was Virgil‘s brother, which notion arose plainly from the language
1101-oe ω in this ode. Servius also, on Virg. Ec. v. 20 (where he says some
suppo-eanphnia to be this Quintilius, whereas that eclogae was written about seven-
tm years before his death, and Daphnis plainly is intended for Caesar), calls him
⁶ cognatum Virgilii) But for this there is no wan-ant.

'Hie opinions that identify him with C. 3. and 18 of this book and Epode v. are
nofioed in the introductions to thooe odes.

ARGUMENT.

what boundsshallbe set to our grief for one sodear? Teach us a mournful strain,
Melpomene. Can it be that Quintilius, whose like Modesty, Jusfioe, Fidelity, and
'huth shall not behold again, is gone to his everlasting rest P Many is the good man
that monrns him, but none more truly than thou, virgil. ’Twas not for this thou
didst commit him to the care of Heaven. But in vain thou dost ask him back. The
lyre of Orpheus could not bring back the blood to the shadowy form which Mercury
hath gathered into hell. ’Tis hard to bear ι but patience makes that lighter which

no power can change.
QUIS desiderio sit pudor aut modus
Tam cari eapitis Ρ Praeeipe lugubres
Cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam pater
Vocem cum cithara dedit.

capitum vivunt, totidem studiorum millia: injuria cari.’]
