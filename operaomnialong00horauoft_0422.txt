Intentum veneri 3 tum immundo somnia visu

Nocturnam vestem maculant ventremque supinum.

Quattuor hinc rapimur viginti et milia rhedis,
Mansuri oppidulo quod versu dicere non est,
Signis perfacile est ε venit vilissima rerum
Hic aqua3 sed panis longe pulcherrimus, ultra

Callidus ut soleat humeris portare viator3

Nam Canusi lapidosus, aquae non ditior urna

87. Mansuri oppidulo] It appears pro-
bable that the road on which Trivicum
lay, entering Apulia about ten miles from
that town, passed through or near the
Apulian Asculum (Ascoli), and it is in
that neighbourhood that the little town
with the unrhythmical name, at which
the party stopped after Trivicum, is now
generally supposed to have stood. Equus
Tuticus is the place fixed upon by the
Scholiasts 3 but that town [was 011 8 road
from Beneventum to Aecae, a place which
lies many miles north of Trivicum]. It
may be assumed that Horace's nameless
town, which was small and inconvenient
in his time, has left no traces3 and of the
name we must be content to be ignorant.
[See Equus Tuticus, Dict. Geog.] ·

89. ultra] This is the reading of all the
known MSS. Aldus (1501) first intro·
duced ς11111·ο;’ 81111 a few editors-41.
Stephens‚ Muretus, Baxter, and others,—
have adopted it. Orelli says “ ‘ultro'
rectum sensum non praebet 3'' but ‘ ultro ’
signifies to a place further on, and that is
what Horace means, namely, to Canu-
sium. 1 do not go against the MSS„ but
¹ ultro ’ is the more regular word.

91. Nam Canusi lapidosus] In a plain
between the hills and the right bank of
the Aufidus, about twelve miles from the
mouth, stood the town of Canusium (Ca-
nosa), one of the ancient Greek settle-
ments of Apulia. This town and others
in Apulia (Venusia and Brundusium
among them), and in other parts of
Eastern Italy, were represented to have
been founded by Diomedes, when, after
the Trojan war, he was driven to 1110 coast
of Apulia, an'd hospitably entertained and
presented with land by king Daunus.
His name was retained by the islands
now called Tremiti, but by the ancients
Diomedeae. By whomsoever founded, Ca-
nusium and Argyrippa or Arpi are stated
by Strabo (vi. 283. Cas.) to have been the
two largest of the Greek cities in Italy,

and many remains among the ruins testify
to the former wealth of Canusium. Its
greatest splendour appears to have been
in the time of Trajan 3 and for its wealth
it suffered dreadfully at the hands of the
barbarians, and afterwards from the Sa-
racens. Among the ancient ruins may
be seen fragments of aqueducts, tombs,
amphitheatres, baths, milliary columns,
and an ancient gateway. The present
town stands on a height where the citadel
stood, and contains not above 300 houses.
“The medals of Canusium in silver and
bronze have the inscriptions KA. KAN'r.
ΚΑΝΤΣΙΝΩΝ, with a head of Hercules on
a vase and clusters of grapes” (Cramer,
Italy, ii. p. 292 n.). A supply of good
water was brought into this town by
Hadrian the emperor. Apulia was not
well watered (Epod. iii. 16 n.). The
turbid waters of the Aufidus must have
been unfit for drinking. The breed of
Canosa seems to be 85 bad as ever. Swin-
burne writes (i. 166): “We breakfasted
at an inn near the bridge, and regretted
our not having followed Horace’s example
in bringing a supply of bread from some
other place, for what we got here was as
brown as mahogany, and so gritty that it
set our teeth on edge to crunch it. The
friable incompact contextura of the stone
with which the millers ngnd their corn,
rather than the sand of the area where it
is trodden out, can alone have perpetuated
this defect in the Canusian bread for nine-
teen centuries. I believe these millstones
are of the soft concreted rock, which 0011-
511101οε 1110 greater part of their coast.’'

10 make ‘ditior’ agree with ‘ locus? ‘which
place, being not richer in water (than the

last) by a single pitcher, was built by brave- ²⁴

Diomedes? So Orellitakes it. Theconstruc·
