character, from which it never departs”
(Miiller, Lit. of Greece, p. 125). This
writer disputes the ordinary etymology of
the word eleg-y (ἔ ἔ λέγειν), though he takes
it to mean a strain of lament. He con-
siders the word to be of Asiatic origin,
being borrowed by the Ionic poets of Asia
Minor from their neighbmus The dates
above assigned to these early poets are
later than some have given them. I have
followed Miiller.

19. 40 n.

79. Archilochum proprio rabies] See
Epp. i. 19. 23 n.; Epod. vi. 13. “It is
vain to seek an etymology for the word
Iambus: the most probable suppositionis
that it originated in exclamations, ὀλολυγ-
μοί, expressive of joy. Similar in form are
θρίαμβος, the Bacchic festival processioa ;
διθύραμβος, a Bacchic hymn 5 and ἵθυμβος,
also a kind of Bacchic song '’ (Miiller, p.
133). The word, according to this writer,
“originally denoted nothing but the jest
and banter used at the festivals of De-
meter,'’ of whose worship Paros, the birth-
place of Archilochus, was next to Eleusis
the principal seat. From these festivals
therefore, the soenes of unrestrained rail-
lery and scurrilous jesting, Archilochus
may be supposed to have conceived his
iambics. The iambic trimeter is said to
have been invented by him (Plutarch de
Musica,‘-3c. 28), and likewise the trochaic
tetrameter, and other mensures particularly
described by Miiller. Of the two first hc

genius as the Parthenon or the statue of
the Olympio Jupiter. Nor can there be
any stronger proof of their perfection than
that metres said to have been invented
by Archilochus retained their currency
through all ages of Greek poetry; and that
although their application varied in many
ways, no material improvement was made
in their structure '’ (p. 136). Τ110 prin-

cipal Iambic writers who followed Archi- stringe

lochus were Simonides of AmorguS‚ a

younger contemporary of Solon, and
Hipponax of Ephesus (13.0. 540).

80. Hunc socci cepere pedem] In respect
to ‘ soccus’ and ‘cothurnus,’ as the cha-
racteristics of comedy and tragedy, see
Epp. ii. 1. 174 n. The metre most used
in the dialogue of the earliest Greek trage-
dies was the trochaic tetrameter, which
metre is used in many passages of the
Persae of Aeschylus. But the iambic tri-
meter appears to have been used by
Phrynichus. Aristotle (Poet. 4) calls it
μάλιστα λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων, and com-
paring it with the Epic he says (Rhet. iii.
8) ε τῶν δὲ ῥυθμῶν ὁ μὲν ἡρῷος σεμνὸς καὶ
λεκτικὸς καὶ ἁρμονίας δεόμενος, ὁ δ’ ἴαμβος
αὐτή ἐστιν ἡ λέξις ἦ τῶν πολλῶν· διὸ μά-
λιστα πάντων τῶν μέτρων ἰαμβεῖα φθέγ-
Ὑόνται λέγοντες. Horace’s ‘ natum rebus
agendis’ appears also to be au echo of
Aristotle's πρακτικόν 111 the following pas-
sage (Poet. 24) ε τὸ ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετ-
ρον κινητικά, τὸ μὲν ὂρχηστικόν, τὸ δὲ
πρακτικόν. Πρακτικόν means that the
metre suits the lang-uage of action. [Comp-
Cicero‚ Or. c. 57.] By ‘alternis ser-tuoni-
bus’ Horace means dialogue generally,
not those dialogues in which verse answers
to verse, στιχομυθία. When he says that
the iambic overcomes the noise of the
theatre‚ it may 110 that he refersv to the
clear intonation which that metre admits
of, or to its engaging the popular attention
from its adaptation to the understandings
of all. As to the modifications of tho
Iambic metre in the hands of the three
principal tragedians, see Mulier, Lit. Gr.
v. i. p. 317. The same writer has some
remarks on the adaptation of the iambic
trimeter to comedy, the correctness of
which may be disputed (v. ii. p. 13).

83. Musa dedit fidibus] 011 the con-
nexion of poetry with music and dancing,
and on Greek music in general, Miiller’s
History of Greek literature (i. 148 sqq.)
may be consulted. The earliest stringed
instrument was the tetrachord or four-
d cithara, which was improved by
Terpander, by the addition of three stringe,
