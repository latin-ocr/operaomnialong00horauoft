61. Atym· et fulgente decons arcu]

«ς · 'nnn seems to contradict the prayer in v.

833 bnt the bow of Apollo did not always
inqire dread. He is sometimes represented
with this unstrung at his back, and the
1510 and plectrum in his hands (C. ii. 10.
19); and it is uncertain whether he did not
ιο appear in the statue above referred to.
In some ancient rilievi and paintings
Apollo‘is represented as seated in the midst
of the nine Muses, who are all payiug at-
tention to him. Ausonius wrote an inscrip-
-flon (Idyll. xx.) for a group of the Muses,
in which Apollo appeared in the midst.
Such a group is seen on a sarcophagus in
the Giustiniani palace at Rome, given in
Hontfimcon's collection, vol. i. Pl. 60. 1.

Apollo's attribute as the Healer is one of

the oldest that was attached to him, and
is most commonly exhibited in his statues
and other representations. It is symbol·
ised by the serpent which always attends
the figures of Sdus, Aesculapius, and others
connected with the healing art. In Apol-
lo’s case this is osten taken for the serpent
Python, even when there is nothing but
mildnessin the face and attitude of the
god. Ovid (Rem. Am. ¹76) addresses him

plebi acoeptua' (B. G. i. 3).]

65. Si Palatinas videt aequus arces]
See above, v. 33 n. ‘Aras’ is the reading
os some MSS. and editions, but ‘ arces’ is
better. 1 understand ‘felix' to agree with
‘aevum‚' and ‘videt’ to govern ‘arces’
‘rem’ and ‘ Latium? It is common with
Horace to put an adjective and its substan-
tive at the two extremes of a period.
According to some ‘felix’ belongs to ‘ La-
tium,’ and also to ‘rem 3' and ‘prorogtt
felix Latium’ is equivalent to ‘proroget
felicitatem Latii? Orelli takes ‘ felix’
with ‘lustrum.’ Bentley takes it so like-
wise, but goes further, and putting ‘Si
Palatinas—Latiumque’ in a parenthesis,
makes ‘ aevnm’ the object after ‘prorogat‚
and takes all the adjectives with ‘lus-
trum,’ as though the meaning were ‘Apollo
is advancing the age into another happy,
and even a happier lustre.' He prefers
the indicative to the subjunctive. Many
good MSS. have it so, but most editors
prefer the supplicatory form, [Ritter has
‘prorogat.'] Bentley is consistent, and
reads ‘curat' and ³ applicat ’ in the next
stanza, for which he has about the same
amount of MS. authority. [Ritter has
‘curat ’ and ‘applicat,’ and 'Keller also,
though he has ‘ proroget.']

temple on Mons Aventinus and on Algidus
