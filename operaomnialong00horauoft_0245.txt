Vilis Europe, pater urget absens:
Quid mori cessas? Potes hae ab orno
Pendulum zona bene te secuta

haedere collum.

Sive te rupes et acuta leto
Saxa delectant age te procellae
Crede veloci, nisi herile mavis

Carpere pensum

edges are fatal. It is not quite clear
whether we am to suppose Agenor (Europa’s
suthe) to propone the choice of all these
sum-ddmthorto anyofthese
words or all of them. The editions are

clusion that ‘vilis Europe’ are the words of
the girl addressing herself, and her father-’s
imaginat-y invective to end with ‘quid mori
cessas? Orelli thinks that the rest cannot
‘ullo modo’ be assigned to Agenor. As a
matter of taste I prefer supposing the whole
to be the language of Europa addressing
herself, as I have taken itin the Argument.
Europa either puts the words into her
father’s mouth, or she uses them against
herself, because she thinks he will reproach
and reject her, so that it eomes to the same
thing either way.

66. Aderat querenti] See Introduction.

69. Asanam-irarum] This is a Greek
form notieed before (C. ii. 9. 17). ‘Esse
naecis' is also a Greek construction [cor-
rectly translated in the Introduction} N ot
admitting the irony in ‘invisusss which he
thinks would be ‘illepidae' ‘Venusino nostro
indigna‚' Bentley proposes to change ‘cnm
tibi invisus’ into ‘jam tibi injussus: quot-
ing virga,

“ —injussa virescunt

Gramina ” (Georg. i. 55),
and Epod. xvi. 49,—
“—injussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae‚'
which prove that Horace and Vin-gil use
this word ‘ injussus ' and that is all.

76. Nomina] The plural is thus used
in C. iv. 2. 4, and ovid (Tr. i. 1. 90):
