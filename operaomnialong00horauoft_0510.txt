HORATII FLACCI

Filius aut etiam haec libertus ut ebibat heres,
Dis inimice SeneX, custodis? Ne tibi desit?
Quantulum enim summae curtabit quisque dierum,

Ungere si caules oleo meliore caputque
Coeperis impexa foedum porrigine?

1 25
Quare,

Si quidvis satis est, perjuras, surripis, aufers

Undique? Tun sanus?

Populum si caedere saxis

Incipias servosque tuos quos aere pararis,

Insanum te omnes pueri clamentque puellae:

130

Cum laqueo uxorem interimis matremque veneno
Incolumi capite es? Quid enim, neque tu hoc facis Argis,
Nec ferro ut demens genitricem occidis Orestes.

An tu reris eum occisa insanisse parente,

Ac non ante malis dementem actum Furiis quam

135

In matris jugulo sermm tepefecit acutum?
Quin ex quo est habitus male tutae mentis Orestes,

madness. The word ‘jactari’ is applied
to the tossing of the sick and writhing of
, those in pain. Lucretius (iii. 505) :—·

“ Haec igitur tantis ubi morbis corpore iu
Ja}1t}(iiturt miserisque modis distracta
a oren .”

123. Dis inimice sene-v] This is an adap-
tation of θεοῖς ἐχθρός, a common Greek
expression. See Demos. (de Cor. p. 124):
κόλακες καὶ θεοῖς ἐχθροὶ καὶ τᾶλλα, and
p. 245, προδοτῶν καὶ δωροδόκων καὶ θεοῖς
ἐχθρῶν ἀνθρώπων.

127. perjuras] Other exampleSbf this
form are given by Forcellini, who says the
best MSS. have ‘perjuro' in Cicero, where
‘pejero’ is usually found in the editions.
As a compromise between the two forms,
Orelli's best MSS. in this place have
‘pejuras.'

129. servosque tuos quos aere pararis]
Bentley will lay any wager (‘ equidem ausim
quavis sponsione contendere’) Horace did
not write thus, but ‘servosve tuo quos aere
pararis.’ [Ritter has servosve] ‘Tuo’
appears in Ascensius' text and in a very
few of Fea’s MSS. Tan. Faber has that
word. All other MSS. and editions till
Bentley have ‘tu0s.’ Several modern
editors have adopted ‘tuo.' Heindorf has
‘tuos.' I do not sce any great difference
between the two readings. ‘Quos aere
pararis' enhances the folly of the man
who, having laid out his money in the pur-
chase of slaves, employs himself in breaking

their heads with stenes. Such a man, says
Stertinius, would be counted mad by accla-
mation. ‘ Well, then,' he adds to the
miser, ‘ are you not mad who poison your
mother or strangle your wife, to get rid of
the expense of keeping them P ⁴ of course
n0t3 for you do it, not at Ar a, but at
Rome3 not in the character of estes, but
of a respectable citizen. But do you not
believe Orestes was mad before he killed
his mother, and when no one suspected it Ρ
For ‘quid enim’ (as to which see note on
S. i. 1. 7) Bentley with bad taste substi-
tutes ‘quid ni ’θ’ What Horace alludes to
when he speaks of Orestes calling Pylades
names is uncertain. In Euripides' play of
Orestes (v. 258) he says to his sister:

μέθες’ μί’ οὖσα τῶν ἐμῶν ἓρινύων
μέσον μ’ ὀχμάζεις, ὡς βάλῃς ἐς Τάρταρον.

130. pueri clamentque puellae] “ ‘ Que'
and ‘ve' in the poets are sometimes placed,
not after the second of the two words
compared, but after a word which is the
ffmgopgledicatie of boll} egilsfeff (Kler's

. . . n a no o esser e
adds, “a cdnstructiou that probably bey-
gan with a repetition of the predicate,
‘ pueri clament clamentque puellae.'” See
below (v. 157)= “furtis pereamque rapi-
nis ;’' and many other instances.

137. male tutae mentis] Bentley shows
from Celsus that ‘tutus' was in medical
lang-uage equivalent to ‘sanus.’ ‘luco-
lumis' is used in the same sense (v. 132).
