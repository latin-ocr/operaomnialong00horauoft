EPISTULARUM Ι. 17. 631

tippus could learn to dine upon hex-bs, he would have uo mind for the company of
kings? said Diogenes. ‘ 1r my reprover knew how to keep company with king-s,
he would have no mind for herbe: said Aristippus. ‘ If 1 please mysem you plesse
the people. My line is better than yours. I pay my duty to ‚the king, and Ι ride
and foed at his expense. You beg alms, and so become lower than the lowest, though
you profess to want nothing at all! Nothing came amiss to Aristippus. He aimed
high, but was content with what he had ; but as for the Cynic, 1 should like to
know how a change of life would have suited him. The one carried himself wellin the
most crowded places, in purple or iu rags3 the other abhors fine clothes, and will
die of cold rather than wear any but his 0111 abolla. Well, give it him back, and let
the fool live. Victorias and triumphs are very fine things, no doubt3 but to win the
favour of the great is no mean merit. It is not every body who can go to (ἔοι-111111.
He who is afraid he shall not sncceed sits and does nothing. Let him pass. But hc
who does succeed, is he not a man Ρ . Nay, if it be any where, here is the very thing
we are looking for. The one shrinks from the burden because it is too much for
him, the other takes it on his shoulders and carries it through. If merit be not au
empty name, surely he does well who leaves 110 stone unturned in pursuing his
reward.

They who say nothing in the great mun's presence about their own poverty will get more
than they ask: there is a great difference between snatching and modestly receiving.
And this is the secret of success. He who eries, ‘ Ι have a poor sister, and an infirm
mother, and my estate is worth nothing, and will not support us,’ might just as well
say at once, ¹ Give me breed? Another chimes in with, ‘ Let me have a slice too in my
turn? If the blockhead could have held his tongue, he might have got more meat
and less sqnabbling for it. If a man going into the country with his great friend
complains that the roads are so rough, and the cold and wet so bitter‚ that his box
has been broken open and his money stolen. it is like the woman's trick who every
now and then eries for a stolen necklace or other ornament, so that at last no one
mm her when she loses in reality : or the man who used to pretend he had broken
his leg in order to get a ride, but when he broke his leg 111 earneet and called for help

Y ¹ no one would listen to him.
