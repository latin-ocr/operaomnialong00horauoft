HORATII FLACCI

J USTUM et tenacem propositi virum
Non civium ardor prava jubentium,
Non voltus instantis tyranni
Mente quatit solida, neque Auster
Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae, 5 ,
Nec fulminantis magna manus J ovis;
Si fractus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinae.
Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules

Enisus arces attigit igneas,

Quos inter Augustus recumbens
Purpureo bibit ore nectar.
Hac te merentem, Bacche pater, tuae
Vexere tigres indocili jugum

Martis equis Acheronta fugit,
Gratum elocuta consiliantibus
J unone divis: Ilion, Ilion
Fatalis incestusque judex

Et mulier peregrina vertit

1. Jasz‘um] i. e. “ qui jus servat.'’
5. Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae]
Compare (3. ἱὶ. 17. 19, and (3. i. 3. 152

“ Quo non arbiter Hadriae
M ajor.''

This assemblage of terrible objects is hete-
rogeneous enough, but the seventh and
eighth verses present a fine picture. The
third corresponds with J uvenal's

“ —— Phalaris licet imperet ut sis

Falsus et admoto dictet perjuria ῒαιιιοῖ

(viii. 81

6. fulminantis] This is not a word used
by prose-writers of Horace's day. The same
may be said of ‘ triumphatis’ (v. 43).

7. illabatur] The zurich and one other
of Orelli's MSS„ wit-h three of Bentley’s,
have the future, and with ‘ferient,’ that is
the more regular construction. [Keller
has ‘ inlabetur.'] But see below, C. iii.

[9. Hac arte] By the practice of justice
and firmness. Comp. Epp. ii. 1. 13.]

10. Enisa-5] Some good MSS. have
‘innisus‚’ which reading has led to ‘in-
nixus,' the reading of Acron, who ren-
ders it ‘ incumbens.' All the old editions
appear to have ‘innixus‚' and Cruqnius was
the first to adopt ¹ enisus‚’ from his Blandi-
nian MSS. and others. The idea is that of

struggling forward, and not of rest· ‘eni-
sus, ’,therefore is no doubt the best read-
ing. Ccomdpafiecffl iv. 8. 29. Epp. ii. 1. 5
sq le e e

12. Ρανρανέοέῃ bibit ore nectar] Some
MSS. have‘ bibet’ [and it is the reading
of Keller and Ritter]; but the present
has more force than the future, aa in
Epp.ii.1.15·—

“Praesentitibi maturos largimur honores?
and (C.' iv. 5. 32)—

“ -—— alteris
Te mensis adhibet deumff’

The epithet‘ purpureo’ is Greek.

--- πορφυρέου
ἀπὸ στόματος* ιεΐσα φωνὰν παρθένος

(Simonides, 7 2 Bergk).

16. Martis equis] ‘Patris equis' is a.
doubtful reading whichBentley andGesner
pi efer This appears to have been the
genuine old legend of the disappearance
of Romulus. See Ovid, Met. xiv. 820 sqq.
Fast. ii. 495 sq.. ·-—-

“Hinc tonat, hinc missis abrumpitur igni-
bus aether,
Fit fuga, rex patriis astra petebat equisf’

which gives some colour to the reading
{partrisss but not much. See Epod. xvi.
