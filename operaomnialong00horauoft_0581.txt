Q. HORATII FLACCI

EPISTOLARUM

LIBER PRIMUS.

—Q—

EPISTLE Ι.

 

Son time aster Horace had published his three books of odes, and had, as it appears.
laid uide that sort of writing, it seems that Maecenas, and probably his other friends,
hegged him to return to it. 'that is the‘ohvious meaning of the remonstrauce with
ν which the Epistle opens. He expresses an eat-nest wish to retire into privacy, to aban·
donpoouy, aud to devote himself to the study of philosophy. He disclaims all eon·

naaion with sects, and professes’ ιιι all humility, but not without some irony, to follow
, hisown oeude notions as a mere beginner, his hope and purpose, he says, is to can-y

⁷ , virtue into active practice, as that which “Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus

aeque? he recommends it ss the panacea of life, as the only true wisdom; he looks

. upon tho world as a shuffling scene of inconsistency‚ and men’s judgments as shallow

md vulgar ς he even charges his patron himself with the prevailing levity.

We may infer from all this that Horace, who knew the world pretty well, and whose
‘list had not been free from many vexations, arising out of the joalousies his popularity
and his writings had occasioned, would have been glad to retireto his books and his re-
flectionis, not, as some have said, to the study of philosophical systems, for all of which
1 believe he had a contempt in his hem-t, as he cannot help showing even in his short
summ-ry at the end of this Epistle ς the climax of his sermon on virtue is an irraeistible
joke at the expense of the Stoics‚ the most rigid though not the most practical advo-
cates of virtue. whatever views Horace had in respect to goodness and happiness were
his own: and we can believe that one who had such perceptions of the follies and vices
of the world was sincere in wishing to get away from it 3 that he was tired of a reputa-
tion which brought him into trouble 3 and that he was weary of writing verses to express

Ι ’ · a panion he never heartily felt and was still less likely to feel in his forty-fisth year. He

 

did return to Ode writing, as we know, and wrote some of his bost verses (but not his
best love verses) long aster he had pleatled his exemption with Maecenas. When this
npistls was written is not to be traced by any incidental allusions‚ and we ean only
suppose it was some time aster the publication of the odes, which was not earlier than
Amac- 730. The year 734 is assumed with some probability by Franke.
