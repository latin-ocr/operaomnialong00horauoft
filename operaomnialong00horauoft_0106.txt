GARMEN XXXII.

This ode has caused the commentators much trouble. Whether it was meant to be
an introduction to some poem Horace wrote or intended to write on one of the events
of the day, or what sort of song he was asked for and by whom, are all questions that
have been freely discussed. The question turns in the first instance on the word with
which the ode begins. The Scholiasts read ‘ Poscimur,' on which Acron’s comm-t is
‘ poscebatur dicta sua edere 3' Porphyrion’s ‘ Exigitur a nobis ut canamus? But a
large number of MSS. have ⁶ Poscimus: which Bentley adopts after Lambinus and all
the older editions. (Cruquius, however, following his Blandinian MS„ reads ‘ Posci- ’
mur.’) With that reading the ode becomes a mere invocation of the Mune, which would
suit any poem or any subject. With ‘ Poscimur‚’ which I have followed most of the
modern editors in adopting, there is still no clue whatever to the occasion of the ode,
and the Scholiasts’ remarks do not help us. I see no grounds for Dillenbr.'s supposi· ,
tion that on some important occasion Horace was asked to write a poem, and wrotethis
short ode to deprecate such a demand, and to show that his muse was not suited to such
themes. I have no doubt ¹ poscimur ’ is the true reading, and it may mean merely that

the poetic ‘ afflatus ' was on him. The abruptness of the opening favours that notion.
