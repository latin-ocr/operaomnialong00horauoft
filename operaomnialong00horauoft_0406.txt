HORATII FLACCI

Quis manus insudet volgi Hermogenisque 'h'gelliz
Nec recito cuiquam nisi amicis, idque coactus,

Non ubivis coramve quibuslibet.
Scripta foro recitent sunt multi quique lavantes:
Suave locus voci resonat conclusus.

Hoc juvat, haud illud quaerentes, num sine senSU,

Tempore num faciant alieno.

Scriptis postibus hinc et inde totis,

Omnes ut cito perlegas poetas ” (i. 118).
The price of his book he says was five
‘denarii' (about three and sixpence).
Becker (Gallus, Exc. on the Booksellers)
assumes that it was the first book, con-
taining 119 Epigrams, which he implies
would be very cheap at that price ς but as
this Epigram is one of the 119, Becker
must be mistaken. ‘ Habeat' expresses a
wish. On Hermogenes Tigellius, see S. 3.

73. Nec recito cuiquam] Some MSS„
known only to Lambinus, had‘ nec reci-
tem,’ which Bentley adopts to maintain
uniformity in the verbs ‘sim,' ‘habeat‚’
and ‘recitem.' All other known MSS.
have ‘nec recit0,’ except-ing four of Lam-
binus', which had ‘non recit0‚’ the re-
ceived reading in his day. From one Ox-
ford MS. (Magdalen) Bentley reads ‘quic-
quam' for ‘cuiquam,’ the reading of all
the other MSS. The example said to have
been set by Pollio (C. ii. 1, Introduction),
of reading his works to a circle of friends
for their criticism and amusement before
they were published, may have already
begun to be imitated by other writers.
The practice grew to be an intolerable
nuisanoe in the course of time, as we
gather, among others, from Persius (S. i.
15 sqq.), Juvenal (i. 1 sqq.; vii. 403 xiii.
32), Martial (ii. 27, &c.). Persons who
had money and dabbled in literature in-
flicted their productioris upon clients and
others whom they bribed to listen and ap·
plaud them. The author of the Dialogus
de Oratore, attributed to Tacitus (c. 9),
speaks with contempt of one Saleius Bas-
sus, a poetaster, mentioned by Juvenal
(vii. 80), who went about praying people
to listen to his recitations, and hired and
prepared a room for the purpose. But if
Pollio was the originator of this practice,
as he is said to have been, it could hardly
yet have grown 'into the sy stem it after—

“ Laedere gaudes,”

and annoying neighbours while they gra-
tified themselves. Ι do not think Orelli
is right in associating this passage with
the recitatious above referred to, or in
saying “qui vel in medio foro, id est
dempta hyperbola coram maxima audito-
rum corona carmina recitaret.'’ 1 think
Horace means literally in the forum.
Orelli supposes a knot of friends assembled
on the ‘schola’ round the ‘labrum’ for
the purpose of listening to the sels-satis-
fied reciter. The ‘scholae' were spaces for
people to sit or walk on round the baths
generally, not merely round the ‘labrum‚’
which was a bath of small dimensione
attached to the principal hot-baths (see
Becker's Gallus, Exc. ‘on the Baths ').
On these ‘scholae’ people walked about,
and couceited authors could tea-se their
acquaintance and the strangers that were
comp elled to listen to them, and in the act
of bathing they could do the same. Seneca
OEP‘. 56) speaks of the annoyance of one

‘cui vox sua in balneo p.'la<·et'

77. haud illud quaerentes] ‘’Illud is
thus used commonly to introduce some-
thing about to be mentioned in opposition
to what has been just mentioned. See
Key's L. G. 1106.

78. Laedere gaudee, inquit] Horaoe
has said that even if he does write or recito
it is only in a private mv, and no one
thereforey need be afraid of him. He now
disposes of the charge of writing· with ma-
licious intent. The editions till Bentley’ s
have ‘inquis-² Two MSS. of Torrentius’,
which he calls ‘ vetustissimi codices‚' had
‘inquit‚' and that is the usual formula,
even when the second person has preceded
or foUows, as Bentley has shown by several
examples. ‘Studio'y is used adverbially‚

‘of set purpose in your malignityy ou do q

it.’ [Ritter has‘ inquis' conformably to
the most· numerous and best MSS„ as he

in public places (the forum and the baths)
to chance acquaintances, or even sti-angere,
