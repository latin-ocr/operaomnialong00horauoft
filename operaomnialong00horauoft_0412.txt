376 HORATII FLACCI

If the occasion above suppoaed be that on which the mission was sent, they could
not have met Antonius at Brundusium, and their journey could not have ended there:
Maecenas at least, and his official companions, must have gone on to Tarentum. Whe-
ther Horace accompanied them is uncertain. I think probably he did not3 but that
Maecenas, hearing that Antonius had come to Brundusium, and passed ‚on to Tarentum,
made all haste to reach that place. I think it likely, however, that Horace took the
opportunity of his return to Rome to visit his native town and the neighbourhood.
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 39 sq.) thinks that it was on this occasion he wrote the ode to
Archytas (C. i. 28), and that to the fountain ofBandusia (C. iii. 13) 3 that he visited Septi-
mius (C. ii. 6), and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella (S. ii. 2). Probably Horace took
more than one journey to Tarentum, with which when he wrote his ode to Septimius
he appears to have had very pleasant associations: He seems to have had in mind, as
the Scholiasts say, the description by Lucilius of a joumey to Capua, of which three or
four verses only have been preserved (see note on v. 6).

EGRESSUM magna me excepit Aricia Roma
Hospitio modico; rhetor comes Heliodorus,
Graecorum longe doctissimus ; inde Forum Appi,
Differtum nautis cauponibus atque malignis.

1. Egressum mayname excepit Aricia] vellers of any importance usually found
They lest Rome by the Porta Capena, be· friends at the principal towns who enter·

. in the southern quai-ter of the cit

tween Mons Aventinus and Mons Caelius

. ‘Acce-
pit,' ‘cepit,’ are various readings,y0f which,
after Lambinus and Cruquius, Bentley has
adopted the first. [Ritter has ‘accepit‚’
and he refers to S. ii. 6. 81.] Aricia (La
Riccia), one of the most ancient towns of
Latium, was sixteen miles from Rome. It
was situated on the side of a hill sloping
down to a valley called Vallis Aricina,
through which the Appia Via passed. This
part of the road is still in good preserva-
tion. The citadel was placed on the top of
the hill (Strabo, v. p. 239), and on that
spot stands the modern town. Aricia was
a considerable town in Horace’s time, and
for some centurias after. Cicero calls it

“municipium—vetustate antiquissimum,
splendore municipum honestissimum’'
(Phil. iii. 6).1Τ110 neighbourhood to Rome,
and the accessible position, contributed to
the prosperity of the place, which was as-
sisted by its association with the worship
of Diana Aricina, who had a temple among
the woods on the small lake (Lacus Nemo-
rensis), a short way from the town, proba-
bly on the site of the modern town Nemi.
The wealthy Romans had villas in the
neighbourhood.

By ‘hospitio modico’ Horace means an
indifferent ιιιιις but‘ hospitium’ is not the
Latin for an‘ iun, 'which was called‘ cau-
pona? or ‘taberna‚’ or ‘diversorium,’ and
the keeper‘ caupo? The· mns at the diffe-
rent stages on the great roads were neve'r
very good, the chief reason being that tra-

taincd them.
2. rhetor comet Heliodorus] Horace

jocularly exaggerates the mei-its of the

rhetorician. The reading ‘linguae’ for
‘ longe‚’ adopted by Gesner among others,
makes nonsense. Heliodorus was aGreek,
and might well know his own language‚ as
Lambinus observes. [Ritter reminds us
that Heliodorus is the Telephus of C. iii.
19.] ‘ Appii Forum' was forty-three miles
from Rome, and was so called by Appius
Claudius, sumamed Caecus, who in his
censorship (A.U.c. 442) constructed the
Via Appia as far as Capua, and the great
aqueduct which bore his name. Some
ruins of this town are said to existf ‘Differ-
tum nautis.- plenum, sc. his qui in Pomp-
tinis paludibus nav’ ant. atque mali-
m‘s: deest hominibus’' (Acron). The
participle ‘differtus' is formed as from
‘diffi’rcioss which verbis not found. ‘ Dif-
fertus' occurs below (Epp. i. 6. 59)=
“Differtum transire fomm.'’ Fea follows
the Scholiast in taking ‘malign is’ abso-
lutely. It no doubt belongs to ⁶ cauponi-
bus’ in the same sense as ‘perfidus hie
caupo' (S. i. 29). It was to Appii Forum
that some of the Christiana, when they
heard of St. Paul’s approach, went from
Rome to meet him. Others met him at a
place called Tres Tabernae, which was be-
tween Aricia and Appii Forum. Horace
must have passed through this town with·
out stopping. It was a well-known place,
and from it a Christian bishop took his
title, ‘⁸ Felix a Tribus Tabernis.'’
