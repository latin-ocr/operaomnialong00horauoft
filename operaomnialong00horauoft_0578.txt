The prawns were swimming in sance, the
composition of which the host goes on to
describe himself. as a matter of too much
consequence to be left to the explanation
of his nomenclator. The materials were
Venafran olive oil (Ο. ii. 6. 16 11.), ‘garum'
(a sance made of the entrails and blood of
fish, and here made from the scomber,
perhaps the mackerel, caught in greatest
abundance off the coast of Spain. See Pliny
(xxxi. 8), “ Garum ex scombro pisce lauda-
tissimum in Carthaginis Spartariae ceta-
riis ;’' and Martial (xiii. 102) 2—-

some Italian wine added while it was mak-
ing, and some Chian when it was made 3
white pepper (S. 4. 74 n.) aud vinegar made
from Lesbian wine (C. i. 17. 21). Of the
other ingredients Nasidienus boasts ofhav-
ing invented two himself 3 one was the
‘eruca‚' which we call the rocket‚ a vege-
table of the genus brassica, and the ‘inula
campana‚' ‘ elccampane‚’ the ‘inula hele-
nium' (ἑλένιον) of Linuaeus‚ a plant that
grows in meadows and damp ground. It
is used medicinally as a bitter. The last
ingredient was the ‘ echinus,’ a prickly
shell-fish, thrown in without being washed,
for the benefit of its saline qualities: for
which addition to the sauce he gives credit
to one Curtillus. The superiority of the
‘ echinus ’ to ‘ muria ' (S. ii. 4. 65 n.) is here

said to consist in the fact of the former
coming fresh from the sea, and furnishing
a more perfect brine.

[43. Sub hoe] ‘Upon this: when the
lamprey appeared. See Epod. ii. 44 n.

[50. The line ‘ Quod Methymnaeam’ .
is an example of careless writing. Horace
simply means viuegar made by allowing
wine of Methymna to become acid.]

54. aulaea] See C. iii. 29. 15 11. The
host's tiresome dissertation was brought
to a sudden close by the falling of the tapes-
try, which brought down among the dishes
an immense cloud of aust. The guests
fancy the house is coming down, but when
they find the extent of the damage thoy
recover themselves (‘ erigimur '). Rufus
(Nasidienus) was so disturbed by this un-
toward accident that he ut down his head
and began to shed tears. omentsnus com-
forts him with an apostrophe to For-tune,
complaining of her caprices, the solemn
hypocrisy of which makes Fundanius laugh
so immoderately that he is obliged to stuff
his napkin into his mouth to check himself.
Balatro, who has a sneer always ready
(μυκτηρίζων, see S. i. 6. 5), begins a long
sympathetic and flattering speech, with
which Nasidienus is highly pleased and
comforted under his misfortune. A bril-
liant thought suddenly strikes him, and 1111
calls for his shoes and out, on which
the guests begin to titter and to whisper to
one another, not wishing to give offence, or
to speak out before the parasites and the
slaves. (54-78.)
