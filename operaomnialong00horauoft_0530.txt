HORATII FLACCI

The Greeks called it τελλίνη or ξιφύδριον.
The ‘lapathus’ is mentioued as a purgative
(Epod ii. 57 11.) ‘Brevis‚’ which Por-
phyrion interprets ‘ short-lived? as “breve
lilium '’ (C. i. 36. 16), refers rather, as
Orelli says, to the size of the plant.
[Celsus (ii. 29, ‘De his quae alvum movent’)
mentions in a long list of purgatives the
‘lapathum,' many kinds of shell-fish, and
wine, ‘ dulce vel salsum.5 Athenaeus (i.
32. Cas), quoted by Ritter‚ states that
wines carefully mixed with sea-water are
purgative ς and hence, Ritter says, Persius
(v. 135) names wines of Cos, ‘lubrica Coa?
because they are purgative ; and the wine
of Cos was moderately mixed with sea-
water.

anus the poet, at his country seat, there
arrived a large supply of oysters from
Rome, which proved to be poor shrivelled
things, and the host accounted for it by
the fact that the moon was then on the
wane‚ quoting Lucilius:

“ Luna alit ostrea et implet echinos, muri-
bu’ fibras
Et pecui addit?

The same he affirms in respect to cats’ eyae,
that they get larger as the moon increases,
and smaller as she wanes. The ancients
had many fancies respecting the influence
of the moon on various objecta in which
however modern ignorance and superstition
have perhaps surpassed them. But in re-
spect to shell-fish, Heury Swinburne, whose
amusing account of his travels in the Two
Sicilies in the years 177 7-1780 Ι have
often quoted, says: “ It is an observatiou
made here (at Taranto), and confirmed by
longexperieuce, that all the testaceous tribe
are fuller, fatter, and more delicate during
the new and full moon than in the first and
last quarters’' (vol. i. p. 244). So that
modern observation is in conformity with
that of the ancients. Swinburne accounts

for the fact “by the tides and currents
which set in stronger in the new and full
moon, and bring with them large quan·
tities of bruised fishes, insecta, fruita, and
other fattening nurture.” [Ι. Vossius (note
ou Gellius, xx. 8. ed. Gronovius) says thatin
certain parts of Asia ‘in novilunio et
plenilunio inania sunt pleraque testacea,
eadem vero plena sint in quadraturis? He
explains this by the fact that in these
parts there is no tide at new and full
moon, but four or five days laten]

32. Murice Baiano] This shell—fish, from
which a purple dyc was obtained, was
found at Baiae. lt is thus described by
Swinburne: “The body consists of three
parts3 the lowest, containing the bowels,re-
mains fixed in the twisted screw at the
bottom for the purpose of persor-ming ‚tho
digestive functions; it is fleshy and tinged
with the colour of its food. The middle di-
vision is of a callous substance and full of
liquor, which, if let out of its bag, will
stain the whole animal and its habitation.
The third and upper part is made up of
the members necessary for procuring food
and perpetuating the. racc. Τ116 murex
generally remains fastened to rocks aud
stones. Τ118 proper season for dragging for
this shell-fish was in autumn and winter.
To come at the liquor the sheu was broken
with one smart blow‚ and the pouch ex-
tracted with the greatest nicety by means
of a hook. If the shells were of a small
size they were thrown by heaps into a mill
and pounded'’ (i. 239). The ‘peloris,'
which was found in the Lacus Lucrinus,
close to Baiae, appears from Martial to
have been an insipid fish, though Catius
says it is better than the murex. “Tu
Lucrina voras, me pascit aquosa peloris”
(vi. 11). “ Et fatuam summa coenare pelo-
rida mensa” (x. 37). The rival oyster-
beds were in the Lacus Lucrinus and at
Circeii. Catius gives the preference to the
oysters of Circeii, which Pliny also says
§.⁹23 ¹35¹⁵¹¹÷ffi⁸ziit<333331132>w533„‚³32‡
found at Brundusium, from whence the
spawn was carried to stock the beds on the
coast of Campania aud Latium.
