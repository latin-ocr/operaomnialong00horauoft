566 HORATII FLACCI

from this but the other Epistle, in which he makes his excuses to him for not having
sent him any poetry.

Florus was evidently a young man at this time, and all the persons named were
young. One of them (Celsus) was secretary to Tiberius. Whether the others had any
definite occupation, or were merely travelling to enlarge their experience and see the
world, is not stated. Horace assumes that they are not wasting their time, but. pur-
suing their studies and practising their pens. He inquires after his young friends in a
way that shows his interest in them, offers them such advice and encouragement as he
thinks they need, and especially begs Florus to be reconciled to Munatius, with whom

he had for some reason quarrelled. This was probably Horace's chief design in writing

this Epistle.

3. Thracane vos Hebrusque] The first
of these is the Latin form of the Greek
Θρῄκη. It has been observed before that
Horace generally uses the Latin termina-
tions in the Satires and Epistles, and the
Greek in th'e Odes. The Hebrus he else—
where calls “hiemi sodalem ” (C. i. 25.

ὲ. vicinas· inter currentia turres] ΤῘΙΘ
Scholiast Porphyrion says these were the
towers or castles of Hero and Leander, at
Sestos and Abydos. The former stood on
the European shore of the Hellespont, and
the modern name is Akbachi. The strait
takes a bend to the north-east between
the two towns, and Abydos stood directly
south of Sestos, at the distance of thirty
stadia. There is a village named Avido,
which is supposed to stand on the site of
Abydos, though others identify the site of
the village of Nagara with that of Abydos
(see Creuzer's note on Herod. v. 117). The
story of Leander swimming by night re-
peatedly, till he lost his life in a storm,
from Abydos to visit Hero the priestess of
Venus at Sestos is well known from Ovid's
two Epistles (Heroid. 18, 19) and Virgil
(Georg. iii. 258 sqq.). Lord Byron and
a companion in the year 1810, in the
mouth of May, swam from the European
shore to the Asiatic, “entering a consi-
derable way above the European, and
landing below the Asiatic fort.'' “The
rapidity of the current is such that no
boat can row directly across.” They swam
the distance, onein an honr and five
minutes, and the other in an hour and ten
minutos, and calculated that they had

Hoc quoque curo.

swum upwards of four English miles,
“though the actual breadth is barely one.''
“ The water was extremely cold, from the
melting of the mountain snows.” Accord-
ing to this account, which I have given
in Lord Byron's words, there are still two
forts on the opposite shores 'of the Hel-
lespont in the narrowest part, which is
only seven stadia wide (Herod. vii. 34).
But the European fort cannot occupy the
site of Sestos which was higher up. It
is probably on the spot to which Xerxes’
bridge was thrown over from Abydos,
which Herodotus calls ἀκτὴ τραχέα ἐς
θάλασσαν κατήκουσα, lying between Sestos
and Madytus (Maito). It is not impro-
bable that there was a fortified town there,
or a castle in former times, and that
Horace alludes to it in this place. The
strength of the current above described is
referred to in ‘currentia’ For ‘turres’
the oldest Blandinian Ms. had ‘terras,’
which Bentley, “semper novitatis avidus,”
adopted, saying, that though we hear in
different poets of the tower of Hero at
Sestos, we hear nothing of a tower at
Abydos, the plain reason of course being
that it was necessary to the story that the
priestess should have a tower or some high
place from which to show the signal-light
to her lover. Abydus was a fortified place,
and stood more than one siege, and ‘turris’
does not necessarily mean a tower. It
may mean a fortified place or a castle.

6. Quid studiosa cohors operwm] As
to ‘cohors,' see S. i. 7. 23 n. ‘Operum’
belongs to ‘quid‚' aud signifies here
‘ writings‚' either prose or poetry.
