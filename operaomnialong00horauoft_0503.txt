Nam male re gesta cum vellem mittere operto
Me eapite in flumen, dexter stetit et, Cave faxis
Te quidquam indignum; pudor, inquit, te malus angit,

Insanos qui inter vereare insanus haberi.

Primum nam inquiram quid sit furere: hoe si erit in te
Solo nil verbi pereas quin fortiter addam.

Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri
Caecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex

Autumat.
Excepto sapiente tenet.

Desipiant omnes aeque ac tu qui tibi nomen

Insano posuere.

Palantes error certo de tramite pellit,

44. Oioyeippi porticus] This was the
στοὰ ποικίλη at Athens, in which Zeno
ant taught, aud from which his followers
dafived their name (Diogenes Laertius,
vii. Zeno). The Stoics seem to have ad-
mitted no mean between perfect wisdom
or virtue and absolute folly or vice. The
fool therefore was a madman, and he was

a fool who was ignorant of the truth; and
this applies to all mankind, high and low,
except the sage; the sage therefore is he
who is perfectly acquainted with the truth,
which is the Stoics’ equivalent for a vir-
tuous man. This theory of virtue led to
the doctrine of punishments ridiculed by
Horace ἰιι the third Satire of the first
book. The Stoies allowed no gradations
of virtue, and therefore admitted ιιο gra-
dations of punishment. Their notion of a

sage altogether was irrational, because uo “

such being as they imagined a sage to be
ever existed. Perhaps it was intended to
put before the world the highest standard
of virtue, wisdom, and sels-control, and
by withholding all credit from any stage
short of pei-fection to lead men ou to
desire pei-fection: a very diseouraging
method it must be admitted.

45. [formula] This is a legal term, a
set form of words, which may contain a
definition or a rule of law, or form of
action, as Gaius iii. 222: ‘Veluti si quis
alienum servum verberaverit, et in hunc
casum formula proponitur! See Cicero,
de Off. iii. 14.]

47. qui tibi nomen insano] Lambinus
reads ‘ insani‚' but the dative is right. See
above, v. 25 ιι.

48. [passim] ‘ As their steps may lead,
‘in all directions: ‘huc et illuc! Comp.
Ovid, Met. i. 57.]
