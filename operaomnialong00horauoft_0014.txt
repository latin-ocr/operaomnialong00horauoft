x PREFACE.

been eareful as far as possible to let Horace illustrate himself,
without however distraeting the reader by referring him back-
wards and forwards to passages that will throw no light upon the
text.

The MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or headings to the different poems. That these were not given
them by Horace himself is clear, but they appear in the earliest
MSS„ and are supposed by some to have been invented by the
grammarians almost contemporary with the author. They vary
very much in the different MSS„ and as they are quite arbitrary

they have their value as showing the opinion of very early gram-
marians as to the scope of the different poems, and I have accord-

disputed points.

I had supposed before I began that much that now appears in
the notes might be omitted by merely referring the reader to the
Dietionaries of Antiquities and Biography edited by Dr. Smith.
But valuable as those works are, I found that the articles were not
and could not be so drawn up as to save the necessity, in many
instanees, of independent notes in such a eommentary and for
such an author as this. Ι have often referred to them, and if
I ought to have done so oftener the omission has been unin-

I meant at first to give an Index of the prineipal words, to form
a Coneordanee at the end of the Volume ς but I found there was no
room for it, and I hope that, as I have made the Index to 1116
notes pretty eopious‚ and have given a full Index of Proper Names
expressed or referred to in 1116 text, the want of the other Index
will not be much felt.

I had hoped it would be possible to give engravings of a few
