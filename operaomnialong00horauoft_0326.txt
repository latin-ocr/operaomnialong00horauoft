OARMEN VI.

The Scholiast Porphyrion says of this ode that it is directed against some man who
was given to attacking virulently unoffending persons. Acron says his name was Cassius,
and that he was a slanderous poet. Compound‘mg these statements, and amplifying them
from his own head and the language of the ode, Cruquius' Scholiast makes Cassius to
be Cassius Severus, an orator of great celebrity and bitterness, who was banished by
Augustus, and after remaining in exile for twenty-five years dieda beggarsm. 33, more
than sixty-three years aster the composition of this ode. The Scholiast’s authority is
destroyed by his own description of Severus, who, he says, was very abusive and attacked
the best of men, but was easily appeased by filling his belly and plying him with money,
for which reason Horace compares him to a dog, duc. This is the language of a mere
compiler, and is worthy of no credit. The silence of Porphyrion, and the positive state·
ment of Acron that the Cassius of this ode was a poet (which we have 110 authority for
supposing Severus was), as well as the extreme youth of Severus at the time it was
written, are all opposed to the notion that he is the person attacked ; and moreover so
far from being the coward Horace describes, Severus boldly attacked meu of influenee,
and suffered for doing so ς and as to his murice, it was through persisting in the course
his nature inclined him to, of indiscriminate abuse, that he came to destitution aud died
in that condition. Although therefore Comm. Cmq. has been followedby all the editors
