Putet aper rhombusque recens, mala copia quando
Aegrum sollicitat stomachum, cum rapula plenus

Atque acidas mavolt inulas.

Pauperies epulis regum3 nam vilibus ovis

Nigrisque est oleis hodie locus. Haud ita pridem

Infamis.

Quid, tunc rhombos minus aequora alebant?

Tavus erat rhombus tutoque ciconia nido

Donec vos auctor docuit praetorius·

Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos,
Parebit pravi docilis Romana. juventus.
Sordidus a tenui victu distabit, Ofella

Judice; nam frustra. vitium vitaveris illud,

Si te alio pravum detorseris.

42. rhombus] This fish, if it was the
inl-bot, was not less esteemed by the Ro-
mans than by ourselves. The {inest were
caught in the Adriatic, whence the fish
that caused such a sensation in J uvenal’s
story (S. iv. 3¹7 sqq.) he calls “ Hadriaci
spatium admirabile rhombi.” Respecting
‘rapula’ and ‘ inulae‚’ see below, S. 8. 51.
On thecuae of eggs at the ¹ promulsis: see
S. i. 3.6. The sense in which Horace uses
the words ‘pauper' and ‘rex’ is well
marked here (see C. i. 1. 18, and C. i. 4.

¹ 14). [‘ Nigris oleis ε’ some olives were
prepared for keeping, “cum jam nigrue-
rint nec adhuc tamen permaturae fuerint ;’'
Columella, xii. 49. 1.]

4⁷. Galloni praeconis erat acipensere]
‘⁶ Hie est qui primus acipenserem convi-
viis apposuit” (Porph.). This was iu the
time of Lucilius and of Laelius. A few
verses of the former have been preserved
by Cicero (de Finn. ii. 8), in which he re·
have seen (S. ii. L 72 n.)‚ of the simplest

“ kind :—

“ O lapathe ut jactare necesse est cognitu’
begoni-aeli& clamores σοφὸς ille solebat
Edere compellans gumias ex ordine nos-
’(ξιῗώἶὶ, Ο gurges Galloni, es homo
miser‚’ inquit.

‘Coenasti in vita nunqnam bene quum
omnia in ista

‘Consumis squilla 'atque acipensere eum
decumano? ''

‘ Acipenser' is said to be a stru-geon. The
fish was out of fashion in Pliny’s days (N.
H. ix. c. 27).1n respect to ‘praeconia' -
see S. i. 6. 86 n. [⁵ Aequor alebat?
Ritter.]

50. auctor docuit praetorius] On this
Porphyrion tells us that one Rufus was the
first to bring into fashion the eating of
ffiffiosst‘t'ss’gssrsssssgssssssngffi{waitzii}
contradiction, since aster Horace he calls
him ‘praetorius‚’ but that does not much
matter, the story is equally good), being
rejected, the following epigram was made
upon him :—

“ Ciconiarum Rufus iste eonditor

Hic est duobus elegantior Plancis ε

Suffiragiorum puncta non tulit septem.

Ciconiarum populus ultus est mortem.”

When Rufus lived it is impossible to say;
or whether he was the first to introduce
the ‘rhombus’ as well as the ‘ciconia.’
The stork went out of fashion, as Ofella.
predicts ; and though gulls did not take
its place, cranes came into vogue, as Estr6
has pointed out from Pliny (N. H. x. 23,
§30). See S. ii. 8. 87. As to ‘auem-5
see C. i. 28. 14, n. The word ‘edixerit’
is a play upon the ‘edictum ' of the ‘prae-
tor.’ [‘ pravi docilis': ‘docilis modorum,’
C. iv. 6. 43].

55. pravum detorseris] Literally, ‘turn

yourself awry.’ Bentley, on the authority
of one MS„ reads ‘pi-avus?

56. dictum] The MSS. are divided be-
tween ‘ ductum ² and ‘dictum.' In this,
as in the last case, either would do.
