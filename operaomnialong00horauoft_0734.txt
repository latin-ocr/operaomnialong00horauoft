698 HORATII FLACCI

third Epistle belonging to the second book. But it was looked upon as a separate
treatise at least as early as Quintilian, who quotes the first verse as that which Horace
wrote “in prima parte libri de Arte Poetica” (viii. 3. 60). Τ110 00115 grammar-iaus all
treat it in the same way and call it by the same name.

ARGUMENT.

Ridiculous 05 a monstrous picture, combining the head of a woman with a body made
up of beast, fowl, 01111 fish, is that poem of which the images are thrown together like
a sick man's dream, whose beginning and end have no connexion.

But poets aud painters may take what liberties they please. ’

Granted, within bounds ς 11111 not that they should breed monsters, or patch up their
verses with tawdry images, out of place, like the painter who stuck a cypress in
his picture of a wreck. In short, whatever it is, let it be simple and uniform.

(v. 24.) We poets 010 0111 10 110 misled 115 501110 standard of our own. A man tries 10
110 511011 01111 becomes obscure; to be smooth and becomes vapid3 to be sublime and
becomes turgid ; to be humble and becomes creeping, to be varied and produces
monsters. So in avoiding one error skill is needed lest we fall into the opposite.

(v. 32.) Neither would 1 be as that artist who could finish better than any one the
small details of a statue, but could not compose a whole. Choose your subject
according to your strength. So shall 5011 find words and method, the merit of which
is that it says every thing at the right time, 81111 01100505 115 topics with judgment.

(v. 46.) In the choice and introduction of words also care is required, so that 0111 words
may get new force from their connexion. You may use new words if necessary,

Α provided you do not exceed, especially if they be taken from the Greek. Why should
not we do it as well as the poets of old ‘r' Words drop in time like the leaves of the
forest: all things must perish; the greatest works of skill must decay, how much
more must language Ρ But old words will rise up again if fashion wills, for she is
the mistress of 51100011. “

(v. 73.) 111 the relation of martial deeds Homer led the way. Then elegy 081110 with
lamentation and with love, the author of which our critics have not determined.
Archilocus was driven by 1080 to 1011111105, which the stage adopted. To the lyre they
sang of gods and heroes, of fighters and horses, of love and wine. ¹

(v. 86.) Now if 1 cannot maintain the distinctions of style, how can Ι 110 called a poet?
Why should Ι not rather 100111 Ρ Comedy is not to be expressed in tragic style, nor
tragedy in comio, though comedy may sometimes raise her tone and tragedy lower
hers. A poem must be not only fair to look at, but sweet and affeeting, and must
strike the chord of sympathy. And the language must be suited to the character.
For there 15 that in our nature which adapts itself to every variety of circumstance,
according as the tongue sets it before us. But if the language and character do not
agree. it only creates a laugh. r

(v. 119.) Then again you must either follow tradition or let your fictions be consistent.
Achilles must be the impetuous stern warrior, Medea the savage mother, and so on.
Or if you venture on bringing forward a. new character it must be consistent
throughout.

(v. 128.) It is not easy to handle subjects which all may handle. One may more easily
dramatize the fall of Troy than write a new story entirely. But a man may make
common property his own if he does not confine himself to ordinary common—places,
or follow his author too literally and tie himself down too much. And 5011 must not
begin ostentatiously‚ or the issue will be only ridiculous, like that of the mountain in
labour. How simple is Homer's beginning, ‘⁴ Tell of the man, Ο Muse,'’ &aa There
is no smoke here coming after the fiash, but the light grows upon us as we proceed
in the shape of beautiful and marvellous tales : he carries us on rapidly to the end,
