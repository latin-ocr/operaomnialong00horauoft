Contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens
Sperare fortunaque dulci
Ebria. Sed minuit furorem
Vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico
Redegit in veros timores
Caesar, ab Italia volantem
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus
Venator in campis nivalis
Haemoniae, daret ut catenis
Fatale monstrum : quae generosius
Perire quaerens nec muliebriter
Expavit ensem nee latentes
Classe cita reparavit orae.

under ground, in which the ‘dolia' were
kept. That in which the ‘amphorae’ were
stol-ed was called ‘apothecass and was in
the upper part of the house: hence the
ten-ms, ‘ depromere‚’ ‘ deripere‚' ‘ descen-
dere? ‘ Capitolio ’is equivalent to ‘urbi.'
Seec. iii. 8. 423 iii. 30. 8.

7. Beyina dementes ruinas] A similar
enallage is in Aen. ii. 576: “Ulcisci pa-
triam et sceleratas sumere poenas‚” where
‘sceleratas' expresses the guilt of Helen.

9. Contaminata camyreye turpium Mor-
bo virorum] ‘With her filthy herd of men
(forsooth) foul with disease.' The corrupt
lusia of that class of ns who were most
about an Eastern queen are properly called
a disease. ‘Virorum,’ to which Bentley
objecta, is used ironically as it would seem.
He promes ‘opprobriorum ’ for ‘ morbo
virorum,’ to co nd to Homer's κάκ’
ἐλέγχεα ; but, as he obJ'ects to nothing but

⁷ ‘vitonum’ his alteration would not be

wanted even if it were better than it is.
In Epod. ix. 11 Horace complains :—

“ Romanus—eheu! posteri negabitis—-
Emancipatus feminae
Fert vallum et arma miles, et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest.”
10. impotens Sperare] This is a com·
mon construction, noticed at C. i. 1. 18.

’χ ‘Impotens’ corresponds to ἀκρατής, and
⁸ - signifies want of sels—controh ‘wild enough

to expect any thing? See Forcell.
12. Ebria] Demosthenes (Phil. i. 54. 9,
Beiske) appliesthe same metaphor to Philip z

⁸ ἆγὸ δ’ οἴομαι μὲν, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, νὴ

τοὺς θεοὺς ἐκεῖνον μεθύειν τῷ μεγέθει τᾶν
rega-rign& sospes navis] Cleopatra’s
fleet escaped from the battle of Actium, but
Μ. Antonius saved no more than his own
ship in which he ssed to Egypt. No allu-
sion is made to Μ. Antonius, for the same
reason that led Augustus to require the
Senate to proclaim war only against Cleo-
patra, though M. Antonius was the chief
object of it.

14. Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico]
‘ Lymphatus’ is equivalent to νυμφόληπτος,
‘lympha’ and ‘nympha’ being the same
word (see Forcell.). Mareotic wine was
from the shores of the Lake Mareotis in
the neighbourhood of Alexandria. ‘ In
veros timores' is o to what the
Greeks called τὰ κενὰ τοῦ πολέμου. Cleo-
patra’s fleet fled from Actium before a
blow was struck, under the influenee of a
panic, but Horace choosae to say it was a
‘verus timor? Though it is said that
Cleopatra meditated a descent upon Italy,
in the event of Μ. Antonius and herself
proving successful at Actium, she fied from
that place to Egypt and never went near
Italy, whither Augustus returned aster the
battle; audit was not till the next year,
mu c. 724, that he went to Alexandria,
and the deaths of M. Antonius and Cleo-
patra occurred. '

[21. Fatale] That which is fixed by
fate, whether for a good or a bad purpose.
Comp. Epp. ii. 1. ll, ‘Notaque fatali por--
tenta labore subegit.']
