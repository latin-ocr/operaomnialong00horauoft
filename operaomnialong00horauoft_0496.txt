460 HORATII FLACCI

out for some one less knowing or less bold, and part with them if necessary at a
sacrifice. There can be little doubt that the Damasippus here mentioned is the person
Horace introduces in this Satire. Doering and other commentators, following Com.
Cruq. (who says “consumpto per mercatum patrimonio ''), call him a ‘ mercator: which
it is plain he was not. That he was not a regular traderis clear from the people calling
him ‘Mercurialem' (v. 25). The ‘ mercatores ² were always under the protection of
Mercury (“ Mercuriales viri '’)‚ and there would be nothing particular in the applica-
tion of the word to Damasippus if he had not been merely a private person, who had
turned his hand to trading. Why Horace should have chosen this man as the mouth-
piece of his Satire does not appear. He says himself, it is true, that having ruined his
own affairs he had nothing to do but to attend to the affairs of others ς which Horace
interprets to mean, that he had taken to giving advice when it was not asked (see
v. 27 n.). But Horace may have had better reasons for employing this man’s name,
which we have no means of knowing. He may have ruined himself and taken to cant,
as Horace here represents; but we know nothing farther about him.

Stertinius appears to have been an authority among the Stoics of the day. The
Scholiasts tell us he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school. Damasippus
calls him (v. 286ss ‘sapientum octavus. '³ His books, if he ever wrote them, have not
rescued him from oblivion. Horace mentions him again in Epp.‘ 1. 12. 20 as the repre-
sentative of the sect. Estre suggests that he may have been the Stertinius mentioned
by Quintilian (iii. 1, 21) as the author of a treatise on oratory, though, as he says, the
Stoics troubled themselves less with rhetoric than with dialectic.

The discourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every man in the world, high
or low, is mad except the sa-ge (see note on v. 46). Cicero has argued the same doctrine
of the Stoics in his Paradoxa (iv. ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται), but he does not go very
deep into the subject, or throw much light upon it.

ARGUMENT.

You write so seldom, and destroy what you have written, and are angry with yourself
because you are too lazy to write any thing worth speaking of. What do you mean

to do P You aeknowledge you came to this retreat to escape the noise of the Satur· ¹

nalia. Well, then, begin: let us have something suited to your intentioris. It’s of
no use to find fault with your pens and beat the wall. Where are all your promises i’
What have you brought out all your books for? Do you mean to avoid odium by
shirking your duty? Men will only despise you for your pains. 'Tis nothing but
sloth. Flee from the Siren, orbe content to forfeit all you have earned in better days.

(v. 16.) Heaven reward you, Damasippus, with a barber for your good advice. But
how came you to know me so well Ρ

Since the usurers robbed me of all my money, I have taken to managing other people’s
affairs. 1 used to be such a successful driver of bargains in all sorts of property,
that people called me every where the ward of Mercury.

1 am aware of that. How did you get rid of that mania P You seem, however, only
to have exchanged it for another, as a pain in the head is transferred to the stomaeh,
or as the patient in a stupor suddenly falls to fighting his doctor. Only don’t follow
his example, and you may have it all your own way.

(v. 31.) My good friend, you need not deceive yourself. You, and all fools 1 may say,
are mad, if there be any truth in Stertinius, who saw me one day as 1 was ready to
throw myself into the river; and “ for shame,'' said he ε “ why should you mind
being called mad when all are so Ρ For what is madness Ρ Folly and blind ignorance
of the truth. An are mad from the highest to the lowest, except the wisc. As in a
wide wood where all lose their way, though all go in different directions, so is it with
fools. One is afraid where there is no sear, another‘ wantonly rushes into danger,
