{hows that Rupilius belonged to the ‘ co-
ors?

27. fertur quo rara securis] Between
precipimus banks covered with trees where
the axe seldom comes from their inaccessi-
ble position.

28. multoque fluenti] The editors till
Bentley had ‘multum 3' and all, with the
exception of Dacier, including the Scho-
liasts, referred the words to ‘ arbusto‚' with
what meaning it is hard to imagine, even
with their notes before 113. Torrentius first
‘brought the reading ‘ multo ' to light from

· some good MSS.. and it has since appeared
in many. Bentley quotes aptly Dem. de
Coron. (p. 272), τῷ Πύθωνι θρασυνομένῳ καὶ
πολλῷ ῥέοντι καθ’ ὑμῶν οὐχ ὑπεχώρησα.

29. Expressa arbusto] The illustration
Horace chooses for the abuse which the
enraged Rupilius hurls back (‘ regerit ’)

and full] is that which the vine-dresser
retorts upon the traveller, who provokes
him in the first instance by calling to him
‘ cuckoo,’ but who is fain to retreat before
the storm of foul language the vine-dresser
returns him, still however calling as he re·
tires “cuckoo, cuckoo !'' He was con·
sidered a tardy person who had not got his
vines trimmed by the arrival of the cuckoo‚
and the joke consists in the passenger
telling the vine-dresser that the cuckoo
was coming, and would find his trees un-
pruned, which was as much as to call him
a lazy fellow. [Plin. H. N. 18. 8. 26. 66.]
Lambinus aptly quotes‘Ausonius' poem on
the Mosella (Idyu. x. 161) :

“ Surxliimis quippe jugis tendentis in ultima

c vi

Conseritur viridi fluvialis margo Lyaeo.

Laeta operum plebes festinantesque coloni

Vertice nunc summo properant, nunc
dejuge dorso

Certantes stolidis clamoribus: inde viator

Rissarum subjecta terens, hinc navita

bens

Pro-bre canunt seris cultoribus .- adstre-
Etpiiissszet silva tremens et concavus
amnis.

The Greeks had a proverb to the same
effect, explained by the Schol. on Aristoph.
Av. 507. “ The verse in Virgil, ‘ Hinc alta.
sub rupe canet frondator ad auras ’ (Ec. i.
57), naturally occurs, when in our walks
under the rocky cliffs of Posilipo we see the
peasant swinging from the top of 8 tree on
a rope of twisted willows, trimming the
poplar and the luxuriant teudrils of the
vine, and hear him make the whole vale
ring with his rustic ditty. A classic scho-
lar cannot stroll under the groves of the
plain without calling to mind Horace's
‘ durus vindemiator,’ &c.‚ if he attend to
the vine-dresser sitting among the boughs
lashing raw lads and bashful maidens as
they return from market with the same
gross wit and rough jokes that gave such
zest of old to the farces of Atella ” (Swin·
burne, vol. i. p. 116). In ‘ Vindemiator’
the third syllable 8081838811 with the fourth.
See C. iii. 4. 41, and add S. ii. 3. 245 ι
“ Luscinias soliti impenso prandere coemp-
tas.” S. i. 8. 43: “ Imagine cerea Largior
arserit ignis.” S. ii. 2. 21: “Neque ostrea
Nec scarus aut poterit? &c. -

32. Italo peffusus aceto] ¹ Pus‚’ ‘ve-
nenum,’ ‘ sal,' ‘ acetum,' are 811 words well
chosen for describing the poisonous charac-
ter of these men's malice. Plautus uses the
last of these words two οι· three times.
Bacch. (iii. 3. 1) : “ Nunc experiar sitne
acetum tibi cor acre in pectore.” Pseud.
(ii. 4. 49) ε “ Ecquid habet is homo aceti in
pectore? Atque acidissimi.”

have in these days supposed, he alluded in
‘ reges' to the death of Caesar. It was not

still believe he had done the state a service
