1 76 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XIV.
A.U.c. 729 or 730.

This ode has been animadverted upon pretty severely, and even rejected as spurious,
because unequal to the occasion it was written for. It may not be one of Horace’s best·
But it was evidently only a private affair. It was composed at the close of the Canta-
brian war, A.U.c. 729, when Augustus' return was expected, or on his return the follow-
ing year. He was detained by illness at Tarraco. Franke gives, firom Nox-isius, a
fragment of an inscription which makes it appear probable that Augustus recovered his
health and returned in the summer of 730, in which year C. Norbanus Flaccus was
consul:

ARGUMENT.

Caesar is returning a conqueror from Spain, Ο ye people, he who but just went forth like
Hercules to the field. Let his chaste wife and sister go forth to offer sacrifice with
the matrons, while the young soldiers and their brides stand reverently by. I too
will keep holiday ς for I am safe while Augustus is lord of the world. Bring flowem,
boy, and ointment, and my best old wine, and go bid Neaera come : if the churlish
porter refuse thee, come away ; Ι have no mind for strife, though Ι might not have
borne as much in the heyday of my youth.

1. ο plebe] ‘ Plebs' and ‘populus ' are
used synonymously (O. ii. 2. 18 sq.), and
either word stands for the common formula
‘ populus plebsque Romana: aS, among
other places, Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 14, ‘⁸ Mihi
Floram matrem populo plebeique Romanae
ludorum celebritate placandam? Nothing
can be in worse taste than the idea of Klotz
(Lect. Ven. p. 317), followed by Gesner,
Jani, Tate, that Horace meant to oppose
the plebeians, who were anxious when they
heard of Augustus' illness, to the patricians
who were delighted. [‘ Herculis ritu ε’
‘novo ritu‚’ C. iii. 1. 45. 2 ς ‘ritu fluminis?
C. iii. 29. 33.]

2. Morte venalem] This is an expres-
sion like that of Aeschines (c. cies. 7'7.

26, Reiske)‚ -αἵματός ἐστιν ἡ ἀρετὴ «iuria.
Ι see no obJecti0n‚ as Orelli does, to ex-
tending the example of Hercules to both
clauses. As Hercules braved death, so did
Augustus, and like Hercules he is return·
ing from Spain victorious. ’

5. Um‘co quadem] Livia was never sus·
pected of infidelity to her husband, though
she has been sus ‚ probably without

just reason, of hastening his death. But

that which appears to have been the first
cause of disscnsion between her and Augus-
tus, the succession of Tiberius, was not yet
thought of. Horace therefore need not be
accused of bad taste or gross flattery for
what he says. Dillenbr. interprete ‘unico'
'amato,caro,' and the same in ‘⁸ Satisbeatus
