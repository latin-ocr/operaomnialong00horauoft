xviii PREF-ACE.

Collins in honesty and just reasoning as he is superior to Collins in
learning, abuse, and misrepresentation ².

This work of correcting Horace and other writers still goes on,
and will go on as long as there are printers to print. It is doubtful
whether we are going backwards or forwards in the critical art, for
some of the newest emendations are the worst. We have a proposal
by Lachmann and Haupt (Keller) to write ‘ Thynus' for ‘ Poenus’
in C. ii. 13, 14. I do not know what objection these critics made
to ‘ Poenus :' Bentley has let it pass unmolested. ‘Thynus' was
probably suggested by ‘ Thyna merce ' (C. 111. 7. 3), and ‘ Bithyna’
(C. i. 35. 7 ; Epp. i. 6. 33). Ηο10 1110 argument turns entirely on
the propriety of the expression ‘ navita Bosporum Poenus :² the
evidence is for the common reading. Horace continually uses
proper names to give life and complexion ‘to his poetry‚ and there
are instances in which he uses them, as far as we 0311 000, where
other proper names would do as well if they had suited his verse.
If the ‘navita’ must have some life put into him by 3 1131110, I could
not think of one better than Poenus, whether Horace used it in the
larger or more 1111111οᾶ sense} nor if 1110 poet wished to put his
‘ navita’ on the road 10 some great and. distant seat of commerce,
could he have 01100011 3 111010 troublesome course for him than beat-
ing up the Bosporus against a strong current. What the ‘navita
Thynus ³ would be doing there I cannot 1011, 30 the Thyni were 1101

² There is 311 example of Bentley's perverse argumentation on Epod. xv. 15, where,
aster proposing and defending ‘ offensi ' instead of ‘ offensae,' at the end of 1110 note he
says that ‘offensae’ may stand, if a man will interpret it as he (1000. His interpreta-
tion may certainly be accepted. In S. i. 9. 1, he inserts ‘ ut’ after ‘ibam‚' because he
does not like the expression ‘ ibam ' alone, and he defends his ‘ ut ’ by quoting among .
other passages one from Terence, Phormio, iv. 3. 12: ‘Ut abii abs 10, fit forte obviam mihi
Phormio‚’ which is quite 3 different thing. In the same satire, v. 36, he puts ‘vadatus'
a conjecture, in the place of ‘ vadato? because, as he says, in this formula ‘respondere ’
is used absolutely, and he gives examples, of which there are plenty, but 'not one where
the word ‘vadari' occurs. ‘Respondere vadato' would be as regular 30 ‘respondere
accusatori3' and Bentley can' only bring the text to his supposed standard of uni-
formity by changing ‘ vadato' into ‘ vadatus‚' and giving to ‘vadatus ’ a passive signi·
fieatiou, which it appears that it had in some writers before Horace, and some long
aster his time. It has been suggesoed that ‘ vadato ’ is an ablative in a passive sense
(Kr'stger), a suggestion in which there may be something3 and it leaves the genuine
reading untouchcd. .
