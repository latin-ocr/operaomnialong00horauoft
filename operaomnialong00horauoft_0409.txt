word fior education. C. i. 10. 2: ‘¹ Qui feros

See C. iii. 24. 54 n.

[— jubebat at facerem] This con-
struction is sometimes used even by prose
writers.

123. ]Πποιηι ean-judicibus selectis] It was
the duty of the PraetorUrbanus annually to
select a certain number of persons whose
names were ⁹ in the Album J udi-
cum Selectorum, and from whom were
chosen by lot the ‘ judices ' for each crimi-
nal trial. It is uncertain whether at this
time, or subsequently, their fonctions were
extended to civil as well as erimiual pro·
ceedings. 'l'he number of these ‘judices ’
varied. By the ‘lex Servilia Glaucia
Repetundarum’ it was fixed at 450. The
law that was in force at the time Horace
refers to was the ‘lex Aurelia‚' (1³.c. ¹70),
by which the J udioes Selecti were eligible
from the Senators, Equites, and Tribuni
Aen-ariis The changes that took place in
respect to the J udices, and the frequent
shisting of the judicial power between the
Senate and the Equites, are stated very
clearly in ΜΓ. Long's Excursus on the
‘ Judicia' (Cic. in Verr. Omtionoe). Ho-
race's father, as plain meu are wont, looked
up with reverence to the body in whom
were vested such high functions ς but the
office was, not an enviable one, nor always
most purely exercised. See C. iv. 9. 39 n.
As to ‘ auctor,’ see above, v. 80. [‘ Objicie·
bat’ has here the same sense as ‘propone-
bat :' Liv. iv. 51.]

‘ an ’ is here put for ‘utrum,’ and opposed
to ‘ necne.’ His editor Wfist'emann corrects
