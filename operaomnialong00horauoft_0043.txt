children, and thus to svengo in the noblest manner his great-uncle's murder. The

'nne prodigies described at thebeginningofthis ode arethose which weresaidtohsve

489, which passage, and the verses that follow it to the end of the book, shouldbe read in
mmcxion with this ode. It will appear to any render of both very probable that Horace
had this description in his mind when he wrote. It has been thought that Horace could
not have referred to prodigies which had occurred so long before (Am-c. 710, fifleen years
before this ode was written), when he was at Athens, and therefore could not have
vitame-1 them. Other prodigies therefore have been affiumed as the subject of these
opming stanna. But the only other occasions, about this time, when the Tiber is
recorded to have overflowed its banks, were mmc- 727 and 732, the earliest of which
years would be too late for this ode, in which the allusions to the state of Rome and
flu triumphs of Augustus (v. 49), and the propom that he should assume supreme
authority, would in that ease have been out of date and unnecessary. One of the
chief purposoe profaesed by Augustus was the avenging of his adoptive father’s death3

adama civilia actum? which his enemies turned against him, saying, “Cassii et
Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis datos, quanquam fas sit privata odia in publicis
utilit-tibus remittere? According to Dion (lamias (liii. 4) his declared purpose was
ὄντας τᾷ τε πατρὶ δεινοῖς σφα-γένη τιμωρῆσαι καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐκ μεγάλων καὶ ἐπαλλήλων
κακῶν ἐξελέσθαι. Ovid (Fut. v. 573, sqq.) introduces him as uttering this prayer

This being the ease, Horace could not judiciously have possed over the death of C. Julius
