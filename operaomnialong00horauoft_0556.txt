Comm. Cruq. says “Thrax Gallina fnit
secutor, Syrus autem retiarius, uterque
gladiator.'’ ‘ Thraces? ‘ secutores? and
‘ retiarii,’ were three different kinds of
gladiators. The first had their name from
being armed like the Thracians with a
short sword and round shield, from which
they were sometimes called ‘parmularii.'
See Sueton. Vit. Domit. c. 10: “ Patrem-
Tamilias, quod Thracem mirmilloni parem,
munerario imparem dixerat, detractum e
spectaculis in arenam canibus objecit, cum
hoc titulo: Impie locutus parmularius.’' -
The MSS. vary between Thrax and Threx.
Torrentius says the oldest MSS. have Threx.
Orelli says Thrax is best supported. [Ritter
has Threx.] Maecenas is supposed to ask
Horace, among other trifling questions,
whether he has seen the famous gladiators,
and which is the better of the two.

45. mordent] ‘ Mordere’ is said of both
heat and cold. See Epp. i. 8. 5, “ oleamque
momorderit aestus.” ¹ Rimosa' is intelli-
gible enough. Comm. Cruq. compares it
with ‘ patula ’ in Epp. i. 18. 70, “Nec re-
tinent patulae commissa fideliter anres,’'
and says the expression is from Terence

(nun‘. i. 2. 24) :-

“ Sin falsum audierim ac fictum, continuo
palam 'stt
Plenus rimarum sum, hac atque illac
perfluo.''

48. noster] This is a familiar way of
expressing· ‘myself.' Plautus has it in
several places. See for one Epid. 1. 2. 52,
“Novi ego nostros; mihi dolet, cum ego
vapulo.” 'l he editions till Bentley all seem
to have had a stop after ‘invidiae‚' joining
‘noster’ with ‘spectaverat' which leaves
the first sentence too bare and elliptical.
‘ spectaverat ’ and ‘ luserat ' are the read-
ings it appears of the best MSS. There is

very Ilttle authority for ‘spectaverit‚' and .
only one MS. that Bentley can produce has
‘luserit' The subjunctive is more usual,
as in S. i. 1. 45, but the indicative occurs
below, S. 7. 68. ‘ Luserat' refers to ball-
play. ‘ Fortunae filius ’ was a conventioual
phrase. Sophocles uses it (Oed. Tyr. 1080),
ἐγὼ δ’ {naman παῖδα τῆς τύχης νέμων.
[‘ Invidiae. N oster,' Buten]

50. Fri-oldus α Rostris] Suppose some
bad news has been published in the Forum
and got abroad in the strects. The ‘ros-
tra‚’ which Niebuhr (i. 40611.) describes as
“ a stage of considerable length, with steps
at each end of it, lying in the line between
the temple of Castor and the Curia Hos-
tilia,'’ originally separated the comitium
where the patricians met from the space
where the plebeian assemblies were held,
which was properly the Forum, though
that name was popular-ly applied to the
whole. C. Julius Caesar removed the
‘rostra’ to a corner of the Forum under
the Mons Palatinus, and the building he
erected was called after him. Here per-
sons of all ranks met, and from this centre
reports would naturally take their rise.
Τ he ‘ rostra' had its plural nume from the
beaks of vessels taken from the people of
Antium (Liv. viii. 14), with which the stage
was ornamented. As to the ‘compita’ see
note on S. ii. 3. 25. '

53. Dacis] See Introduction.

55. Triquetra] See Introduction. This
is the ablative. ‘ Triquetra’ signifies tri-
angular, and is a name for the island of
Sicily, called also Trinacria, from the three
promontories. caesar describes Britain
also as “insula triquetra ’³ (Β. G. v. 13).
Homer's Θρινακίῃ νῆσος (odyss. xii. 127)
is usually supposed to be the same word as
Trinacria3 [but it is plainly different]

[56. Praedia] ‘ Praedium’ mu y be either
