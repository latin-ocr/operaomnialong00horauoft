HORATII FLACCI

Effutire leves indigna Tragoedia versus,

Ut festis matrona moveri jussa diebus,
Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda proterviS.
Non ego inornata et dominantia nomina solum

Verbaque, Pisones, Satyrorum scriptor amabo ,··

2:35

Nec sic enitar tragico differre colori

Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et audax
Pythias emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque dei Silenus alumni.

Ex noto fictum carmen sequar, ut sibi quivis

240

Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret
Ausus idem: tantum series juncturaque pollet,
Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris.
Silvis deducti caveant me judice Fauni

Ne velut innati triviis ac paene forenses

245

Aut nimium teneris juvenentur versibus unquam,
Aut immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta ;
Offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et rea,

Helieone legnnto.’' As to the construction
with ‘indigna' see C. iii. 21. 6 ιι., and
Epp. i. 3. 35 n.

[232. moveri jue-m] The matron, if she
(lances, must move with decency and
dignity. ]

234. dominantia nomina solum verbaque]
As to ‘nominaverbaque' see S. i. 3. 103 ιι.

‘Dominantia nomina' is an adap tation of
the Greek κύρια ὂνόματας that is, literal
words as opposed to figurative. As to ‘ dif-
ferre' with the dative see S. i. 4. 48 n.

238. Pythias emuncto] Corum. Cruq.
says this is the name of a slave girl who
got money out of her master Simo as a por·
tion for his daughter, in a play of Lucilius,
for which Orelli thinks we should read
Caecilius. Asto ‘emuncto' see S. i. 4. S.n.

239. Silenus] This god is said to have
educated Bacchus. He represented the
‘ crassa Minerva ' of the ancients‚ ‘ wisdom
under a. rough exterior‚’ and it is in his
graver character that Horace here views
him. AJl ancient representations of Silenus
exhibit him as a gross impersonation of
sensuality and low fun, usually drunk and
riding upon an affl, with Fauns dancing
about him. Modern ideas have coufounded
him with Bacchus his foster child.

240. Ex noto fictum carmen sequar]
‘ Ex noto ' (if 1 understand it right, but l
am not sure) means ‘ in ordinary language‚'
such as any man thinks he could write, but

not every man when he comes to try suc-
ceeds, for it is the connexion (see v. 48)
and ordering of the words and incidente and
illustrations that gives so much charm to
common language. ‘Ex noto' might mean
that the subject must be familiar. The
context indeed is about ποι-(11η but we
cannot depend on the context ιιι this poem,
the parts are so loosely put together (nee
Introduction). ‘flushionetL'
‘put together. ⁹]
[243. de medio sumptis] ‘Open to all:
‘common. ’]

244. Fauni] See C. ii. 19. 4n. These
rough beings introduced from the woods
should not talk as if they had been born iu
the city and were loungcrs in the Forum,
or languish in love verses like a mawkish
youth ; but neither should low language
be put into their mouth, for this will offend
the refined part of the audience, even if
the vulgar applaud. ‘ J uvenari ' is a word
not found elsewhere: it is adaptod from
the Greek νεανιεύεσθαι. ‘ Forenses’ is used
as Livy uses it (ix. 46)= “ Fabius simul
concordiae causa, simul ne humillimorum
in manu comitia essent, omnem forensem
turbam excretam in quattuor tribus con-
jecit, urbanasque eas appellavit.”
