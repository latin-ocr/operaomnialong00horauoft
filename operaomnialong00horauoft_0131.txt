CARMINUM ’ ΙΙ. 5. 95

CARMEN V.

ι 'nae zurich MS. (of the tenth century) has 'an inscription AD Gamnnnn and Estre
(p. 508) and Walckenaer (Histoire de la Vie et des Poesies d’Horace) accept Gabinius

’ “ ’ as the person to whom this ode is addreesed. 11· such a person existed among Horace’s

stiones, he may have been, Orelli suggests, son or grandson of A. Gabinius, the factious
contemporary of Cicero. The Scholiasts give us no help ς and the above inscription
stands alone. Acron had no knowledge of it, for he says, “ Incertum oet quem allo-
quaem- hao ode.’' There may be something, however, in it 3 bat the discovery of the
name, were we certain of it, would be of no value beyond leading to the infereuce that
the ode had perhaps some foundation in fact. Of the names introduced between the
flflzeenth and twentieth verses, Cruquius’ Scholiast has justly obser-ved, “haec nomina
pro exemplis posuit.” This remark is very sensible, and might have saved some scholars
a great deal of trouble. Heyne, for instance, on Tibullus (i. 8; see C. i. 33. 7 n.), makes
Pholoe and Chloris identieal with the daughter and mother mentioued C. iii. 15. 7.

ARGUMENT.

'l'hat girl ia too young for a yokefellow 3 an unbroken heifer is she that cares only for

· the putum, and her gambol& and the 0001 stream ; an uni-ipe grape that autumn soon
will ripen. She will soon come of her own accord when time shall have taken a few
years fromthy youth and added them to hers: then will she wax wauton and seek a
mate, and thou wilt love her above coy Pholoe, or Chloris as fair as the moon, or Gy ges,
whom the elever-est guest at thy table oould not distinguish from a girl.

Nonum: subacta ferre jugum valet
cervice, nondum munia comparis
Aequare nec tauri ruentis
In venerem tolerare pondus. ι
Circa virentes est am'mus tuae ⁴ 5
Campos juvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
solantis aestum, nunc in udo
Ludere cum vitulis salicto
Praegestientis. Tolle cupidinem
Immitis uvae : jam tibi lividos
Distinguet Auetumnus racemos
Purpureo varius colore.

[2. comparis] ‘Compar' is one who is
ι match for another, a oompanion, a hus-
band or a wife : ‘ she is not yet able to dis·
charge (aequare) the office of a wife.’]

5. C'irea] This is the Greek περὶ, as in
Aristyph313quit. 87: ἰδού ’γ’ ἄκρατον· περὶ
πῗνεῖῗαζιέιᾙίῖἕῖε is the poemen word
for aatisfying hunger or thirst, as Virgil
(Georg. i. 159): “concussaque famem in
silvis solabere quercu.”

12. Pupieno vor-'ue colore] Bentley

conjectures ‘ varios ' for ‘ varius,' quoting
Ov. (Met. iii. 484) ε
—-“ ut variis solet uva racemis

Ducere‚purpureum nondum matura eolo-
rem.

But ‘varius’ is poetieal. Propertius has
a similar verse (iv. 2. 13) : “Prima mihi
variat liventibus uva moeniis? Horaoe's

lines may be translated, ‘ Ere long autumn
with its varied hues will dye the green

grape with purple?
