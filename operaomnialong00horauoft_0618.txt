HORATII FLACCI

Qui fodicet latus et cogat trans pondera dextram
Porrigere. “ Hic multum in Fabia valet, ille Velina ς
Cui libet hie fasces dabit eripietque curule

Cui volet importunus ebur.” Frater, Pater, adde 3

Ut cuique est aetas ita quemque facetus adopta.

‘laevum latus‚' see S. ii. 5. 17 n. A great
many MSS„ including all the Parisian and
the old editions, have ‘saevum’ or ‘se-
vum,' which* some persons defend in the
sense of ‘dui-um,' and support it by the
word ¹ cogat‚’ as if the candidate were re-
luctant. But the man who should place
his chief happiness in the attainment of
public posts would not hesitate much about
shaking hands with any one. [Ritter has
‘ servum.’] ‘ Cogat ’ merely expresses the
energy of the ‘ nomenclator.' All the old
editions, all Lainbinus' MSS„ and many
others, have ‘fodiat ' [or perhaps ‘fodiet '].
Torrentius has that reading, but quotes
‘ fodicet' froin three MSS„ in one of which
there was this note : ‘⁶ fodicare est leviter
ac superficie tenus fodere,” which is con-
· trary to the meaning in Cicero (Tuse. iii.
16), and Plautus, Bacch. i. 1. 30 (quoted by
Forcellini)‚ and Cas. ii. 6. 9, ‘⁶ Stimulus
ego nunc sum tibi : Fodico corculum‚'’ in
all of which places it expresses a deep im-
pression on the mind. Here it means a
hear-ty thrust corresponding to ‘ cogat!
51. trans pondera> deoetram porriyere]
Orelli understands ‘pondera ’ to mean the
weights standing in front of a shop, so that
the man when he came to the shop of any
one who could command votes must streteh
his hand over them to greet the shop-
keeper. Acron interprets ‘ pondera ' by
‘⁶ lapides qui porriguntur per vias, vel qui
per latera (the sides of the road) expositi
altiores suut ;’' following whom some inter-
preters understand the man to hold out his
hand to help the other over an obstruction.
lt is rather to shake hands with him.
Obstructions were common in the nar-
row streets of Rome, such as Horace de-
scribes Epp. ii. 2. 72 sqq„ and Juvenal
(iii. 245) ε·-
Ferit hic cubito, ferit assere

 

Alteguafhie tignum capiti incutit, ille me-
tretam ;''

and Martial (v. 22),—

“ Vixque datur longas mulorum rumpere
mandras,
Quaeque trahi multo marmora fune
vides?

Plutarch, quoted by Lambinus, says αι’-
σχρόν ἐστι τὸ τὴν χεῖρα τῷ δήμῳ προτείνειν
ψῆφον αἰτοῦντας (Moral. iv. p. 171), which
explains the text. [Gesner's explanation of
‘ trans pondera' is ‘ultra aequilibrium cor-
poris cuin periculo cadendi.' The com-
mentators compare Ovid, Met. i. 13.]

52. Hie multum in Fabia valet] Servius
Tullius divided the Romans into thirty
tribes, of which four were of the city and
twenty-six were of the country. Ten of
these twenty-six disappeared aster the con-
quests of Porsenna, and of the remaining
sixteen the Fabia was one. The whole
number was gradually increased to
thirty-five, but it was not till A.U.o. 513,
towards the end of the first Punic War,
that the Quirina and Velina were added.
These were the last tribes that were
formed.

53. hiesu-roes dabit] The ‘sella curulis‚’
or chair of state, was omamented with
ivory, and expressions like Horace's are
common. It was called by the Greek
writers ἐλεφάντινος δίφρος. Ovid (ex Pont.⁴
iv. 9.-27)·says,—

“ Signa quoque in sella nossem formata
Etcfgfdhi Numidae sculptile dentis
opuS.''

The officers cntitled to use this chair (‘ cu-
rules magistratus') were the consors, con·
suls, praetors, and curule aediles. Officers
of lower rank had them in the provinces.
‘Importunas' means ‘obstinate’ or ‘ill-
natured ;’ ‘ facet-us‚’ ‘ polite?

56. lucet, eamus quo ducit μαῖα] ‘The
day has dawned, let us be off and lay in
our supplies3 let us hunt and fish, as
Gargilius hunted when he bought a boar,
and pretended he had caught it himself ς’
that is to say, let us go to market. Who
is meant by Gargilius we have no means
of knowing. The name occurs in Roman
inscriptions. The man wished to establish
his reputation as a huntsman: got up
before daybreak and returned to the city
before the morning was over, and passed
through the Forum while it was full of
people, with nete, spears, and men, and a
mule carrying a boar which he had not
