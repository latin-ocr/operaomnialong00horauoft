HORATII FLACCI

Fomenta vulnus nil malum levantia,
Desinet imparibus certare summotus pudor.
Ubi haec severus te palam laudaveram,

J ussus abire domum ferebar incerto pede

Ad non amicos heu mihi postes et heu
Limina dura, quibus lumbos et infregi latus.

Nunc gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam
Vincere mollitie amor Lycisci me tenet,

Numism. Dissert. vii.). ἐβούλετο δὲ καὶ
Ἀλέξανδρος ’Ἄμμωνος υἱὸς εἶναι καὶ κεράσ-
φορος ἀναπλάττεσθαι πρὸς τῶν ἀγαλματο-
ποίων (Clem. Alex Protrept. p. 36).

15. Quodsi meis] He means to say that
his wrath has got the better of his love and
modesty; and he will cast his complaints to
the winds, and cease to contend with rivals
that are unworthy of him. This supposes
the common reading ‘inaestuet' to be
wrong, which Ι believe it is. [Ritter and
Keller have ‘inaestuet.’] Doering and
Gesner have ‘inaestuat‚’ and it appears to
me that the indicative is the proper form
here. The subjunctive could only be
rendered as an hypothetical threat (as
Cruquius says) that if he could only get
up his wrath sufficiently to cast 1118 com-
plaints away, he would abandon Inachia 3
which does not appear very good sense.
‘ Si’ is not hypothetical‚ but affirmative,
and the whole is 8 positive resolution made
one moment and broken the next3 other-
wise the inconsisteucy of the lover's con-
duct is lost. F‘omenta' means ‘igs hs'
81111 ‘complaining s' with which grief is
soug ht to be relieved. Lambinus, Turne-
bus, and others take ‘'fomenta for‘ ali-
mentaj ‘thoughts which foster love and
sorrow 3' but that is disproved by the words
that follow : ‘vulnus nil malum levantia?
Such ineffectual remedies are elsewhere
called “frigida curarum fomenta '³ (Epp.
i. 3. 26). ‘Fomenta ’ are there glory 81111
811811 like rewards. ‘Libera bilis‚' ‘unre-
strained wrathss as above (Ep. iv. 10),

“liberrima indignatio. ” ‘Imparibus’ sig-
nifies his rivals who are beneath himin
mind though his betters m fortune. With
the exception of ‘ imparibus’ and ‘ fomenta,'
Turnebus (Adv. xxv. 20) gives the usual
acceptation of the passage: “ Fomenta—si

(Spanheim de

virili quadam ira in praecordiis aestuante [

dimiserit, praesertim ingrata nec vulnus
amoris levantia-‘me‚’ inquit, ‘paulo in-
verecundius geram, nec ita pudenter sum—
mittam amicae, sed eam aspernabor desi-

namque sectari imparem neque redaman-
tem.’ '' ‘Desinet certare summotus pudor’
is equivalent to ‘ desinam certare summoto
pudore? ‘ Imparibus' is the dative 8888.
See C. i. 1. 15 11. ’ Inaestuo' is not used
elsewhere, but Horace is free in his use of
prepositions 111 composition, aster the man·
ner of the Greeks. ‘ Palam' is used both
as an adverb and a preposition. ‘Lauda-
veraFm' is ‹laelqtrdivalenttto ‘gactaveramss which
use orce . oes no no 188.

20. incerto pede] With steps that would ’
go one way and are forced to go another.
Some have interpreted ‘ incerto’ ‘ reeling’
from the effects of wine, and so destroy the
effect of the whole , 111 which the
poet obviously represents himself as making
fine boasts before his friend, but striving in
vain to keep them when he leaves him. So
Tibull. (ii. 6. 11) :-

“ Magna loquor 3 sed magnifice mihi magna
Exiiietiliiiit clausae fortia verba fores.

J 111-8111 quoties rediturum adlimina nun-

Cuiiiubizxiie juravi, pes tamen ipse redit?

Baxter, as usual, takes ‘incerto' διλόγως,
88 applying to the unsteadiness of the foot
and purpose too. ‘Non amicos heu mihi
postes’ is elsewhere “asperas porrectum
ante fores” (O. iii. 10. 2), where‘ porreci
tum’ explains ‘lumbos et infregi latus,’‘
weariedxp my body by lying on the hard
ground! [‘ Fores et limina L cisni:
Ritter3 but the interpretation in e Ar-
gument is perhaps right]

24. mollitie amor] The hiatus in this
verse, and the short syllable’ m v. 26, are
explained by the rule that, the two verses
being composed of two separate mensures,
the last syllable in each 18 common, and
independent of the syllable that follows.
