‘libelli' they carried were their note-
books. ‘Ambulat' signifies their strut-
ting through the streets with the con·
sciousness that men were aii-aid of them.
The palmy days of the ‘delatores’ had
not yet come, but they were suffieicntly ·
abundant in Horace's time. [Ritter thinks
that these men were officers of the aediles,
and that they arrested thieves and rob-
bers.] ‘Ut sis‚’ sa‘y .‚that’ or ‘though

'IltyNulla taberna meos habeat] The
‘taberna' was sometimes under a porticus,
in which case the titles of the books for
sale within were hung ungupon the columns
(‘pilae') in front. Horace alludes to this
when he says (A. P. 372): “Mediom-ibus
esse poetis Non Dii, non homines, ιιοιι con-
cessere columnaess' which means that m-
different poets would not bc patronin by
the booksellers. Max-tia] advises his friend
Lupercus to buy a copy of his Epigrams
at the shop of Atrectus.
