HORATII FLACCI

Mane domo vigilare, clienti promere jura,

Cautos nominibus rectis expendere nummOS,

105

Majores audire, minori dicere, per quae
Crescere res posset, minui damnosa libido.
Mutavit mentem populus ‘levis et calet uno
Scribendi studi03 pueri patresque severi

Fronde comas vincti coenant et carmina dictant.

Ipse ego qui nullos me adfirmo scribere versus
Invenior Parthis mendacior, et* prius orto

Sole vigil calamum et chartas et scrinia posco.
Navim agere ignarus navis timet, abrotonum aegro

Non audet nisi qui didicit dare ς quod medicorum est

Promittunt medici ς tracta-nt fabrilia fabri z
Scribimus indocti doctique poelmata passim.
Hic error tamen et levis haec insania quantas
Virtutes habeat sic collige z vatis avarus

104. Mane domo viyilare] See S. i. 1.
10 n. Horace compares the change which
had come upon the character of the Ro-
‘mans through their new taste for poetry,
with that which passed upon the Athe-

nians when they turned from arms to the·

arts of peace, and he justifies the change.
[‘Clienti—jura:’ to bring forth, that is, to
declare to a client, the rules of law 3 the
same as ‘de jure respondere.’]

105. Cautos nominibus rectis] ‘Expen-
dere’ is equivalent to ‘ expensum referre‚’
which means to debit a person in one's
books with money lent (S. ii. 3. 69 n.).
‘ Cavere'i is the usual word for giving or

taking security. ‘ Nominibus rectis' means
good debtors. ‘Nominibus ' may dcpend

upon ‘ expendere,' or ⁶ cautos,' or both, for
a debtor is said ‘cavere alicui: to give
security to his creditor, and the creditor is
said ‘expensum referre alicui? ‘Nomen'
signifies an item or entry in a book of
accounts, and ‘referre nomina’ to make
such entries. It also is used for a debt,
and ‘nomen solvere’ is to pay a debt;

‘ nomen facere,’ either to incur a debt or
to lend money; for ‘ facere' is used in both
senses: but ‘ nomen' is also used for the
debtor himself, as in Cicero (ad Fam. v.
6. 2), “Meis rebus gestis hoc sum assecutus
ut bonum nomen existimer.'’ Porphyrion
explains ‘nominibus rectis ' as ‘ de legibus
factis non de foenerando debitoribus.' He
therefore read ‘ rectis ’ not ‘'certis,’ which
appears in most of the early editions (not
all, as Fea says, for Ascensius, 1519, has
‘rectis ') till Cruquius restored ‘rectis'

from every one of his MSS. It appears in
all Orelli's‚ and all but four late ones of
Pottier's, and many others. Bentley from
one doubtful MS. reads ‘scriptos’ for
‘eaut0s‚' appealing to “ scribe decem Ne-
rio '’ (S. ii. 3. 69).

[106. Mujores, &e.] The younger came
to hear the wisdom of the elder, and the
elder taught the younger (‘minori dicere’).
See Cic. de Am. e. 1.]

111. carmina dietant] ‘ Dictat-e ' is
equivalent to ‘scriberej because they did
not usually write themselves, but dictated
to a slave who wrote. See S. i. 10. 92 n.
[‘ Fronde‚' διο. : C. i. 7. 7.]

113. Parthis mendacior] This expres-
sion, which seems as if it were proverbial,
savours of the jealousy the Romans of this
day felt towards the Parthians. Elsewhere
Horace calls them ‘infidi,’ C. iv. 15. 23.
As to ‘ calamus’ and ‘ charta‚' see S. ii. 3.
2, 7, and for ‘ scrinia' see S. i. 4. 21 n.

114. abrotonum] This is the plant
which we call southern-wood, and Ι un-
derstand it is used in our pharmacopeia as
a remedy for w.orms Pliny (xxi. 21) de-
scribes its use for medical purposeS.

[115. medicorum — medici] Bentley

conjectured, but did not print ‘melieorum

—melici,' a signal instance of want of

judgment]

119. avarus non temere est animus]
Ovid takes credit to poets for this same
quality: “Nec nos ambitio, nec amor nos

tangit habendi'' (A. A. iii. 541). ‘Non
