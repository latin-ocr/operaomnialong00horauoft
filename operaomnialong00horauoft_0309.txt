Ι CARMEN II.

3, , Horace, meaning to write on the praises of the country, put his poem (whether as
J nn dher—thought or not may be open to conjecture) into the shape of a rhapsody by ιι
-, monos-gotting nsnrer who, aster reciting the blessings of a country life and sighing for
ἑ *lun enioyment of them, resolving to throw up his business and persuading himself that
, b (laires nothing so much as retirement and a humblc life, finds habit too strong for
,η him md falls back upon the sordid pursuits which aster all are most congenial to him.
Smne may perhaps think that this little bit of satire is the chief object for which the
.“ poem was written. My impression is that it was commenced (whether in imitation of
¹ ” V'xrgil, Georg. ii. 458 sqq„ as Franks supposes, or of a poem of Archilochus [Fr. 21.
· Bergk] as Lachmann, or not in imitation of any thing, which is more probable) as a
ἶ ⁷ “nudatio vitae rusticae ” (which is the tenor of most of the inscriptions), and that the
⁴ last four verses, which have been called clumsy‚ were added to give the rest a moral.
‘g' At any rato the greater part of the speech must be admitted to be rather out of keep-
* ingwith the supposed speaker. We should not expect, for instance, to hear a city
ἓ ¹: 1111101 talk about an hereditary farm, the dangers of the soldier and the sailor, and the ’
’ξ’ s amos love. 'nae last difficulty is got rid of by Doering and others, who interpret
ῗέ ‘mor’ (v. 8⁷) as the love of money, which that editor says “ vix dubitari potest, ''
’ἓ {- though the word ‘habendi’ “paulo licentius omisit? This 1 am quite sure is wrong,
ἐξ anal 1 think we must allow that Horace was more intent upon his description than on
i ninhining an accurate consistency between the circumstances of the speaker and
tho ncntimmts he utters. But, however this may be, the picture is very beautiful and
ζ thamul very true.1n the most sordid minds more genial impulses will sometimes
,3 11-- but the beauties of nature and the charms of a peaceful retirement are, like
k virum iia-alf, only attractive‘ ιιι the distance and at inter-vals to minds that have grown
m ιο the pursuit of gain for its own sake. To 'such minds domestic and innocent
m offer no lasting gratification‚ and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the one
had, and of the jaded but still grasping usurer struggling for a moment against his
munifice on the other, affords n wholesome lesson for many. In respect to the date,
Ji& con mlx be conjectured that Horace had tasted the enjoyments he describes so gra-
phan! und was in possession of his farm. But even that is uncertain. Franke,
{thinkingthat Horace must have had before him Virgil' s second Georgic (458 sqq.,)
&which mmo say was not published till ,1Ηο 0. 724, attributes this ode to '724 also, in
f 'hida his friend Lachmann informs him he seems‘ ‘nimis subt iliter ignorabilia rimatus
s ἐἶ’ 'l'here' is a fragment from the comedy Νῆσοι attributed to Aristophanes (344,
‚ss M), witichis very like this ode. Whether Horace ever saw it or thought of it when
·howuw2iiing, itisimpoesibletosay.1t runs thus· -

ὅ μῶρε μῶρε. ταῦτα πάντ’ ἐν τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οἰκεῖν μὲν ἐν &yffi τοῦτον ἐν τῷ γηδίῳ
ἅπαλλαγέντα τᾶν κατ’ &qoph πραγμάτων,
κεκτημένον (ευ-γέρων οἰκεῖον βοοῖν·

ἔπειτ’ ἀκούειν προβατίων βληχωμένων
τρυγός τε φωνὴν εἷς λεκάνην ὧθουμένης,
&hp τε χρῆσθαι armaions τε καὶ κίχλαις,
καὶ μὴ περιμένειν ἐξ ἆγορᾶς ἰχθύδια
τριταῖα, πολυτίμητα, βεβασανισμένα

ἐτ’ ἴχθυοπόλου χειρὶ παρανομωτάτῃ.
