HORATII FLACCI

NON usitata nec-tenui ferar
Penna biformis per liquidum aethera
Vates, neque in terris morabor
Longius, invidiaque major
Urbes relinquam. Non ego, pauperum , 5
Sanguis parentum, non ego quem vocas,
Dileete Maecenas, obibo
Nec Stygia cohibebor unda.
J am jam residunt eruribus asperae
Pelles, et album mutor in alitem ιο
Superne, nascunturque leves
Per digitos humerosque plumae.
J am Daedaleo o'cior Icaro
Visam gementis litora Bospori
Syrtesque Gaetulas canorus 15
Ales Hyperboreosque campos.

1. Non usitata] Aristophanes makes the
poet Cinesias say (Av. 1372). —-

ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς ’Ὄλυμπον πτερύγεσσι
κουφαις.

On the meaning of ‘ biformis' the interpre-
ters are not agreed. Horace can only mean
as swan and poet. [Keller and Ritter
have ‘pinna.']

4. invidia major] Horace was not too
good to be maligned, but he could rise above
it, which is the meaning of ‘ maj0r‚’ κρείσ-
σων. His birth drew contempt upon him
while he held a command in Brutus' army,
and afterwards when he became intimate
with Maecenas (Sat. i. 6. 46 sqq.) ς but
those who envied tried as usual to make use
of him (Sat. ii. 6. 47 sqq.). He appears
iu some measure to have outlived detrac-
tiou (C. iv. 3. 16) :

“ Et jam dente minus mordeor invid0.'’

6. Quem vocas] See Introduction. The
Scholiasts separated ‘ dileete‚' from Mae-
cenas, understanding the construction to
be “quem vocas ‘dilecta’ '³ as in Ovid

(Am. i. 7. 19):

“ Quis mihi non demens, quis non mihi
barbare dixit ?”

The supporters of this interpretation also
quote Luke vi. 46: τί με καλεῖτε Κύριε;

but there is no necessity for taking the
word from the substantive it wouldg most
naturally agree with. [Ritteragrees with
the Scholiasts, and perhaps he is right]
Bentley suspects the true reading to be

‘'vocant instead of‘ vocas, ’and applies it
to the preceding words, ‘pauperum san-
guis parentumss as “quem rodunt omnes
libertino patre natum” (Sat. i. 6. 46); but
there is no authority or reason for this
change. It was on the strength of such
invitations that he affirmed—

“ pauperemque dives
Me petit ” (C. ii. 18. 10).

11. Superne] As this is formed from
‘ supernus? the last syllable would accord-
ing to usage be long; but it is short in
Lucretius twice, and the same with ‘in-
ferne? It may therefore be short heren
and there is no necessity fc:- departing‚ as
Fea does, froin the reading of the best
MSS„ and taking ‘superna’ from a. few.
Forcellini observes that some MSS. have
‘apprime, ' with the last syllable short, in
Vix-gil, (Georg. ii. 134), “Flos apprime
tenax,” which is generally written ‘ad
prima’ [and the expression is compared
with Herodotus, vi. 13, ἐς τὰ πρῶτα
(Conington' s Vir gi.l) ]

13. Daedaleo ocior] Orelli has collected
many examples of similar hiatus from
Horace, Virgss, and Ovid. In Horace, see
C. i. 28. 24. Epod. v. 10ος xiii. 3. The
oldest Berne and zurich MSS. have ‘ notior’
and ‘ nocior,' which last is an evident cor-
ruption of the true reading; [Keller has

‘notior.’] Bentley conjectures ‘ tutior-³

15. canorus ales]

“ O mutis quoque piscibus

Donatura cycni si libeat sonum?
(C. iv. 3. 19 sq.)
