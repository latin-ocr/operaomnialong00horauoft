Lassus ab indomito, vel si Romana fatigat

HORATII FLACCI

lo

Militia assuetum graecari, seu pila velox
Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,
Seu te discus agit, pete cedentem aera disc03
Cum labor extuderit fastidia, siccus, inanis

Sperne cibum vilem; nisi Hymettia mella Falerno
Foris est promus et atrum

Ne biberis diluta.

or wearying yourself with riding, or if (sup-
posing you are only accustomed to Greek
sporta and the Roman are too much for
you) ball play occupies you or the discus,
then throw the discus; but when fatigue
shall have banished fastidiousness, and you
are dry and hungry, then see if ’³ &c.
‘ Romana militia ' corresponds to what
Cicero says (de Nat. Deor. ii. 64): “ut
exerceamur 111 venando ad similitudinem
bellicae disciplinae.” The ball play, which
was a common amusement in one shape or
other among the Romans, was introduced
from Greece, though the Romans had va—

, rieties perhaps of their own invention. The

most violent ·form however, ‘harpastum,'
was borrowed from the Greeks, who also
had the severer exercise of football, which
the Romans had not. The throwing of
the discus likewise was of Greek origin,
and belonged to the heroic age. The na-
ture of the discus is seen in the famous
statue of the δισκόβολος by Myron, of
which casts are common, and of which
there is a good copy in the British Mu-
seum. The specimen of Greek effeminacy
mentioned in C. iii. 24. 57, the ‘ trochus,'
is more to the purpose than the ‘ pila ' or
‘discus‚’ which were manly amusements.
2But Horace assumes (v. 12) that the man's
bau play is rather lazy. Bentley, doubt-
ing whether ‘extuderit' can bear the
meaning here required, reads ‘expulerit.’
The Scholiasts and the MSS. have ‘extu-
derit ' [except some MSS. in which ‘ extu-
lerit ² is a correction. Ritten] ‘Extundo'
is nowhere else used in this sense, but it is
a very apt word for the occasion. Hunger
beating fastidiousness out of a man repre·
sents the power of the one, and the con-
temptible character of the other, very well.

15. nisi Hymettia mella Falerno] This
constituted the drink called ‘ mulsum?
οἷνομέλι, which was commonly drunk at
the preparatory course called ‘ gustus' or
‘ promulsis ' (S. i. 3. 6 11.), 1118 former name
being taken from the dishes that were

caten as a whet to the appetite, and the
latter from tho mulsum that was taken

with them. (Gall. Sc. 9: The Banquet.)
The use of the strong Falernian wine for
this mixture, in which the usual propor-
tion was four of wine to 0118 of honey, is
condemned, S. 4. 25. Of the honeys used
by the Romans of Horace’s day (C. ii. 6.
18 n.) that of Hybla in Sicily was one of
the best; the worst was that of Corsica,
mentioned in various epigrams of Martial;
‘ mulsum' made with which was held to be
drink fit only for the vulgar.

16. promus] This was 0118 of the ‘ordi-
narii’ or upper domestic slaves, whose duty
it was to take charge of the wine-cellar and
larder. He was hence called ‘ cellarius‚'
also ‘ procurator peni,' ⁸ steward of the
provisions? Another name he bore was
‘condus‚’ because he had to take into store
(‘ condere ³) the provisions that were lest or
brought in for consumption, and, as the
same person who locked up also took out
the provisions (‘ promere ⁵), both names

were united in one, ‘conduspromns,’ as in
Plautus (Pseud. ii. 2. 14) ε

“ Ps. Conduspromus sum procurator peni.

Harp. Quasi te dicas atriensem. 1²⁸.
Immo atriensi ego imper0.''

He therefore had authority over other
slaves. The ‘atriensis' had charge of the
‘ atrium,' and was also one of the principal
slaves.

17. hiemat mare] Seneca (Epp. 114)
says that Sallust (somewhere not known
to us) writes, “aquis hiemantibus? and
that Arruntius, the author of a history of
one of the Punic wars, and an imitator of
Sallust, was always dragging in this word
⁶ hiemare.’ Pliny uses it occasionally.
Horace’s taste was insensibly affected by
his study of the Greek poets, and he copied
their χειμάζεται, though he may also have
seen and approved more than Seneca does
Sallust's “aquis hiemantibus.” [Persius‚
S. vi. 7 has ‘hibernat mare.’] With ‘la-
trantem stomachum: compare ‘iratum
ventrem' (S. ii. 8. 5). A hung-ry man is
vulgarly said to have a wolf in his belly to
this day.
