HORATII FLACCI

Utpote res tenues tenui sermone peractas.”

“Ede hominis nomen, simul et Romanus an hospes.” ιο
“Ipsa memorpraecepta canam, celabitur auctor. ⁴ '
Longa quibus facies ovis erit illa memento,

Ut succi melioris et ut magis alba rotundis,

Ponere; namque marem cohibent callosa vitellum.

Caule suburbano qui siccis crevit in agris 15
Dulcior ς irriguo nihil est elutius horto.

Si vespertinus subito te oppresserit hospes,

Ne gallina malum responset dura palato,

Doctus eris vivam mixto mersare Falerno ;

tion.

12. Longa quibus facies ovi-s· erit]
“Quae oblonga sint ova gratioris saporis
putat Horatius Flaccus,'’ says Pliny (x.
74), taking Horace athis word. On ⁴ ova'
see S. i. 3. 6 n. ‘ Succus ' here is equiva-
lent to ‘sapon' Why Horace should make
Catius say that long eggs were more white
than round ones, or what is gained by the
’ whiteness of au egg, or by its containing a
male rather than a female chicken‚ is not
clear. Bentley, being very liter-al, says the
fact is not as Catius states, if ‘alba' be the
right word, and therefore 116 changes it
into ‘alma‚' as from ‘ alo‚’ signifying that
they are more nutritious. ‘Ponere' is to
put upon the table, as ‘ posito pavone ' (S.
ii. 2. 23). The notion that from long eggs
cocks were hatched, and from round, hens,
appears to have been a vulgar error. Pliny

⁵ says: “Feminam edunt quae rotundiora

gignuntur, reliqua marem '' (x. 74); and
Columella (viii. 5. 11): “Cum quis volet
quam plurimos mares excludi longissima
quaeque et acutissima ova subjiciet ς et
rursus cum feminas quam rotundissima.'’
The contrary order is stated to be true by
Aristotle (Hist. Anim. vi. 2. 2), who says
the long and pointed egg brings forth a
hen, while all other eggs bring forth cocks.
Sir Thos. Browne disposes briefly of these
notione: “ That the sex is discernible from
the figure of eggs, or that cocks or hens
proceed from long or round oneS, as many
contend, experiment will easily frustrate ’'
(Vulg. Er. iii. 28). ‘ Callosa' significa
‘ tough‚' and belongs in sense, though not
in construction, to the yolk. [‘Cohibent :'
comp. C. i. 28. 2.]

15. Caule suburbano] The reading of
nearly all the old editions and of the best
MSS. is ‘ cole‚' Acron too had that read-
ing, and says: “Cole: hoc est caule, ut

clode pro claude, Sorices pro Saurices; coda
pro cauda.'’ The same variation appears
in Clodius and Claudius, Plotius and Plau-
tius, &c. Artificial streame and fish-pouds
were commonly introduced into the gas-dens
of rich people. Hence Catius says the
vegetables grown in the subm-bs were not
so pleasant as those grown in the country
on drier soil. ‘ Elutius' For-cellini inter-
prets ‘infirmius ad alendum? Horace
means that they were insipid from the
quantity of water they imbibed. “Su-
burbano: quia suburbana loca rivis abun·
dant” (Acron) 3 for the above reason 1
su ose.

lig. vespertinus subito te oppresserit]
On ‘vespertinus’ see Epod. xvi. 51; and
for examples of ‘ opprimere‚’ to overtake or
come upon one suddenly, see Forcell. “

18. malum responset] ‘Responsare' is
used by Horace several times in the sense
of resistance. See below, S. ’1. 85 : “ Re-
sponsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores ;’'
aud v. 104: “animus coenis responsat
opimis ;” and Epp. i. 1. 68: “fortunae te
responsare superbae Liberum et erectum
praesens hortatur.’' Here it may be taken
in a similar way, or in the ordinary sense
of ‘respondere,’ according as we under-
stand ‘malum.’ lt may only mean ‘ill
suits,’ or ‘malum’ may strengthen ‘re-
sponsat' as ‘male rauci’ (S. i. 4. 66),
‘responset’ signifyiug to disagree with.
Jacobs proposes to read ‘malum’ as an
expletive (malum l), leaving ‘ responsare’ to
spcak for itself in the latter sense. “Re-
sponset: resistat 3 reluctetur in faucibus”
(Acron).

19. vivam mixto mersare Falerno] The ‚

MSS. all have ‘mixto' or ‘misto‚' and
nearly all editions till Bentley's. Landi-
nus is said by those who have seen his ori-
ginal edition (Ι suppose) printed at Flo-
rence in 1482, to have editcd ‘mulsa' The
