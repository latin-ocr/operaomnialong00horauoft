Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.
Non ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

he cannot say that he has no turn for that
sort of thing, for he is wont to amuse
himself at home with such sports as sham
fights, though he is not given to excoes
aud wasting his time on such matters.

‘Extra numerum modumq ue’ is literally

‘out of time and tune.’ The two brothers

got up a representation of the battle of

Aetium on a pond, and made the slaves
(‘ puems’) act the soldier-s and sailors,
while they took the principal characters
themselves, M. Lollius acting r*Augustae
and his brother M. Antonius. [Suetonius
Auge. 18) says that Augustus founded
near Aetium, and instituted

gemes to be celebrated there every five
years. But according to Strabo (p. 325)
there were already games at Actium, and
Augustus only gave them fraeh distinction.
'fliete were, however, ‘Actiaci ludi' at
Rome (Dion. 51. c. 1 ς 53. (3. 1 3 Suetoniua
Tib. 6). Ritter supposes that Horace
means that as Lollius imitatos the fight
of Actium in the country, he can have no
excuse for not being present at the Actian
games in Rome. He conjectures that
“ Lollius' brother may be Scaeva, to whom
the seventeenth Epistle is addraeoed ς and
there'is some foundation for this con-
jecture. See the Introduction to Epist.
17. But the Romans used frater'loosely.
It may mean‘ cousin? Cicero calls his
cousin Lucius his brother (Ad Att. i. 5). ]
64. velox Victoria fronde coronet]
Victoria 18 represented as a young female

with wings, and with a palm-branch or a
wreath in her hand, or both, as in a medal
of Galba in Oiselius’ Thes. lxviii. 2.

66. Fautor utroque-pollice] In the
fights of gladiators the people expressed
their approbation by turning their thumbs
down, and the reverse by upliflzing them.
When a gladiator had got his adversar-y
down or disarmed him, he looked to the
spectators for this signal, aud according as
the thumb was up or down he despatched
or spared the man. I suppose he took his
orders, or the mass of the spectators took
their lead, from the personages who sat
near the‘podium.' (Epp.1.1. 611.) Thus

‘fautor utroque pollice’ is a proverbial
way of speaking, as Pliny says (xxviii. 2):

“Pollices cum faveamus premere etiam

proverbio jubemur.’' Juvenal (iii. 36) ε

“ Munera nunc edunt et verso pollice
Qtivgilngluihet occidunt populariter.”

perverted form. His ears are always open
to pick up remarks (‘ patulae ’,) and his
tougue always active to repeat them.
