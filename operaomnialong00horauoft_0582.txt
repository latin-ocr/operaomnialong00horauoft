54·ss HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, more honoured than all the world, Ι have received my discharge : seek not to
call me back 3 my years and my inclinations are not what they were. Let me hang
up my arms and retire. A warning voice within bids me loose the aged steed lest he
stumble at the end of his course. Verse I lay aside, and turn all my thoughts to
philosophy and virtue, and am ‘laying up stores of these.

(v. 13.) Ι belong, if you ask me, to no school, and own no master, but am borne along
wherever the breeze may set: now all activity and virtue with the Stoics, now insen-
sibly falling into the laxity of Aristippus· The days are weary till Ι shall have learnt
to act out what neither rich nor poor, young nor old, c‘an neglect with impunity.
Meantime I can only take the little knowledge Ι have for my guide and comfort.
If we cannot reach perfection, we may advance towards it. There are charms' 111
philosophy for every disease. Ambition, envy, passion, sloth, intemperance, lust‚— 311
that 15 most savage may be tamed if it turn a willing ear to instruction. The first
step 111 virtue and wisdom' 1s to abandon vice and folly. For instance, you who are
hastening to be rich, and flying from the disgrace of poverty, will you not learn from
the wise to despise those things you love so foolishly P Would the boxer who fights
111 the streets despise the Olympio crown which should be offered him without a
blow Ρ

(v. 52.) Believe me virtue is above the worth of gold, though the whole Forum may say
otherwise, and old and young may learn the lesson, crying, ‘Money first 31111 then

⁴ virtue.’ Be able, good, eloquent, honest, as you will, let your property fall short but
by 3 little of the equestrian and you are nobody. Never mind ς the children will 8311
you King if you do well. Let this be your stronghold, 3 conscience void of offence-
Which is best, Roscius’ law or the boys’, which the good old soldiers Curius and
Camillus approved? Which is your best adviser, he who bids you get money how you
can, that you may sit a little nearer the stage, or he who stands ever at your elbow
and bids and teaches you to defy the caprices of Fortune?

(v. 70.) And if Ι 118 asked why I hold not the opinions of the world Ι mix with, my
answer is that which the fox made to the lion : because Ι see 311 the sootmarks turned
towards your den and none the other way. Whom or what am Ι to follow Ρ One
manis getting rich by one foul way and another by another, and no one is consistent
even with himself. A man takes a fancy to build on the coast at Baiae: the next day
he is off inland to Teanum. If he is married, he wishes himself a bachelor ,· if not, he
wishes he was. And even the poor man, 118 must change his lodgings and his furniture,
and hire himself a boat to ape the rich man's yacht.

(v. 94.) And you too, my friend, you laugh at- me if the barber has cut my hair awry, or
ifmy vest is shabby while my tunic is fine: but graver inconsistencies you care not
for. In respect of these you think I am but as mad as my neighbours and want no
guardian, and this though you are my protector and are vexed with me for the
smallest neglect of my body, and though I look to you and hang upon you like 3
8111111.

(v. 106.) In short, to go back. The wise 111311 is only inferior to great Jove,—-rich‚ free,
respected, handsome, and a king of kings ς but above all sound ,except when his
stomach is out of order.
