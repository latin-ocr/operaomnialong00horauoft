EPODON LIBER, 4. 281

GARMEN IV.

- All the positive information we ean derivo from this ode in respect to the pur-port and
date is, that it contains a vehement invective against some person of low birth and eon-
numptius character, who gave himself airs, and disgusted the people of Rome: he was
abo ι military tribune. The approximate time is fixed by the last lines, which show
that it was written while Caesar Octavianus was preparing or carrying on war against
sextus Pompeius, who had enlisted in his service pirates and slaves, aa we learn from
DIon (49. c. 1-12. See below, ix. 10). To bring us nearer tothe exact date, it has been
argued (first by Massou in his life of Horace) that, inasmuch as in the second expedition
of ctum against Sex. Pompeius there were enlisted in his fleet a great body of slaves, it
is not probable that Horace would have used language of contempt which would apply as
much to Caesar’s as the enemy’ s force. It must therefore have been written, if this
assumption has any weight‚ before that armament was formed, which was amc. 717. In
'116 there deserted to caesar,‘ Pompeius' lientenant Menas or Menodorus (C. iii. 16.
15 n.), audit was in conoequence of the advantage gained by this man’s defection that
Caeam· declared war against Pompeius, in which war he sustaincd two severe defeats;
albai-which he suspended operations for a twelvemonth, and during that period it is said
with confidence this Epode was written. lt is also stated by allthe Scholiasts that Menas
is the subJect of this lampeon. The greater number of modern critics doubt their accuracy,
and aa the name ‘ Vedius Rufus ’ occurs in one or two inscriptions, that name has been
fixod upon instead of ‘ Menas) though no attempt is made to identify him with any his-
toric-u charaeta. The objections raised to Menas being the person alluded to are : 1. That
Horace would not have failed to notice the treachery as well as the pride of this person.
But that argument, which is Gesner’s, has no great force. Horace meant to attack the
swaggering airs of the man, which were more offensive to the citizens than his betrayal
of Pompeius, by which they had gained, and which could not have been noticed without
offending Caesar. 2. That Menas had been so short a time in Rome, that he could not
have been possessedof large lauded property, and having charge of the fleet would have

.> had no opportunity of making himself unpopular in the manner here described. But no

length of time was wanted for these objects. He had no doubt made himself rich before
ho betrayed his trust, having had plenty of opportunities sor doing so, and probably he
did notsell his conscience and his trust for nothing. He had had time to invest his
money, become a favoured guest of Caesar, and have his head turned; and a very few
exhibitione of himself in the character here described would be enough to call forth this
short lampoon. 3. That Menas was not an eques· But he was elevated to that rank by
(hasar, as we leam from Dion (xlviii. 45) ς aud at any rate, if he had but the regulatcd
income of an eques, he had the privileges of that order at least as regards a seat in the
theam. 4 It is affirmed that Menas could not be called a ‘tribunus militum,' inasmuch as
he whohad been under Pompeius the governor of two large islands (Sardinia and Corsica),
aswell as admiral of his fleet and commander of three legions, would have held a higher
post under Caesar, who had received and continued to treat him with great respect.
But it is a matter of history that Menas' desertion of Caesar and return to his old

, master arose out of his discontent with the rank given him by the former, audit is hard

to say what that rank may at any given time have been. It was always subordinate ς
and, though we learn he rose to be legatus to Calvisius Sabinus the chief admiral‚ he
may at first only have been a military tribune, which post however would at once give
him equestriau rank (S. i. 6. 25 11.). 5. It is said we do not know that Menas ever
was flogged3 but that he was once a slave (he was a freedman of Pompeius Magnus) was
enough to give riae to such an assertion in a satire of this kind, whether it was known to
be true or not. Thus Ι do not think there is sufficient internal evidence to impugn the
unanimous statement of the Scholiasts ς and though it must be admitted that, without
