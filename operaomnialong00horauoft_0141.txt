Licinius Murena, or A. Terentius Varro Murena, as he was called aster his adoption
by A. Teretitius Varro, was apparently a man of restless and ambitious character, and,
as we have sen, pnid the penalty of his rashness with his life (C. ii. 2, Introduction). It is
very probable that Horace wrote this ode to his friend to wax-n him of the tendendae of
his disposition. All else that we learn from Horace’s poems respecting Murena is that he
was of the college of augurs (C. iii. 19), and that he had a house at Formiae, where he
received Maecenas and his party on their way to Brundusium (S. i. 5. 37 sq.). As
Murem was put to death ΛΑΜ). 732 οι· 731, this ode must have been written before
that year.

Although it may be inferred from the tone of this ode that Murena was not incapable
of the conduct imputed to him and on the charge of which he died, his guilt does not
appear to have been proved. Dion (54. 1. 3) says that “in the year when M. Marcellus ’
and Ia. Arruntius were consuls, Fannius Caepio headed a conspiracy, which was joined by
others; and Murena was said to have entered into it with them, either tuly or slan-
dormoely. The conspirators did not appear to take their trial, and were condemned in
> their absence, but were taken and put to death shortly afterwards. Proculeius, his
brother, and Maecenas, who had married his sister, were unable to obtain Murena's
pardon? The same historian charges him with ungovernable and indiscriminate rashness
of speech: ἀκράτῳ καὶ κατακορεΐ παρῥησίᾳ πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως ἐχρῆτο (54 3). [comp.
