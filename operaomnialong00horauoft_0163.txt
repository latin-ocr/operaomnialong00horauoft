CARMINUM ΙΙ. 18. 127

GARMEN XVIII.
After A.n.c. 720(

This ode, which deals with Horace’s favourite subjecta, the levelling power of death,
and the vanity of wealth, and the schemen of the wealthy, is dedicated to no particular
ffiand, and is another proof of the little value or character that odes of this class derive
fiomamme3 though it was the poet’s pleasure at times to attach names to them.
What 1 mean is, that the name we find in conjunction with such odes must usually bc
lookod upon as non-essential, and that to draw inferences from the ode, in respect to
the individua] nominally addressed, is a mistake. C. iii. 24 bears a strong resemblance
to this ode, which must have been written aster Horace became possessed of his farm
(satis beatus unicis Sabinis), and that is all that can be said of the date.

. In wrifing the first few verses Horace may have had in mind some lines of Bacchy-
lida, inviting the Dioscuri to feast with him, preserved in Athenaeus (28 Bergk),
