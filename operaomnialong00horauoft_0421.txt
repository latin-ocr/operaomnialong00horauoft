Paene macros arsit dum turdos versat in igni3
Nam vaga per veterem dilapso flamma culinam
Volcano summum properabat lambere tectum.
Convivas avidos coenam servosque timentes
Tum rapere, atque omues restinguere velle videres.

Ostentare mihi, quos torret Atabulus et quos
Nunquam erepsemus nisi nos vicina Trivici

and still called Trevioe, a marquisate of

mau originss 'at which they were able to
put up for the night. He means the next

ney. Horace had been familiar with these
mountains in his early childhood, for they
overlooked his native town. ‘ Notos’ re-
fers ω these early reminiscences. ⁶ Trivi-

Antoninus, or the Jerusalem Itinerary.
It was probably on a cross read (Cramer,
ii. 259) which lay between the two
branches of the Appia Via, one of which
took the most direct course from Bene·
ventum through Venusia to Tarentum
and Brundusium, and the other took a
more northen-ly course across the Apen-
nines, near Equus Tuticus ; and then,
striking directly eastward till it arrived
very near the sea-coast, near Cannae, pro-
oeeded down the line of coast till it reached
Brundusium. Pratilli, supported by Bec-
ker (Gallus, Sc. iv. n.) denies that the
northern road was called Via Appia, which
name, he says, belongs only to the direct
road through Venusia. But even that he
thinks doubtful, since Strabo confines the
name to that part of the rond which lay
between Rome and Beneventum: τούν-
τεῦθεν δ’ ἤδη μέχρι τῆς Ῥώμης Ἀπία
καλ εἷται (vi. 283. Cas..) Cramer says,
‘⁴ the little town of 'frix-ico, which appears
on aheight above the course of the ancient
Appian way, points out the direction of
that road31md some ruins, which ure said
to be visible below it, probably represent
the farm which afforded a lodging to Ho-
race and his fellow- travellers, ·” in my
