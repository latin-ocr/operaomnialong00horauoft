'l'he circumstances under which this ode was written, and its probable date, ureris-en

· in the Introduction to C. 4 of this book, to which the render is referred. The common

inscriptions which made it an adds-em in honour of Augustus sufficieutly describe the

’ ’ spirit of it, though the professed purpose is to celebrate the part that Tiberius took with

Drusus in the victories over the German tribes.

ARGUM ENT.

With what honours shall we perpetuate thy virtues, Ο mightiest of princes, whose
strength the insolent Vindelici have felt Ρ With great slaughter Drusus cast them
down from their heights, and Tiberius drove them before him, as the south wind
driven the waves, or the swollen Aufidus lays waste the corn,—a scatheless victory;
and thoudidst lend thine armies thy counsels and thine auspioes. ’Twas fisteen years
fnum that day when Alexandria opened her gates to thee, that Fortune brought this
glory to thine arms. All nations bow down to thee, from the east to the west, from
the north to the south, O thou guardian of Italy and Rome!
