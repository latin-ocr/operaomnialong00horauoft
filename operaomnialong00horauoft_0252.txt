Princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos

Deduxisse modos.

Sume superbiam

Quaesitam meritis et mihi Delphica 15
Lauro cinge volens, Melpomene, comam.

nually’ ‘ usque’ only occurs in poeti-y,
and is always joined to a verb. What
follows means while the Pontifex Maximus
(⁶ Vestae sacerdos,' Ov. Fast. iii. 699)
shall, on the Ides of every mouth, go up
to the Capitol to offer sacrifice toVesta‚ her
virgins walking silently in the procession,
as they did, while the boys sang hymns in
honour of the goddess With a Roman
this was equivalent to saying for ever.

10. Dicar, qua violem· obstrepit Aufi-
dus] ‘ Violens' is not a common form of
‘ violentus? It occurs again Epp. i. 10.
37, and in Persius (Sat. v. 171), “nunc
ferus et violens.'’ The editors try to get
from these words a meaning Ι do not see
how they will bear, as if Horace meant to
say, as he says (C. iv. 9. 2), “ Longe so-

umntem natus ad Aufidum dicar-'⁹ The
words of Acron which Orelli quotes are
ambiguous, “Dicar princeps Aeolium car·
men ad Italos modos deduxisse, ubi Au-
fidus obstrepit,'’ which seems to mean,
not ‘ibi natus ubi‚' as Orelli sayS, but
‘ ad modos Italiae ubi‚' and that may be
Horace's meaning. But the order of the
words rather favours that Ι have given iu
the Argument. Horace says, in the for-
mer verseS‚ that he has wrought a work
for all time, and here he seemS‚ according
to the plain interpretation of the worda,
to take pleasure in the thought that he
shall be remembered in connexion with
his native place. But if this interpreta-
tion be objected to on the ground that
Horace never appeared to take any great
interest iu his birth-place (though the
references in C. iii. 4. 9 3 iv. 9. 2, and his
address to the fountain of Bandusia show
he had not forgotten it), either we must
suppose him to mean rtaly in general (for
which Daunia stands in C. iv. 6. 27), or
the words must be translated thus: ‘It
shall be said that I who in that place
where the Aufidus roars, and where Dau-
nus, poor in streams, ruled over his rustic
people, from a man of low degree became
great, was the first to adapt the Aeolian
verse to Italian measureS.' ‘ Obstrepere'

is used absolutely again Epod. ii. 27.
Apulia was not well watered.

12. Regnavit] This word, though it is
used in the passive voice (see last ode, v.

27), here only has a noun after it. Horace ,

gives it the genitive in imitation of ἄρχειν
[or βασιλεύειν] He wrote with his mind
full of Greek constructions and words-², aud
took the liberty of using them very freely.
Forcellini does not notice this passage,
and therefore it may be praeumed he only
knew of the reading ‘ regnator? Porphy-
rion (who says there was a river Daunus,
which there was not) writes expressly
“adnotanda elocutio per genitivum -
rata est.'’ All Lambinus' MSS„ several
of Bentley's and Cruquius' (but not the
Blandinians), and many others, including
two of Orelli's later Berne, and nearly all
the editions till Lambinus, had ‘regnatorff
But ‘ regnavit ’ is in the oldest Berne and
Blandinian, aud several more mentioned
by J ani ς a verb also is wanted, and ‘ reg-
navit ’ is not likely to have‚been invented
by the transcribers in so unusual a. oon-
struction. ‘Pauper' takes a genitive iu
S. i. 1. 793 ii. 3. 142.

- ex humi-li potens] Bentley and some
others (Sivry, Meineke) apply these words

to Daunus, because he was a private per- '

son, and from that condition became king
of Apulia. But this makes the words a
mere incumbi-auce without meaning.
Bentley never can believe that so humble
a man would boast so largely. Ι do not
know what the meaning of the ode is, if
a proud and legitimate sels-complacency
be not seen in every part of it. Horace
uses the expression ‘ potentium vatum'
in the eighth ode of the next book (v. 26),
[but not in the same sense as he uses
‘potens' here, which signifies his eleva-
tion in the world. Comp. Epp. i. 20. 20.]
Alcaeus and Sappho were his chief models
in lyric poetry, which he sums up in the
formula ‘ Aeolium carmen ’ here and in C.
iv. 3. 12. ‘ Delphica lauro' is the ‘laurea
Apollinari ¹ of C. iv. 2. 9.
