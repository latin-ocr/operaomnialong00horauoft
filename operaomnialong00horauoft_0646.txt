HORATII FLACCI

Quae mare compescant causae, quid temperet annum,
Stellae sponte sua jussaene vagentur et errent,

Quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat orbem,
Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors,

Empedocles an Stertinium deliret acumen.

trast between the necessary pursuits of his
daily life aud the high subjects his mind
rose to in spite of such drawbacks.

16. Quae mare compescant causae]
There is much poetical power in these four
verseS. They are worthy of Lucretius, and
in his style.

[17. sponte]

‘ Sunt in fortunae qui casibus omnia po-
nunt
Et nullo credunt mundum rectore moveri,
Nat-ura volvente vices et lucis et anni.’

Juv. Sat. xiii. 86.]

[18. Quid premat] ‘ Obscurum'expres-
’ scs the result of ‘premere,' which is op-
posed to ‘ proferre.’]

20. Empedocles an Stertinium] Em-
pedocles was born about ΒΩ. 520, and was
a man of wealth and station at Agrigentum
in Sicily. In respect to his pliysic5‚ which
are here more particularly referred to, he
seems to have held with the Eleatic School
of Xenophanes and Parmenides. What we

” know of his doctrines is chiefly derived from

fragments of two poenis in hexameter
verse, one called καθαρμοί, a song of expia-
tion(M1'iller’s Hist. Gr. Lit. p. 254); the
other on Nature, unless they are parts of
the same poem. His views are rendered
more difficult of comprehensioni by the pre-
tension, which runs through his works and
mystifies his style, to divine powers (A. P.
464). Lucretius (i. '732 sqq.) says of his
poems (of which, so far as the fragments
allow, an analysis is given by Ritter, Hist.
Phil. i. p. 445 sqq.) :—

“ Carmina quinetiam divini pectoris ejus
Vociferantur et exponunt praeclara re-
perta,

Ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.'’

They were much read and admired by the
Romans. Horace refers perhaps to a dogma
imputed to Empedocles (Diog. Laert. viii.
76): στοιχεῖα μὲν εἶναι τέτταρα, πῦρ, ὕδωρ,
γῆν, ἀέρα, φιλίαν τε ᾗ συγκρίνεται καὶ
νεῖκος ᾧ &cupiveram and to this Cicero

alludes (de Amic. c. 7) when he says*

¹lmow no other commentator who

“Agrigentinum quidem doctum quendam
virum carminibus Graecis vaticinatum fe-
runt, quae in rerum natura totoque mundo
constarent quaeque moverentur, ea con-
trahere amicitiam, dissipare discordiam?

Stertinius (Introduction to S. ii. 8) is
put again as the representative of the
Stoi οε, who in their physical theoryfollowed
Aristotle, and he appears to have had a
contempt for Empedocles ‘Stertinium'
is an adjective formed like ‘ Sulpiciis' in
C. iv. 12. 18. ‘ Stertinium acumen ’ is an
expression like ‘ sententia Catonis’ S. i. 2.
32 n.‚ and others quoted there, and ii. 1.
'7 2 n.), and ‘error Herculis’ in Propertius
(i. 20. 15) ε “ Quae miser ignotis mor per-
pessus in oris Herculis.” ‘ Deliret' is used
perhaps by way of joculan- allusion to the
Stoic theory noticed in S. ii. 8.

21. Verum-seu piet-ee] This is only t
ἔῑὲἴηοῖοὲἶίιῗέἰῖἓῗ 132⁹ ιιῗυῗὲῗ ῗῖιῗιῖῗνῗὲἶξ
was the chief purpose of the Epistle, the
introduction of Grosphus. Mamer-ing
lceks and onions is a humor-oua way of
alluding to the notion of Pythagoras (S. ii.
6. 63), and the same is extended to fishes
perhaps, because Empedocles, who believed
in the metempsychosis, though in a difler-
ent way from Pythagoras, and held that to
take life was against the universal law, de-
clared that he himself had once been a fieb,
among other things :—

ἥδη ’γάρ ποτ’ ἐγὼ ’γενόμην ιωῦρός τε κόρη
θάέιῗιέξ τ’ οἰωνός τε καὶ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἔμπυρος
ιχ υς.

We need not at any rate suppose that a
contrast of luxurions and fmgal fare is
meant in ‘pisces’ and ‘porrum et caepe!
“ Seu laute sive parce vivis '' is the expla-
nation of Comm. Cruq., which many com-
mental-,ors bave followed. [Ritter takes
these words liternlly ι part ofthe ‘ fructu&
of Agrippa were fish, leek and onion. 1-

with lum.] !
