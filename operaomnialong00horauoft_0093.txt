mesthi: theream two otherodes (iii. 15. iv. 13), the subject ofwhich isthe wan-
tonna· of fnded besuties, 8 subiect probably handled with still greater pungeuey by
Archilochus, for it was one his surenam would find scope in and wouldbe likely to fasten
upon. It is impossible to say whether Horace had any individusl in his mind when he
wrote my of theseodes. Ifhe had, we need not go further aud suppose that he wrote
ιι 8 ᾱίειρροίιιωᾱ lover. For instance, J ani’s indignation st the virulenoe with which
Horsoeonn find it in his heurt to uttack (C. iv. 13) the woman he was so fond of (C. iii. 9)
seems to be unneeessary. But it is a fair specimen of that matter-of-fiact school of in—
tes-petatium. 1 have before had oooesion to remark, how the same principle is applied
fo Lydis und how many new lights she appears in (C. 13. Introduction).

ARGUMENT.

Thy windows are no longer 1188311611 and thy elumbers broken by snuey youths3 thy
door turus no more on itshingeu theserenade is silent. Now 'tis thy turn, insome
lone alley on a dark night, with the winter wind blowing and thy heart on fire with
lust, to cry for lovers, and complain that young blood goes aster the tendet plant and
bida the old leaves go floet upon the Hebrus.

2. Idibus] The Blandinian MSS. and
the three oldest Berue and some others
give ‘jactibus’ which reading is probably
a gloss to explain the nature of the ‘ictus‚'
which meunt, it would seem, the throwing
of stenes. Lambinus likes that word [and
Keller and Ritter accept it]. Rutgersius
proposedfil ‘ tactibus: but it 1138 met with no

vour.

3. amat] So ‘littus ω’ (Aen v. 163),
‘ cluave to? ‘Multum' (11161118) 111 this
861186 18 common iu Horace, as ‘mul-
tum demissus homo,’ S. i. 3. 57; ‘ Multum

15

celer? S. ii. 3. 147. Such a serenade as
that which follows is C. iii. 10.

7. Me tuo] The possessive 111-01101111 is
used thus sbruptly once before (C. i. 15.
32), ‘¹ non hoc pollicitus tuae? and Ov.
Remed. Am. 492: “Frigidior glacie fac
videare tuae.”

[11. interlunia] ⁸ Est biduum quo luna
non visitur,' or the time of the conjunctioni
(coitus) of the 81111 and moon, 88 Pliny
names it.' Ritter.] ,

14. surim-e] This word we do not meet
with before Horace.
