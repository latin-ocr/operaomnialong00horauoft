EPISTLE X.

This Epistle is addressed to Fuscus Aristius, whose name appears in C. i. 22 ς S. i. 9.
61 3 10. 83. For such particulars as ean be stated about him see the Introduction to
the above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him to atown life. He was making
money in some way, and he was associated with all Horaee’s litem-y and other friends.
Horace prnises the freedom, the natural beauties, and the healthiness of the country,
und shows that they are natural to men’s tastes from the attempts'they make to get
trees in their town houses and a prospect over the fields. He follows this up with a

ARGUMENT.

You love the town, Fuscus3 I love the country: that is our only difference. Ι for my
part begin then to live and to be a king when I fly from all you praise so warmly.
1 am like the slave who ran away from his master the priest‚ because he got nothing
bnt sweet eake to eat. I want something wholesome. If we are ιο live naturally,
where can we build our house more fitly than in the country Ρ Where shall we find

⁴ such warmth in winter, such cool breezes in summer Ρ Where is sleep so unbroken
by care Ρ Is the meadow less bright and sweet than the marble floor Ρ Is the water
that struggles through the lenden pipe more pure than the rippling brook Ρ Why even
among your pillsrs you grow a sham forest, and you like no house like that which
has a landseape spread before it. Yon cannot get rid of Nature ι she will come back
and nmert her rights. “
