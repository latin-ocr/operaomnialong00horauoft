Phil. vol. iii. p. 563, Engl. Trans.). The
virtue of the Stoice was essentiallya Ro-
man virtue (O. S. 58 n.)‚ and lay in actiong
and with them the perfectiori of virtue was

18. Num in Adstippo'] Aster holding

for a time to the rigid school of virtue

ί and the Stoioe, he insensibly went over to

the hx doctrines of the Cyrenaies‚ whose
munder was Aristippus of Cyrene, one of
Socrates' least worthy disciploe. Η e held
man should control circum-
stances and not be controlled by them.
Hence he did not hesitate to expose him·
solt· to the greatest temptations, and when
he was blamed for keeping company with
lais, the courtesan, his reply was, ἔχω
Anna, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔχομαι (compare Diog.
Inert- ii. 66, 68, 75). An instance of his
indifference in another way is given above
(S. ii. 3. 100). Another story of the same
sort is given by Cicero (de Invent. ii. 58),
that he threw liis money into the sea.
But his object then was to save his life.
ln Epp. 17. 23 we have-

aequumss’

Plutarch says he was able ὥσπερ ἐπὶ ζύγου
πρὸς τὰ βελτίονα τῶν ὑποκειμένων ἐξ·
ανιιφέρειν καὶ ἂνακουφίζεσθιιι αὑτόν (De
Tranq. An. 8); and Diog. (ii. 66), ἣν δὲ
ἱκανὸς ἁρμόσασθαι καὶ τόπῳ καὶ χρόνῳ
καὶ sperare, καὶ πᾶσαν περίστασιν
ἂρμονίυς ὑποκρίνασθαι. Though there

was much affectation and at the same
time a want of practica] strictness in
these views, they in theory recognized
sels-control, or temperance and content-
ment, as the basis of happiness. But
while Aristippus inculcated sels-reliunoe
and eontentment, requiring an eure for
the future to be dismissed, and the
thoughts and desires to be confined to
the present moment, he brought in the
notion that present pleasure was the only
happiness, and this doctrine is associated
with the Cyrenaic school. Comm. Cruq.
explains “ Et mihi ΜΓ ke„ clearly, say-
ing, “Rebus utor its ut eis imperem non
autem ut eis serviam, ut avarus.” But
Aristippus departed from his own theory
when he departed from the rule of his
tencher and took money from his pupils
He was the first of the Socratics that did
to refer to
him, when he says that some of Soeratss’
disciples got for nothing a little of his
wisdom and sold it at a high price to
others (Mem. i. 2, ξ 60). Those that took
money from their disciples Socrates said
sold themselves into slavery, and he must
therefore have held this opinion of Aristip-
pns (lb. 56). His dialogue with Socrates
(Xen. Mem. ii. 1) throws light upon his

‘Lenta‚’ “qno scilicet Horatium ipsum
emendet,” as Baxter says. The change of
word weakens the force of the verse.

21. ut piyer annus pupillis] Every
boy who had lost his father was under
a ‘ tutor' or guardian in respect of his
property, while the care of his person be-
longed to his mother, or, in the case of
her death, to his nearest relation, provided
he was not a ‘ pupillns' himself. This
lasted till the age of puberty (fourteen).
The boy was a ⁶ pupillus,’ not in relation
to his mother, but to his tutor, who might
be appointed by the mother if she had by
the father‘s will ‘ tutoris optionem‚’ and if
that ‘ optio ' was ‘ plena ' she might change
the tutor as osten as she pleased3 isit was
