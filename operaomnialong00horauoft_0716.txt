680 HORATII FLACCI

some more lyrics, ‘ carmina ' (vv. 25, 59), for which he had no mind. Whether he had
already published the fourth book of Odes is not certain, for there are no sure means
of determiniug the date of the Epistle. But there is no appearance of its having been
written about the same time with the other Epistle. As Kirchner says, there' is no
reason to suppose Horace would have kept a poem of so much merit locked up in his
desk while he was putting forth the first book. Besides which Horace wrote to Florus
on that journey, whereas here he supposes him to complain of his not having written
either letter or verses. 1 am not sure that the first verse does not betray 8 later date,
though it has led many into dating the two Epistles at the same time. Florus was
evidently a young man. when he went with Tiberius into Armenia, A.U.c. '7 34. He might
even at that time have been called his ‘fidelis amicus ;’ but the words seem to imply
a longer and more matured friendship; and the epithet ‘ clarus‚' which would have been
mere flattery when Tiberius was twenty-two and had done nothing, would suit him very
well after his successes against the Raeti celebrated in C. iv. 14. [In A.U.c. ¹742,
Tiberius was sent by Augustus against the Pannonians (Dion Cass. 54. 31); and in
A.U.c. 743 he was again engaged with the Dalmatians and the Pannonians (Dion Cass.
54. 34). In B.c. 744 Tiberius was sent from Gallia against the Dalmatians once more
(Dion Cass. 54. 36). In A.U.c. 745 he brought home the remains of his brother Drusus
from Gerlnauy (Dion Cass. 55. 2). Florus may have accompanied Tiberius either in
742, 743, or 744] Tiberius also went with Augustus to Gaul ,ΔΜ-Ο. ’738 (Dion Cass.‘
54. c. 19), and Florus may have been with him then. The objection to that earlier
date is that Horace did certainly write verses about that time, of the kind Florus asked
for ; and though this is not conclusive, for 118 wrote with no great love for the task, on
ι the whole Ι think a later date is more probable *.

Though there does⁸ not profess to be much substance in the Epistle, Ι think it the
most agreeable of all. The stories in illustration are very well told 3 the description
of the town and its annoyances has the force without the harshness of Juvenal 3 the
vanity of authors is ridiculed in 8 happy and humorous way, and the advice given
them is good3 and though as usual the sermon at the end about money and philosophy
is perhaps a little tedious, and not very convinciug, as a whole the Epistle is written
in a popular style, and the lang-uage and versification are easy and correct. It is
always pleasant likewise to hear Horace speaking of himself, the events of his life, and
the peculiarities of his character. This Epistle furnishes materials for a considerable
part of his biography‚ and makes us acquainted with his poetica] career in particular.
It represents him as writing more from necessity than out of love to poetry, and it
would not be difficult to trace the force of a pressure from without in many parts of
his works.

ARGUMENT.

(v. 1.) Florus, if any one were to offer you a slave for sale, and say, ‘Here is a hand-
some accomplished boy, you shall have him cheap: I have no wish to puff my
property, and am not obliged to part with him ; but you will find him, 1 assure you,
a bargain: no dealer would give him you for the money, and there is no one but
yourself I would give him to so cheap: but I must tell you he once shirked duty (as
boys will), and hid himself in the staircase‚’—if you bought the boy you would do so
with your eyes open and at your own risk. You could not bring an action against
the man if your slave ran away again.

(v. 20.) When you were going away 1 told you 1 was too lazy to answer your letters
