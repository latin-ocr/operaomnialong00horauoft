HORATII FLACCI

Aemula, sed tenuis simplexque foramine pauco
Adspirare et adesse choris erat utilis atque

Nondum spissa nimis complere sedilia flatu ;

205

Quo sane populus numerabilis utpote parvus
Et frugi castusque verecundusque coibat.
Postquam coepit agros extendere victor et urbes
Latior amplecti murus vinoque diurno

Placari Genius festis impune diebus,

210

Accessit numerisque modisque licentia major ;
Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum
Rusticus urbano confusus, turpis honesto?

Sic priscae motumque et luxuriem addidit arti
Tibicen traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem;

215

Sic etiam fidibus voces crevere severis,

which is the reading of the oldest edi-
tions and some MSS. The best have
‘ vincta? Horace says that in simplet days
the ‘ tibia' served for an accompaniment to
the chorus, but afterwards it came to drown
> it. In those days the population of the

city was smaller, the theatres less crowded,
and the audience more reverential and at-
tentive. What times Horace alludes to it is
difficult to say. Orelli thinks his history
of choral music is a fanciful account, fluc-
tuating wonderfully between the practice
of the Greeks, that of the Romans, and that
which his own imagination has drawn;
and this is perhaps the ease.

[205. complere] ‘ Utilis eomplere,' ‘ suf-
ficient to fi11.’]

208. Postquam coepit ayros] That is,
“post Punica bella ” (Epp. ii. 1. 162 n.)

. if we take the Romans, and the Persian

war if we suppose the Greeks to be meant.
(See v. 93 of the same Epistle.) As to
‘placari Genius’ see Epp. ii. 1. 144, and
i. 7. 94 11. Ven. 1483, and I believe all the
editions of that century, and Ascensius
(1519), and nearly all the MSS„ have
‘ urbes,' which, as Horace is not referring
to any one city, is the right reading.
Bentley follows the Aldine and other edi-
tions of the sixteenth century, Lambinus,
Cruquius, and Torrentius, in reading ‘ ur-
bem?

211. numerisque modisque] This com-
bination occurs above, Epp. ii. 2. 144.
‘Liber laborum ’ is a poetical construction
like ‘operum solutis' (C. iii. 17. 16) and
‘ operum vacuo ⁹ (S. ii. 2. 119).

[212. liberque laborum] ‘ Rcleased from
their toils' and ready for eujoyment.]

215. traxitque vayus per pulpita vestem]

[The ‘ tibicen' finally appeared on the
stage in a long flowing robe to play as the
actore recited.] The Roman dress was
probably not so splendid as the Greek, of
which Miiller observes that “it was a Bac-
chic festal costuma. Almost 1111 the actors
in a tragedy wore long striped garments
(χιτῶνες ποδήρεις, στολαί) reaching to the
ground, over which were thr-own upper
garments of purple or some other brilliant
colom, with all sorts of gay trimmings and
gold ornaments (ἱμάτια and χλαμύδες. Epp.
i. 6. 40 11.). Even Hercules appeared in
this rich and gaudy dress, to which his
distinctive attributes, the club and the
bow, were merely added (see below, v. 228).

The choruses also vied with each other' m
the splendour of their dress and ornaments,

as well as in the excellence of their singing
and dancing'' (Gr. Lit. c. 22). Asto‘ pnl-

pita’ see Epp.ii.1. 174.

216. Sic etiam fidibus· voces crevere
severis] I am not sufficiently acquainted
with music to explain the scales of the
tetrachord or the improvements made by
Terpander. (See above, v. 83 n.) But
the reader who understands the subject
may consult Mffller’s chapter on Greek
Music, in his History of Greek Literature,
c. xii. The sedate and serious Doric style
would be expressed by ‘ fidibus severis ς’ but
Horace is speaking generally, and probably
from his own imagination, when he says
that in the course of time the grave style
of music to which the choi-uses were once
:3¹255333„23:21233‘3112‘533‘323. ἶζιῗέ
impetuous, and it began to speak in
language obscure, prophetie, and ora-
culm,
