CARMEN XII.
Before A.U.c. 735.

The commenta‘mrs are much divided in their opinions as to the person to whom this
ode is addressed. The old inscriptions vary, but in such a manner as to show that none
of them have any weight or authority. Torrentius mentions three MSS. which are
headed “Ad Virgilium Unguentarium urbis discriptio (the common blunder for ‘de-
scriptio') Pamenetice,” and he himself adopts this absurdity, derived from v. 17. The
Scholiast Acron says, “Ad Virgilium negociatorem scribit‚’' which is a mere assumption
from the opening lines and v. 25, and when he interprets “juvenum nobilium” (v. 15)
as Augustus, or Maecenas, or the step-sons of Augustus, he shows he knew nothing of
what he was writing about. If the question were to be decided by number8‚ it would
on the whole be given in favour of Virgil the poet, and the presumption is εο much in
favour of that notion that the proof of the contrary lies Ι think with those who deny
it. Gesner says there is nothing in the ode to indicate so warm a friendship as sub-
sisted between Horace and the poet Virgil. But the ode is at best a. trifle, and an in-
vitation to dinner is not the most inspiring subject. When Vix-gil was going to sea,
perhaps for his health, Horace's feeling for him was shown strongly enough, which
would bc natural. Orelli and others object to the expression “juvenum nobilium
cliens,’' as applied to Virgilius Maro. But if the Scholiasts are agreed that ‘juvenum'
may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they at least concede the point that ‘cliens’
may mean virgil the poet. Augustus is represented as a ‘ juvenis’ in the second
ode of the first book, v. 41 n. The difficulty that arises out of v. 25, ‘ pone—studium
lucri‚’ Orelli himself disposes of, in his note on that verse, when he says that it is
evidently a joke ; for, though he also says in the Introduction that such a joke, if it be
a joke, levelled at such a man would be very fiat, this can hardly be determined till we
know the point of it. We need not assume with Stephens (Diatr. iv. p. '7 6) that
Horace means by ‘ studium lucri,’ ‘ mercaturam bonarum artium’ (Cio. de Off. iii. 2), or
the expectation of payment for his verses· If there be a joke,Virgil understood it,
whoever virgil was; but be he who he may we do not understand it, so that nothing is
gained by this argument. I have not seen all that has been said upon the subject,
which has been discussed in separate treatises and in all commentaries, and which must
always remain matter of opinion founded upon very slender datm but my own judg-
ment is in favour of supposing the ode to be an early one addressed to P. Virgilius Maro,
the poet, not to “ some relation or client of his,'' nor to “the grandson of C. Vergilius,
the praetor and friend of Cicer0,'’ . nor to a. “ physician of the Nerones,” nor ‘oo a ’
trader, nor to a perfumer. The pastoral images and description in the three first
stauzas have always appeared to me particularly suited ‘m an ode addi-cssed to Vix-gil the
author of the Bucohcs, and 1 obscrvc Docring makes that remark. 'l'aking the two
