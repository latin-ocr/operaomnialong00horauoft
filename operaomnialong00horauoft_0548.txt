HORATII FLACCI

Ad caelum manibus sublatis dixerit, urge,
Crescentem tumidis infla sermonibus utrem.
Cum te servitio longo curaque levarit,

Et certum vigilans, QUARTAE SIT PARTIS ULIXEs,

Nusquam est?

Gaudia prodentem voltum celare.

Audieris, HERES: Ergo nunc Dama sodalis
Unde mihi tam fortem tamque fidelem?
Sparge subinde3 et, si paulum potes, illacrimare: est

with your fulsome breath like a bladder.
Though the old man might say he had
enough, he was not to be taken at his word,
but plied still harder, for he never could
have too much. If the man's tact were
proportioned to his servility, this advice
might be of use to him ; otherwise it would
only do in very gross cases. ‘ Importunus '
Lambinus explains as “ is qui nunquam
’ conquiescit neque aliis conquiescendi potes-
tatem facit.'' The expression ‘Ohe jam
satis’ is common. See S. i. 5. 12, and
Martial (iv. 91) z

“ Ohe jam satis est, ohe libelle,
J am pervenimus usque ad umbilicum.”

100. Et certum vigilans] Bentley illus-
trates this by Ovid (Heroid. x. 9) :

‘¹ Incertum vigilans, a somno languida, movi
Thesea pressuras semisupina manus ;”

It means therefore ‘ wide awake,' not con-
fusedly as those who are half asleep.

— Quartae sit partis] The ‘heres'of one
fourth of the property would be ‘ ex quad-
rante’ or ‘ ex teruncio.’ (See note on v. 53,
above.) The formula in wills was such as
this: “Sola mihi uxor heres esto‚” “Sem-
pronius ex parte dimidia heres esto ;'’
wherefore Bentley, with a very little au-
thority, substitutes ‘ esto’ for ‘ sit?

101. Dama] See v. 18. He is to
throw in now and then (‘ sparge subinde ’)
a whine for the dear man that is gone,
and squeeze out a tear if he possibly can.

102. Unde mihi tamfortem] This abrupt
and elliptical way of speaking occurs again
below (S. 7. 116): “Unde mihi lapidem Ρ
Quorsum est opus ‘r’ Unde sagittas ?’'
Seneca (Herc. Fur. 296) has the same:

unde illum mihi

Q¹¹⁰dfi⁸ Ptriamque dexteram amplectar
iem

 

Compare the broken lang-uage Parmeno
puts in Phaedria’s mouth in Terenc‘e (Eun.
i. 1. 20) ε “ Egone illam Ρ quae illum ?’'
quae me? quae non?’' dvc. ‘Parabo'
may be understood, or some such word.

[103. illacrimare] Kriiger has adopted
Lachmann's emendation (Lucretius, v.
533, p. 297), ‘illacrima: e re est? Ac-
cording to the pointing of the text, this
passage is evidence of a form ‘ illacrimor ς’
but Doederlein suggests that ‘ illaerimare’
is the infinitive, and that so there should be
a comma after ‘ illacrimare? ‘and if you
can drop a tear, you may hide a counte·
nance which betrays joy ;’ or, as he says,
we may translate, ‘ and if you can shed a
tear—,³ and leave the reader to supply
what is wanting. Any thing is better
than Lachmann's monstrous emendation.]

— est] This is equivalent to ἔξεστι.
Lambinus quotes this verse from Publius
Syrus: “Heredis fletus sub persona risus
est.”

105. Permissum. arbitrio] A sum of
money was generally named in the will
for the funeral expensas. Sometimes they
appear to have been left expressly to the
judgment and liberality of the ‘ herae’ or
‘ heredes' as here. But if no mention was
made of this subject in the will, or if a.
man died intestata, those who succeeded to
the property were bound to provide all that
was decent for his intermeat. As to ‘ fimus?
see note on S. i. 6. 43. ‘Commissum’
was the common reading before Lambinus
(though Venn. 1483 has ‘ permissum'); but
‘ permissum ' has more authority, and Lam-
binus says truly “ committere fidei dicimus,
poteris permittere potestati et arbitrio.”
See C. i. 9. 9: “ permitte divis caetera.''

108. seu fundi sive domu-s· sit emptor]
‘ Fundus' is an estate with the buildings
on it. ‘ Domus,’ which is opposed to
