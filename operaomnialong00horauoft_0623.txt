Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis
Adducit febroe et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi brumanives Albanis illinet agris,

10

Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget; te, dulcis amice, reviset
Cum Zephyris, si concedes, et hirundine prima.
Non quo more piris vesci Calaber jubet hospes

'ru me fecisti locupletem.

ΧΠ. Tables, says, “Reliqua in more sunt 3
funus ut indicatur, si quid ludorum; do-
·111111 funeris utatur accenso aut 110-
toribus? The ‘dominus funeris ' here was
the ‘ designator,’ which name belonged
also to the person who put people of rank
111 their places at the theatre. Plautus

(Ροωιιι. Prot. 18) :-

“ Neu lictor verbnm ant virgae muttiant ;
Neu designator praeter os obambulet ;

'nie sturm ‘dissignator’ occurs in inscrip÷
timu und some MSS„ including nearly all
„tho Parisino. [Ritter has ‘dissignator.’]

As to the verb ‘designare’ see Epp. 5.
16 n.

8- Offieiosaque sedulitas] That is at-
tending upon great people, and so forth.
It does not seem as if the diminutive form
¹ opella· had any particular force. Horace
11888 diminutives when it suits the mea-
sure. [See Epp. i. 17. 21, ‘ officium facio?
·‘ Besignatl ‘unseals.’ In v. 34, pesigno'
means ‘ I give up.']

isnsed with reference to a' future event,
even if it be not hypothetical, when any
aeti3n depends upon that event, as (S. ii.

“ — multa et praeclara minantis
Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto,”

and elsewhere3 so that it becomes nearly
eqnivalent to ‘ cum.’ As soon as the snow
shall lie ou the Alban hills he will

at his own place or at home. ¹ Con-
tractus' expresses the attitude of a man
sitting head and knces together, wrapped
up by the 11118 10 keep himself warm.
[This interpretation is not universally

accepted. Krfiger suggests that ‘ con-
tractus ’ means ¹ in my retirement-⁹] The
west wind set in about the second week in
February. [Ritter concludes from v. 10
that Horace wrote this epistle in a villa
near to the Alban hills, and at Praeneste,
as he assumes, because on one occasion he
was there (Epp. i. 1. 2). He also assumes
that the epistle to Lollius and this epistle
were written in the same year, ΔΑΜ). 733.
Τ118 render will easily see that Ritter’s
conclusions are not certain]

14. calaber jubet hospes] The man is
made a Calabrian only to give the 8
more point, not 1 think 88 Orelli says be-
cause the Calabrians were

‚ta · . „ “ politioris

The question is not one
of refined manners-2, but of genuine or
false hospitality3 and the former does not
belong exclusively to conventional reflue-
ment, which 18 rather apt to corrupt it.
The guest is polite enough, and he is a
Calabrian 100.

16. Benigne] This is a polite way of
declining the offer. “ Yon are very good,''
the refusal being expressed in action (see
v. 62). It might mean acceptance, just
as the Freuch say ‘merci‚' meaning ‘ yes '
or ‘no,’ according to circumstances. In
Shakspeare's Meri-y Wivoe of Windsor
(Act i. Sc. 1), Anne Page says to Slender,
“ Will ’t plcase your worship to come in,
Sir?” And he answers, bashfully, “1
thank you forsooth, heartily; I am very
mnf—Anne. “ I may not go in without
your worship: they will not sit till you
come.”- Slender, “ 1² saith 1¹11 eat no·

did '' (“ Tam teneor dono, quam si di·

between 1118 maid servant and Xanthias
111 Aristophanes (Rau. 503 sqq.)‚ when, to
her eat-nest invitation to come in and eat

of her 1181111188, 118 answers sheepishly,
