156 . HORATH FLACCI

Damnum : neque amissos colores
Lana refert medicata fuco,
Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit
Curat reponi deterioribus. 30

Qui lora restrictis lacertis 35
Sensit iners timuitque mortem.
Hic unde vitam sumeret inscius
Pacem duello miscuit. O pudor!
O mag-na Karthago, probrosis
Altior Italiae ruinis! . 40
Fertur pudicae conjugis osculum
Parvosque natos ut capitis minor
