584 HORATII FLACCI

Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulixei,

Cui potior patria fuit interdicta voluptas.

Si, Mimnermus uti censet, sine amore jocisque 65 ·
Nil est jucundum, vivas in amore jocisque.

Vive, vale.

Si quid novisti rectius istis

Candidus imperti; si non, hjs utere mecum.

fuit? Acron says “Caerites populi sunt
quos cum vicissent Romani, statuerunt ut
nunquam leges ederent nec leges haberent,
quod multum ignominiosum fuit.'' Comm.
Cruq. says they had the full ‘ civitas ’
given them after the Gallie invasion, but
after they had forfeited it, the Romans re-
stored it without the ‘jus suffragii,' which
however would be no great loss if they had
the ‘ commercium' and ‘ connubium.'
‘ Caeritum cerae‚’ or ‘tabulae‚’ would mean
properly a register of the inhabitants of
Caere, who would of course be registered

. when they came into the above relation to

Rome. But it seems probable that at this
time the name had a conventional mean-
ing, and applied to the registers of all
those who were in the position of ‘ aerarii‚’
that is, of the citizens of such towns as
had not the perfect franchise, and of those
citizens who had for any cause been de-
graded from their tribes (see Niebuhr,
Rom. Hist. ii. 67 3 iii. 85). “Tabulae
Caerites appellatae in quas censores referri
jubebant quos notae causa suffragiis priva·
bant ’' (Gell. ubi sup.). Asconius (in Cic.
Divinat. p. 103, ed. Orelli, where there are
a few variations from the text of Asconius
as it is printed here) has the following
note 2——“ Regendis moribus civitatis een-
sores quinto quoque anno creari solebant.
Hi prorsus cives sic notabant : ut qui
senator esset ejiceretur senatu; qui eques
Romanus equum publicum perderet; qui
plebeius in Caeritum tabulas referretur,
et aerarius fieret, ac per hoc non esset in
albo centuriae suae, sed ad hoc esset civis
tantum, ut pro capite suo tributi nomine
aera penderet.” Thus Horace means that
they who took such a low view of life were
not worthy of being Roman citizens, being
more on an equality with the crew of Ulys-
ses, whom Circe turned to swine (Epp, 2.
23, n.)‚ and who slew and eat the kine
sacred to the Sun, though they swore they
would not, and their return home de-
pended on their oath being kept. Odyss.
xi. 105, sqq.; xii. 303, sq.; 340, sqq. ‘Re-
migium ' is used for the rowers, as ‘man-
cipium,' ‘servitium,’ are used for a slave,
and many other words are used in the
same way.

25. Sa· Mimnermus uti censet] We may

assume that Horace was familiar with the
writings of Mimnermus, the elegiae poet
of Smyrna. He preferred him to Calli-
machus, as appears from Epp. ii. 2. 99, sqq.
His poetry is of a melancholy cast, as far
as we can judge from the few frag-ments
that have coine down to ns: though love
was their principal theme and the only
remedy he recognizes for the ills of life, it
does not seem as if he was very happy in
his experience of it. One fragment, pre-
served in Stobaeus (Florileg. 63. 16, Fr. 1,
Bergk), bears out what Horace sayS. He
may have had many such passages in his
mind. It begins,—

τίς δὲ βίος, τί δὲ τερπνὸν ἄτερ χρυσέης
Ἀφροδίτης;
τεθναίην ὅτε μοι μηκέτι ταῦτα μέλοι,
κ.τ.λ.

Horace adds ‘jocisque,’ as elsewhere he
makes Jocus the companion of Venus (C.

i(3 25} 3141)) Propertius says of Mimnermus
l· . ,—

“Plus in amore valet Mimnermi versus
Homer03
Carmina, mansuetus lenia quaerit
amor.

Porphyrion's note appears to be derived
from some information he pom and
we do not, auditis worth adding: ‘⁶ Mim-
nermus elegans scriptor fuit, qui in qua-
dam ecloga Hieronymi sectam commen-
dans summum bonum indolentiam ait,
quam Graeci ἀναλγησίαν nominant: mo-
lestias amores plus quam gaudii habere
demonstrat? 'l'he last sentence, if the
,text is correct, contradicts Horace, and is
not therefore to be trusted. It is also
against all we have of Mimnermus’
writings.

68. his utere mecum] There is no diffi-
culty in understanding that ‘his’ refers
to the rule laid down at the beginning
and taken up in v. 30 :—

“ Si virtus hoc una potest dare fortis
onnssxs
Hoc age deliciis ;''
for all that follows is only recommended
ironically, and in such a way as to hold
up to contempt every rule of life but that
of virtue.
