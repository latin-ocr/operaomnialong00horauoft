and in Epp. i. 4. 15 :—

“ Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute
Cussselsizdere voles Epicuri de grege por·
cum. ’

‘ Corpus curare ' is a common phrase, and
Horace has “genium curare '' (C. 111. 17.
153οᾷ cognitor ,- ipse] ‘Si,' ‘sis,' ‘fis‚’
appear in the old editions and in some

. MSS. Lambinus restored the word ‘fi‚’

which is found in the best MSS. and 111
‘two of the oldest editions, that of Milan,
1476, and the Venetian, 1479. ‘ Cognitor'
is one who is authorized 10 appear for
another, either in maintaining or defend-
ing an action. ‘ Procurator’ was also one
who acted for another ,- but there was this
difference between the two, that the pro-
curator had to give security that the plain-
tiff would adopt his acts, which the plain·
tiff was not bound to do, because the pro-
curator was 1101 necessarily appointed by
the plaintiff; while the cognitor had no
security to give, because he was appointed
by and looked upon as the principal, and
he was liable as such (Gaius iv. 97). The
obsequiousness of the will-hunter was not
to be deterred by such a responsibility.
The editors generally take ‘ipse' with
⁶ cognitor,’ in which case it must mean
that he was of his own accord (‘ ipse ') to
offer himself to the man as his cognitor,
and see that he got his rights without
any trouble or anxiety. This meaning of
‘ipse ‘ is not uncommon. The Greeks used
αὐτός in the same way. But it seems
more simple to take ‘ipse‚' as Heindorf
does, with what follows: “become his
cognitor, and let him go home, while you
yourself persevere, and hold out sor him,
whatever the weather may be.'’

39. seu rubra Canicula] He means in
the height of summer or the depth of win-
ter. The 4lst verse, with the substitution
of Furius for J uppiter‚ is taken from Biba-

culus (Exc. on S. i. 10. 36). The epit-het
‘rubra' for the dog-star, and ‘infantes’
as an ornamental epithet to express the
speechlessness of the statues (Epp. ii. 2.
83) are sufficiently absurd,*and the hyper-
bole is not in good taste ; there is vulgarity
likewise in ‘conspuet.’ ‘Omaso’ Porcel-
lini interprete ‘pro ipso ventre.' It does
not occur elsewhere in this sense. It
usually signifies tripe, a vulgar dish even
ampng the Romans. (See Epp. i. 15.

42. cubito stantem prope tangens]
Persius has the same expression: “Est
prope te ignotus cubito qui tangat ” (S.
iv. 34 .

[43) amieis aptus] ‘A useful friend:
Doederlein ; that is, ‘ a useful man to his
friends? He compares cicero ad Fam.
xii. 30, ‘ Ο 1101010010 semper illum quidem
mihi aptum.’]

44. Plures adnabunt thurini] The tunny
fish is found in large shoals at particular
seasons in the Mediterraneum, into which
it comes from the Atlantic to deposit its
spawn, and passes through to the Black
Sea. Vast quantities were and still are
caught and salted. ‘Cetaria' were arti-
ficial preserves 11110 which the fish were
attracted and then taken. Salting-
houses were built hard by. ‘'l'lmnni’
here is put for the rich fools who would
be caught by the servility of the fortune-
hunter.

46. sublatas] This sense of ‘tollere’ to
educate, bring up, is said to be taken from
the practice of fathers taking up in their
arms immediately aster their birth such of
their children as they wished to be real-ed,
while the others they lest to be exposed.
