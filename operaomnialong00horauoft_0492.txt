HORA'I'II FLACCI

Membra dedit, 'vegetus praescripta ad munia surgit.
Hic tamen ad melius poterit transcurrere quondam,

Sive diem festum rediens advexerit annus,

Seu recreare volet tenuatum corpus, ubique

Accedent anni et tractari mollius aetas 85
Imbecilla volet : tibi quidnam accedet ad istam

Quam puer et validus praesumis mollitiem, seu

Dura valetudo inciderit seu tarda senectus ’.Ρ

Rancidum aprum antiqui laudabant, non quia nasus

Illis nullus erat sed credo hac mente, quod hospes 90
Tardius adveniens vitiatum commodius quam

Integrum edax dominus consumeret.

Hos utinam inter

Heroas natum tellus me prima tulisset!

Das aliquid famae quae carmine gratior aurem

Occupat humanam : grandes rhombi patinaeque 95
Grande ferunt una cum damno dedecus ; adde

Iratum patruum, vicinos, te tibi iniquum,

Et frustra mortis cupidum, cum deerit egenti

As laquei pretium.

“ Jure,”

inquit, “ Trausius istis

J urgatur verbis ,- ego vectigalia magna 100
Divitiasque habeo tribus amplas regibus.'' Ergo
Quod superat non est melius quo insumere possis?

trasted with the luxurious protracted
μ dinner. In v. 85 Ritter, following the best
MSS„ omits‘ et' and takes‘ ubique’ in the
sense of‘ atque ubi. ']

82. quondam] See C. ii. 10. 1¹7 ιι.
87. mollitiem] ‘Indulgence‚’
as applied to youth, must be understood in
a bad sense; but to age or sickness in a
good, as that which infirmity or disease

requires.

89. Ramidum aprum] Their hospitable
forefathers‚ rather than eat their boar
while it was fresh by themselves, would
keep it till it was high, in case a sti-anger
should drop in to eat of it with them.
Horace was a. ‘laudator temporis acti,’
and iu respect at least to simplicity of
social and domestic habits there is no
doubt he was right. How far he was
sincere in the wish that bursts forth in
v. 93 is perhaps doubtful. He himself
suggests the doubt (S. 7. 23), and he pro-
bably knew his own mind.

93. tellus· me prima] See S. i. 3. 99.

94. Das aliquid famae] ι-Ι suppose
you have some consideration for your
character?

95. patinaeque] The ‘patina’ was a

which,

covered dish in which meats were brought
in hot from the kitehen. ‘ Patruus ' was as
proverbial a name for tyranny on the male
side of the family as ‘ noverca’ on the
female. See C. iii. 12. 3, and Cicero pro
Cael. 11: “Fuit in hac eausa pertristis
quidam patruus, censor, magister? S. ii.

99. As laquei pretiwm] This was a
proverb, or became so. See Lucian (Tim.
c. 20). ἐγ ὼ δὲ καὶ πολλοὺς ἃν εἰπεῖν
ἔχοιμί σοι χθὲς μὲν οὐδὲ ὄβολον ὥστε πρ ία-
σθαι βρόχον ἐσχηκότας, ἄφνω δὲ τήμερον
πλουσίους καὶ πολυτελεῖς. The old reading
‘aesss as Orelli observes, destroys the
proverb. We may infer that Transius
lived profusely upon small means and
ruined himself, which the speaker con-
siders himself too rich ever to do. ‘Vec-
tigalia’ is a private fortune-⁸ in C. iii. 16.
40. Its use is appropriate here in con-
nexion with‘ regibus& ‘rich men.’

[102. quod superat-³] ‘Is there then
nothing better on which you could spend
your superfluous wealth’ (quod superat) i'

‘Quo’ is equivalent to‘ in quod‚’ as‘ eo’
sometimes is equivalent to‘ in' with an
accusative. ]
