588 HORATII FLACCI

⁴ “ Non invisa feres pueris munuscula parvis.”
“ Tam teneor dono quam si dimittar onustus.”
“ Ut libet3 haec porcis hodie comedenda relinques.’'
Prodigus et stultus donat quae spernit et odit ,· 20
Haec seges ingratos tulit et feret omnibus annis.
Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus,
Nec tamen ignorat quid distent aera lupinis :
Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.
Quodsi me noles usquam discedere, reddes 25
Forte latus, nigros angusta fronte capillos,
Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere decorum et
Inter vina fugam Cina-rae maerere protervae.
Forte per angustam tenuis vulpecula rimam
Repserat in cumeram frumenti, pastaque rursus 30
Ire foras pleno tendebat corpore frustra ;
Cui mustela procul, “ Si vis,’' ait, “ effugere istinc,

κάλλιστ’, ἐπαινῶ-πάνυ καλῶς. (See Cicero
in Verr. ii. 3. 85, Long's note.)

22. dignis ait esse paratus] Several
examples of this sort of attraction are
given in Key's L. G. 1060. Orelli 1188
collected more on this place. See also
C. iii. 16. 32 8., and C. iii. 27. 73, “ Uxor
invicti Jovis esse nescis.'’ ‘ Dignis' is
masculine: the wise man is ready to
serve those who are worthy, Ε.3 he ’18 no
simpleton3 he knows the uifference be-
tween true money and countsszff'eit. [He
knows the value of what he gives, as well
88 118 knows the difference between money
and lupines.] Lupines were used for
counters or 8118111 money on the stage ς
“ comicum aurum '³ as it is called in Plau-
tus (Poen. iii. 2. 20).

24. Dignum praestabo me] Horace says
he will endeavour to show himself worthy
(referring to ‘dignis’ above) in propor-
tion to the excellence of him (Maecenas)
who has laid him under such obligations.
[‘Merentis’ is equivalent to ‘bene me-
rentis,' one who has done a service to
another and deserves a return. Krfiger
compares Vir-gil, Aen. vi. 664: “Quique
sui memores alios fecere inerendo.’'] He
says in effect that Maecenas does not
bestow his liberality stupidly, as one who
gave 1118 friends what he was just as ready
to throw to the pigs, or the fool who does
not know the value of his gifts. He only
gaveidtto til? wortllijy, arlifd such Horace
wou rove lmse .

26. aliga-stell) fronte] See C. i. 33. 5 n.

27. Reddes dulce loqui] A similar in-

stance, illustrating the nature of the in-
finitive as a neuter substantive, occurs
above (S. ii. 7. 43), “Aufer Me vultu
terrere.” See Key’s L. G. 12322—“111
the Greek language this is so completely
the case that the article may be prefixed
to it in all its cases. The English also
treat their infinitivo as 8 substantive
when they place before it the preposition
ς ἴθ’, >5

28. Cinarae] See C. iv. 1. 4 n.

29. vulpecula] Bentley has a facetious
note, in which he appeals to huntsmen,

countrymen, and natural philosophers, ·

against such a monstrous notion as a fox
eating corn. He proves that they have
neither teeth to grind nor 8 stomach to
digest it. But the reader must go to his
note, “quam legisse non poenitebit‚” says
Forcellini, Ι hardly know why. It repre-
sents to me nothing but the arrogance of

the author. He proposes, out of his own “

head, ‘ nitedula‚’ a ‘ field—mouse,’ without
attempting to explain how this word 1188
disappeared from every MS„ and 1188 been
met with in no edition till his own. 'rho
improbability of an illustration is no
reason for abandoning or altering it. We
are all familiar with the proverb of the
camel and the needle's eye, and the fables
of Aesop abound in improbabilities. The
cunning of the fox brings him frequently
into stories of this sort: in this instance
hc overreaches himself. ‘Cumemss S. i.
