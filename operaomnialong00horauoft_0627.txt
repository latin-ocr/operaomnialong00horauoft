Praeconem, tenni censu, sine crimine, notum
Et properare loco et cessare et quaerere et uti,
Gaudentem parvisque sodalibus et lare certo
Et ludis et post decisa negotia Campo.

“ Scituri libet ex ipso quodcunque refers ; dic
Non saue credere Mena,
Quid multa ⁸? “ Benigne,”
ξ( Neget ille mihi ?” “ Negat improbus et te
Volteium mane Philippus
Vilia vendentem tunicato scr a popello

‘Ad coenam veniat?
Mirari secum tacitus.

’ Respondet.
Negligit aut horret.”

Moundou-us (Epod. iv. Int.), as Demas to
Demetrius, Lucas to Lucanus, Silas to
Silvanus, Artemas to Artemius, dcc. [Rit-
ter affin-ms, aud Kriiger, but not so posi-
tively, that the slave gets his information,
not from Mena, but from the barben aud
they think that the words ‘scitari ex ipso’
confirm this interpretation. But these
words are consistent with t-he supposition
that the slave put the questions to Mena.
nitar, by placing the man under the tree
and the barber of course in the shop, pre-
pares the way sor his explanation, which,
if Meua were in the shop, would hardly be
ible.

pag-5. sirie cn‘mine, notum et] Orelli and
others take ‘ notum ' absolutely for a man
well known, quoting Caesar (B. C. ii. 19) :
“ non civis Romanus paulo notior quin ad
, diem conveniret ;” aud Epp. i 6. 251
“ Cum bene notum Porticus Agrippae et
via te conspexerit Appi.” Lambinus 0011
-many after him take ‘ notum ' nith ‘ sine
mimine? I think it belongs to the verbs
that follow [111111 so Ritter and Kriiger
ωτι-0011] understand 61101111113] which nearly
all the editors suppose to 110μοοᾱ on ‘ gau-
dentem? The description of Meua is
that 110 is a crier of small 11100110, of 0111110-
mished character, well known as a person
who could 110 active or quiet as the occa-
sion (1000) required, and who enjoyed what
110 got3 one who made himself happy in
the company of humble people, iu the

ion of a house of his own, at the
theatres and Circus, and with the amuse-
ments of the Campus Martius. ‘ Et quae-
rere et uti,’ · 10 get and to enjoy‚' expresses
the reverse of him who is ‘ nescius uti
Compositis ' (S. ii. 3. 109). ⁸ Lare certo '
is opposed to a lodging, ¹ coenaculum'
(Epp. i. 1. 91 11.). Ι1 appears (v. 65) that
he transacted business as a seller3 proba-
bly he had some second—hand things of
his own to dispose of. But the ‘ prae-

65

eo ' was not usually the person who mau-
aged an ‘auctio,' which was proeided
over by an ‘ argentarius? aud he employed
ssoegiiligo‘· sinebzerissiti} 6111181ῗ111111;’ ἒζίἶῗεζέ
has adopted ou the slenderest authority,
and explains “ certo patre, honestis paren-
tibus,’' cannot without straining bear the
sense he gives it. He also reads ‘Lare
curto' from two MSS. of Cruquius, com-
paring “ parvo sub lare '¹ (C. iii. 29. 14),
“modicis penatibus ” (Tac. Ann. ii. 84).
But supposing that Horace would have
used ‘curto' where he could have said
fparvoss the expression would only bc a
repetition of ‘ tenui censu’ above, and
‘ certo 110-θ’ is a common phrase, as Bent-
ley himself has shown, as iu virgil (Georg.
iv. 155), “ Et patriam solae et certos
novere penates :”, and (Aen. vi. 673)
‘⁴ Nulli certa domus3 lucis habitamus
opacis.'’ Compare Epp. i. 15. 28: ⁸· Scurra
vagus non qui certum praesepe teneret.”

61. Non sane credere Mena] ‘Sane’
is not commonly used in negative sen-
tences. It is an adverb of emphasis. As
to ‘ benigne ’ see above, v. 16, and 011 1110
subjunctive ‘ neget ' compare S. ii. 6. 31.
“ What, he deny me Ρ ”

65. tunicato serula popello] Suetonius
tells us that Augustus took painstorestore
the old habits of propriety in dress which
had become neglected: “ ac visa quondam
pro contione pullatorum turba indignabun-
dus et clamitans: ‘ En,' ait, ‘ Romanos
rerum dominos gentemque togatam !’ Ne-
gotium aedilibus dedit ne quem posthac
paterentur in Foro Circove nisi positis
lacernis togatum consistere ’' (c. 40). To
be without the toga iu the streets there·
fore was the practice of the lowest sort of
people, which is expressed by the diminu-
tive ‘ popello.' This word is used only
here and by Persius (iv. 15). 011 ‘scruta’
which signifies small wares, Comm. Cruq.
