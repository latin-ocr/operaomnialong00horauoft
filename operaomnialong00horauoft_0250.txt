214 HORATII FLACCI

Irritat amneS. Ille potens sui
Laetusque deget, cui licet in diem
Dixisse Vixi: cras vel atra
Nube polum Pater occupato
Vel sole puro 3 non tamen irritum 45
Quodcunque retro est efficiet, neque
Diffinget infectumque reddet
Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.
Fortuna saevo laeta negotio et
Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax 50
Transmutat incertos honores,
Nunc mihi, nunc alii benigna.
Laudo manentem; si celeres quatit
Pennas resigno quae dedit, et mea
Virtute me involvo probamque 55
Pauperiem sine dote quaero.
Non est meum si mugiat Africis
Malus procellis ad miseras preces
Decurrere, et votis pacisci
Ne Cypriae Tyriaeque merces 60
Addant avaro divitias mari z
Tuncme biremis praesidio scaphae
Tutum per Aegaeos tumultus
Aura feret geminusque Pollux.'
