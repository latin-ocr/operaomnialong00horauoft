469. HORATII FLACCI

(ν. 187). ‘ Why refuse burial to the great Ajax, Ο king ?' ‘ Because he was so mad as
to kill a fiock of sheep and thought he was killing mysses, Menelaus, and me? ‘But
were you sane when you offered your child at Aulis? Ajax spared his own flesh and
blood; and, though he eursed the Atridae, he did not kill either Teucer or even
Ulysses? ‘ But to loose the fleet 1 propitiated the gods with blood.’ ‘Yes, madman,
with your own.’—Any man who takes up false fancies is out of his mind, whether it
be from folly or passion. Ajax was mad ς but when you commit crimes for the sake
of empty titles‚ are you not as mad as he P If a man were to carry about a lamb
and call it his daughter, he would be treated as a lunatio. If on the other hand
he were to take his daughter for a lamb and sacrifice her, he would be called mad
too. The fool then is mad, the depraved is more mad, but the ambitious is maddest
of all.

(v. 224.) “Then for the spendthrift, he is certainly mad. A young man comes into
his father's property: he sends for all the tradesmen and flings his money at
random among them. Another takes a jewel from his mistress' ear, melts it down
and swallows it: another dines habitually on nightingales. Are these mad or not
mad Ρ

(v. 247). “ If we see an elderly gentleman riding on a stick, and playing·at children’s
gamos, we say he is mad. Is not 116 as mad who whines after a harlot Ρ And if so, is
it not better to follow Polemo’s example, to listen to the voice of wisdom, and to east
away the ensigns of lust and repent Ρ Τ116 61111ᾱ who refuses the fruit you offer him,
and if he cannot get it longs to have it, only represents the caprices of lovers squab-
bling and making it up again. Is not the man prattling and playing lovers’ gamas

- with his mistress as mad as the dotard we have mentioned ? to say nothing of the
bloodshed lust osten leads to, as in the case of Marius the other day, who murderod
his mistress and destroyed himself.

(v. 281.) “There was once a libertinus who went about from shrine to shrine praying
the gods to give him immortality. A certain mother vowed if her son recovered
from his fever he should stand up to his chin in the Tiber. The boy recoverS, the
vow is performed, and the fever comes back. Now what was their madness 9-
Superstition.”

(v. 296.) Thus has Stertinius armed me against all the world. If any one says Ι am
mad, 1 can tell him to look at home.

Friend, success attend you. Pray tell me what is my particular madness. 1 am not
aware that I am otherwise than sane.

Did Pentheus’ mother think herself mad even when she carried the head of her poor

⁴ slaughtered son Ρ

Well, 1 admit 1 am mad. But tell me how.

· Why, you are aping Maecenas and building beyond your means, as the dwarf might ape
the giant, or as the frog in the fable aped the bun. Then you write versem 1 say
nothing of your horrible temper-

No more of that!

—or of your living beyond your income—

Mind your own business, Damasippus.

—and your thousand mad amours.

Ο, greater madman, spare one who is less mad than thyself.
