84. vineta mera] So Cicero says
(ad att. ix. 11), ‘⁸ Heras pnoeoeiptiones,

91. Dm: — attensi-eque] Philippus
means that he appears to be too hard-
working aud anxious about his affairs.
Compare S. ii. 6. 82: “Asper et attentus

92. 1²01 me nimum] Gellius (xi. 6)
says, respecting oaths of this sort, that
women never swore by Hercules, nor meu
by Onetor ; but both men and women would
swear by the temple of Pollux, ‘ AedepoL’
and this, -he says,
Varro, was only adopted by men in later
times, whereas it had always been used by
women, who got it from the Eleusinian
mysteria.

94. Quod te per Genium] See Epp. ii.
L 144. This use of the relative ‘quod'
in eutrpaties is common, as in Virgil (Aen.
vi. 363 ι

The Romans believed that every man had
a genius, though their notions on the sub-
je& seem to have been very confused.
According to the name (which involves
the same element as yc'r-sms, yiaeyvopaa) it
should be the attendant on a man’s birth,
as it was believed to be the inseparable
companion of his life. It represented his
spiritual identity, and the character of the
genius was the character of the man.
Varro, quoted by Augustinus (de Civ. Dei,
vii. 13), describes the genius as “ Deus qui
praepositus est ac vim habet omnium
rerum gignendarum ;” and again he says
“Genium uniuscujusque animum rationa—
lem et ideo esse singulos singulorum.”
This explains Epp. ii. 2. 183 sqq. ε

Hence we understand why the marriage·
bed was sacred to the genius (Epp. i. 1.

memorem brevis aevi” (Epp. ii. 1. 143);
and offerings of wine and flowers, and such
like were saidto be presented to the genius
