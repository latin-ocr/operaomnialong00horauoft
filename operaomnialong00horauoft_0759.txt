Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Qui didicit patriae quid debeat et quid amicis,

Quo sit amore parenS, quo frater amandus et- hospes,

Quod sit conscripti, quod judicis officium, quae

Partes in bellum missi ducis, ille profecto 315
Reddere personae scit convenientiacuique.

Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo

Doctum imitatorem et vivas hinc ducere voces.

Interdum speciosa locis morataque recte

Fabula nullius veneris, sine pondere et arte, 320
Valdius oblectat populum meliusque moratur

Quam versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae.

Graiis ingenium, Graiis dedit ore rotundo

Musa loqui, praeter laudem nullius avaris.

Romani pueri longis rationibus assem 325

Discunt in partes centum diducere.

“ Semis.” ⁴ At haec animos aerugo et cura peculi 330

314. Quod sit conscripti] After the
expulsion of the king& the senate having
lost many of its members under the last
hrquinius, the number was made up to
three hundred, by choosing the chief
‘equites’ who were called ‘ conscripti’
(Livy ii. 1). The old members were
‘patrm ς’ and the whole body thus con-
autum was called ⁴ patres et conscripti:
or shortly ‘patres conscripti? Horace
uses ⁸ conscriptus' as equivalent to ‘ sena—
tor? As to -‘ judicis ’ see S. i. 4. 123 n.

318. vivas hinc ducere voees] Living
words are those that represent nature to
the life, or convey a vivid sense to the
understanding.

319. speciosa lom's] Fun of telling
sentiment-s, examples, and so on. (Epp.
ii. 2. 116.) [‘Morataque rectet’ ‘with

, cuneta-s well and truly markedl]

323. Graiis ingenuum] He says the
Greeks had a natural taste for poetry, and
cultivated it from an ambition to excel
and a thirst for praise, which Porphyrion
illustr-ates by the example of Apelles, who

Greeks and Romans does not appear to
be connected with the subject that goes
before or the rules that follow from v. 333.
325. Romani pueri] See S. i. 6. 72.
77 n. The ‘as’ was divided into twelve
‘unciae‚’ of which the ‘ quincunx’
contained five, and the ‘triens' four, be-
ing one-third of the whole, whence the
name. The ‘ semis' contained six, being
half an as. Albinus, according to Comm.
Cruq„ was the name of an usurer. Bent-
ley substitutes ‘dicas' for ‘dicat’ with->
out reason οι· authority. Horace is re-
presenting a scene in a boys' school.
“Mas-ter.- Let the son of Albinus tell
me: if you take an uncia from a quincunx,
how much remains Ρ (The boy hesitates.)
You used to know. Boy .· Α triens.
Maste,- .· Vei-y well. You will know how
to take carc of your money. Now add an
uncia: what is the sum ἓ Boy: A semis-'⁹
Bentley also reads ‘ poterat ' for ‘ poteras?
Some MSS. have that reading. He also
punctuates thus: ‘poterat dixisse, triens?
For ‘at haec' Bentley reads ‘an' [Ritter

took ten years to finish his famous picture has ‘an ']. Orelli says truly there is more
of Venus rising fmm the sea (AopoMrn indignation in ‘at.'
