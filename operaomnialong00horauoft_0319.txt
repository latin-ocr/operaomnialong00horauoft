Ut ora vertat huo et huc
Liberrima indignatio ⁶?

Sectus flagellis hie triumviralibus

Praeconis ad fastidium

Atat Falerni mille fundi jugera
Et Appiam mannis terit,

Sedilibusque magnus in primis eques

Othone contempto sedet!
Quid attinet tot ora navium gravi

Rostrata duci pondere

Contra latrones atque servilem manum

Hoc, hoc tribuno militum ¹?

plies that thepasse passengers turned to one

11. Boebes] Thisis supposed fobe the

'l'he‘ triumviri oep1taloe’ had the power of
summai-ily punishiug slaves. Tine place was
usually at the Maenia columna. It does not·

e. If either were true, both might
be. But the argument from‘ Hibericis'
(see Introdff) is not strong. A crier stood

by while floggings were going on, and kept
godaming the offender's crime. So Plato

ysdowm ιιι the Laws, ii. p. 917 D, that
the swindler shall be flogged at the rate

of one blow for each drachma while the
crier declares his crime. [‘ Praeconis ad

13. Arat Palem] 'I'he Falernian hills
were covered with vines, but the vineyards
were ploug hed between the trees and sown
with corn. The App ian read leading into
Campania would be passed and repassed by
the parvenu as he went to and frum his
estates. ‘Tere’ is equivalent to τρίβω,
which is used 111 the same way.

15. equa] See Introduction. If the
person was a military tribune, he had
equestrian rank; and, if of one of the four
first legions, he had a. seat in the Semte,
and wore the ‘latus clavus? See S. i.
6. 25 n. If he had a property of 400‚000
sesterces, he could, under the law of L.
Roscius Otho (passed AALC. 687), take his
place in any of the fourteen front rows in
the theatre, and laug h at Otho, whose
purpose rposewss to keep thgose seats for persons
of birth. See «lump iii. 154 sqq„ and the
Seholiast thereon, and Horace, Epp. i. 1.

17. ora] Bentley proposes aera,’ but
does not take it into the text. Sanadon
proposes ‘ora aerata.’ But, though the
expression ‘ora navium rostrata’ is new, it
is v cry intelligible, and need not be altered.
A fragment of Anacreon has been preserved
in Athenaeus, xii. 533 E (20 Bergk), which
in some roepoets is so like this Epode that
it seems probable Horace remembered it
as he was writing. He describes a n
named Artemon, who had risen from the
lowest poverty, and was now carried about
like a fine lady m his litter·
