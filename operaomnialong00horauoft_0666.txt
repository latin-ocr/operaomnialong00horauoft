’ EPISTLE XVII.

Who Scaeva was there are no means of determining. He is said by the Scholiast to
have been an ‘ cques,' and they call him Lollius Scaeva from a confusion of this with the
next Epistle. Scaeva was a cognomen of the J unii and Cassii, as Torrentius observes.
There was one of this name a distinguished officer in Caesar’s army (de Bell. civ. 111
53). But it is quite immaterial who this Scaeva was. He bears no partin the Epistle,
which might have been addressed to any body of his age. ΤΙιε professed purpose is to
instruct a young man how to rise in the world by paying court to great people, which

’ is declared to be au art of no small merit. The chief secret of this art is said to be awell-
affected modesty, and a tact in letting your wants be rather felt than heard by your
patron, and this is the only advice that is offered. The Epistle ends abmptly, and is
a mere fragment.

Horace's argument for what we call tuit-hunting, which was the universal practice of
his dny, and grew with the growth of tyranny and the decline of the general liberty
and the morals of the olden time, is that it was necessary, if a man would do good to
himself and his family3 that he who affected to despise it, like Diogenes the Cynic, was
no more independent than he who practised it, but less so3 while the other, like Aristip-
puS, while he sought great people, and exerted himself manfully to gain them, might at
the same time be indifferent to the fruits of succes& being able to accommodate himself
to any condition whatever ; a poor apology for a degrading system. Horace had himself
been a successful courtier, and now, after many years' intimacy with Maecenas, could
talk of his independence, as in the seventh Epistle, and of emulating the indifferenee of
Aristippus 3 but he must have seen as much as any man of the disappointments, pains,
intrigues, jealousies, and crimes that wait upon the practice he recommends. He says
it is true a man may live pretty well in obscurity and poverty; but the scope of ,the
Epistle is to commend and to teach a different doctrine. The subject is taken up again
in the next Epistle.

ARGUMEN T.

Scaeva, you know how to take care of yourself, and how to treat the great people ; still,
though it be but the blind leading the blind, see if you can get a hint or two'from
your humble friend.

If you wish for sleep by night and quiet by day go to quiet Ferentinum. Happiness is
not confined to thc rich ; bc too does well who lives and dies in retirement. But if
you would benefit your friends and yourself, go as poor to the rich man. ⁸ If Aris-
