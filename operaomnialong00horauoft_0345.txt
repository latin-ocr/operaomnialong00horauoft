Nox erat et eaelo fulgebat luna sereno

Inter minora sidera,

Cum tu magnorum numen laesura deorum

In verba jurabas mea,

Artius atque hedera procera adstringitur ilex, 5
Lentis adhaerens brachiis:

Dum pecori lupus et nautis infestus Orion
Turbaret hibernum mare,

Intonsosque agitaret Apollinis aura capillos,

Fore hunc amorem mutuum.

in all ancient representations of Apollo (of
which the Belvedere is a specimen fami-
liar to most readers) he has long hair
either braided οι· flowing, in which re-

he is frequently compared with
Bacchus by the poets. See ovid (Met.
