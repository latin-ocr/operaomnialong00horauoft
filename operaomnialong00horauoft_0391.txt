SATIRARUM Ι. 3.

Quod nisi concedas habeare insuavis, acerbus:

Odisti et fugis ut Rusonem debitor aeris,

Qui nisi cum tristes misero venere Kalendae
Mercedem aut nummos unde unde extricat, amaras
Porrecto jugulo historias captivus ut audit.

comminxit lectum potus mensave catillum

Evandri manibus tritum deiecit, ob hanc rem

Aut positum ante mea quia pullum in parte catini
Sustulit esuriens, minus hoc jucundus amicus

Sit mihi? Quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si

Prodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarit ⁴?

86. Raso-en] Nearly all the old editions
hue ‘ Drusonem‚’ because Porphyrion, ac·

person “Octavius Drusus, a usurer and
writer of historia, to which he obliged his

(Aseena), ‘ Ruso: ‘ Trusoss Cruquius first
approved of ‘ Ruso,’ but Bentley claims the
merit of restoring that name. Philostra-
wbo followed the same callingas Ruso, and
made ιι stipulation with his debtors that
they should, besides paying interest, listen
to his recitatione of his own writings.

87. tristes Kalendae] Epod. ii. 70 n.

[88. ‘unde unde ⁹] These words are
sometimes repeated ς they mean ‘from
some quarter or other.' ⁸ Extricat :’ com-
pare C. iii. 5. 31. An old marian
explains ‘tricae’ to be hairs or threads
which entangle the feet of young sowls.
The sense of ‘extricatus' appears clearly
from a passage of Ulpian (Dig. 9. 2. 27 ξ
30) where ‘ margaritae extricatae ’ are un-

90. catillum Evgndripxmnibus tritum]
The Scholiasts‚ spoiling the joke, have re·

as the Evander of this place, who is clearly
the old king and ally of Aeneas, Porphy-

so that there must have been a good deal
of attention paid to that subject at a very
early period. Compare S. ii. 3. 21 n.
[Sillig, Catal. Artfficum, Wieland, Ritter,
agree in taking Evander to be an artist.
Heindorf doubts, but inclines to the artist,
notwithstanding the allusion to Sisyphus,
S. ii. 3. 21. Orelli argues for the king.
Those who can understand a joke, will be
for the old Arcadian. Doederlein has
proved that Evander cannot be the artist.]

[93. boe] ‘ On this account.’]

95. fide] A form both of the genitive
and dative. C. iii. 7. 4: “Constantis
juvenem fide.”

96. Quis paria essesere] This common
doctrine of the Stoice is noticed by Cicero
(de Pin. iv. 19) and, condemned on the
principles of common sense (sensus cujus-
que et natura rerum) and truth, as here.
‘ Laborant‚’ ‘they are in a dilemma'
[‘when they come to reality,’ to apply
their doctrine. It is doubtful what
word ‘ fere' qualifies. Doederlein connects
