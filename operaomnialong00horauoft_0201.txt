Columella (R. R. i. 6) says, “Apothecae
recte superponentur his locis unde plerum-
que fumus exoritur, quoniam vina celerius
vetustescunt quae fumi quodam tenore
praecocem maturitatem trahunt.''

12. Consule Tullo] L. Volcatius Tullus
was consul A.U.c. 688, the year before
Horace was born. The wine therefore had
probably been in the ‘amphora' npwards of
forty years. Sulla treated the Romans with
wine npwards of forty years old (Plut.
Sull. c. 35), and this is not an extreme age
for some modern wines. An amphora in
the British Museum has this inscrip-
fiola:—

It had therefore been filled during the
Jugurthine war, in the year A.U.0. 64⁷,
when L. Cassius Longinus and C. Mariua
were consuls. This amphora wasfound on
