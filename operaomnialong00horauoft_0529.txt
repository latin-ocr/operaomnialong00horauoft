a plausible conjecture enough, there is no

writes on the subject. Catius’ mles, as we

season for them. See Martia] (xiii. 43) ε

“Lecta suburbanis mittuntur apyrinaramis

Et vernae tuberes: quid tibi cum
Libycis ?”

and 42:

&c “Non tibi de Libycis tuberes?

The great value of the boletus is ex-
proesed in another epigram in exaggerated
i'anguage (xiii. 48):
“Argentum atque aurum facile est lae-
namque togamque
Mittere: boletos mittere difficile est.”
The boletus served to off an emperor.
See Juvenal, l. c.² and Martia] i. 21.

24. Aufidius] Estre thinks this may be
M. Aufidius, who was remarkable as hav-
ing been the first at Rome who bred and
fat tened peacocks for sale, and derived a
large profit (as much as 60,ΟΟΟ sesterces
a year) from that trade. (Pliny, N. H. Χ.
20.;23 VarrodeR.. R. iii. 6.1.) This
person is also identified with M. Aufidius
Lurco, who was tribune of the plebs ΛΑΜ).
693, and author of the Lex Aufidia de
Ambitu. I am not aware that there are
sufficient grounds for either of these con-

man‘s as they are still by the Italians. Of jectures. As to the composition of ‘ mul-

the latter there were and are great varie·
ties. Forsyth (Italy, p. 81) mentium an
astonishing variety of mushrooms, all na·

‘tives of Vallombrosa, a collection of which
(painted) he saw in the monastery of that
place, with this absurd motto, of which the
author aska, rather unnecessarily, whether
it is correct in its etymology :—

The mushroom most highly esteemed was
the boletus, which was cultivated in gar-
dens and kept for the eating of the rich.
See Juvenal (v. 146): “Vilibus ancipites
ponentur amicis, Boletus domino,”
and Martial (iii. 60. 5). “Sunt tibi boleti,
fungos ego sumo suiuus? and i. 21. 2:
“Solus boletos, Caeciliam, voras? ΤῙιε
Libyan mushroom was counted the best of
the wild ones, and the spring was the best

sum’ see note on S. ii. 2. 15 n. Falernian
wine, which Horace appears to have es-
teemed next to Caecubam is here called

‘forte‚' and elsewhere ‘ severum ' and

‘ardens' (C. i. 27. 9; ii. 11. 19). It was
a very strong spirituous wine, and required
long keeping to become mellow. Folsyth
(Italy, p. 264) stopped at Santa Agata (a
modern town in the Falernus Ager) in the
hope of getting some real Falernian ; but
he found it very inferior to the Formian
which he had lately drunk at Mola (For-
miae). [‘ Vacuis: ‘mulso,’ ‘prolueris'
show that he is speaking of the prepa-
ration of the ‘promulsis.’]

27. morabitur] This may have been a
medical word for costivenaes. Forcelliui
does not notice this use of it. ‘Mitulus‚'
the limpet, is notieed as among the ‘viliores
conchae’ by Martial (iii. 60):

‘⁶ Ostrea tu sumis stagno saturata Luci-inm
Sugitur inciso mitulus ore mihi.”
