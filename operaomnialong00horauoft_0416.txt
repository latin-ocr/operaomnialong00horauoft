HORATII FLACCI

Factus homo, Antoni non ut mag-is alter amicus.

Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore libenter Y
Linquimus, insani ridentes praemia scribae, 35
Praetextam et latum clavum prunaeque batillum.

In Mamurrarum lassi deinde urbe manemus,

the nail passes over the surface, and meets
with no obstruction. ‘⁶ Translatio sumpta
a marmorariis qui unguibus juncturas et
levitatem explorant '’ (Comm. Cruq.).
Persius, S. i. 64:—

“ -—— carmina molli
Nunc demum numero fluere, ut per leve
severos
Effundat junctura ungues-'³

Compare also A. P. 294 :⁴ “ Perfectum decies
non castigavit ad unguem.” Plutarch copies
the expression (Symp. vi. 4), ἡ ἀκριβὴς
σφόδρα καὶ δι’ ὄνυχος λεγομένη δίαιτα.
111 S. ii. 7. 86, the perfect man is de-
scribed as·—

“ —- in se ipso totus, teres atque
rotundus,

’ Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari‚”

which is like the description of the text,
though the metaphor is not quite the
same. ‘ Non ut magis alter’ is equivalent
to ‘ quam qui maxime ’ in prose. [A ‘friend
of Antonius as no other was :’ ‘ ut’ denotes
a comparison.]

34. Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore]
They arrived at Tarracina about noon, and
there the principal personages met them.
At Tarracina they slept, and proceeded
next morning to Fundi (Fondi), according
to the Itins. thirteen miles from Tarracina.
Fundi was situated on the north shore of a
lake, which was called after it Fundanus ς
and also AmyclanuS‚ from an ol Greek
town Amyclae, the existence of whi was
only traditional when Horace wrote, but is
occasionally mentioned by the poets. Mar-
tial (xiii. 115) associates it with Fundi and
the Caecuban vineyards, which were in this
neighbourhood :—

“ Caecuba Fundanis generosa coquuntur
Vititingteiiis’media nata palude viret.''

Fundi was one of that class of towns called
‘ praefecturae‚' which, instead of having
the administration of its own affairs, was
governed by a ‘praefectus ' sent annually
from Rome by the Praetor Urbanus. At
this time the ‘ praefectus ' was one Aufidius
Luscus (not otherwise known), an upstart
whom Horace calls Praetor by way of

ridicule. The ‘latus clavus,’ the broad
purple stripe down the front of the ¹ tunic,'
was a badge that belonged only to sena-
tors. ‘ Prunae batillum’ was a pan of
hot coals, “in quo ponuntur prunae in
hieme super mensam ne coena frigeat ’'
(Comm. Cruq.). This Scholiast spells the
word ‘ vatillum‚’ and says it is a diminutive
of ‘ vas? [Ritter has ‘ vatillum,' for which
there is good authority.] “Vas parvum,
in quo pro felici hospitum adventu in-
censis odoribus J ovi hospitali saera fiebant:
quod cum ex cupro esset ita tollebat et
ostentabat hospitibus quasi esset aureum,
et ob hanc causam vocatur ab Horatio
insanus.” A good deal in this explana-
tion is without value ; but the pan of
coals may have been used, as this Scholiast
says, for burning incense or otherwise in
connexion with sacrifice. Aufidius, it ap-
pears, had been a ‘scriba’ or elerk, pro-
bably in the ‘praetor-’s’ office, such a
situation as Horace held in the ‘quaestore’
Per-sons in that capacity had opportunities
of pushing their fortunes if they managed
well, and the honours of Luscus are spoken
of as ‘praemia,' rewards of service rendered
to his master. Livy (xxiii. 19) mentions
that one M. Anicius, praetor (as the prin-
cipal officers in a few of the chief muni-
cipia seem to have been mlled, probabl by
courtesy) of Praeneste, had formerly n
a ‘ scriba.’

37. In Mamurrarum] Di with
the officiousness of the promoted scribe, the
party move on in the course of the day to
Formiae (Mola di Gaeta) thirteen miles
further, where the road, having taken an
inland bend from Tarracina to Fundi, goes
straight down from Fundi to the coast,
where Formiae was situated at the head of
the Sinus Caietanus. Its supposed iden-
tity with the Laestrygonia of Homer has
been noticed (C. iii. 16. 34 n., and 17 Int.).
As the scene of Cicero’s frequent retire-
ment and his death, it is a place of much
interest, and Martial devotes one of his
longest and most pleasing Epigrams to the
description of its attractions (x. 30). The
wines Horace mentions more than once.
He here calls it the city of the Mamurrae
—a family of respectability in this town,
according to Porphyrion (“ hic fuit familia
