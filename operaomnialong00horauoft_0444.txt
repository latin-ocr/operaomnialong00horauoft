HORATII FLACCI

Ad Regem redeo. Postquam nihil inter utrumque
Convenit, (hoc etenim sunt omnes jure molesti 10
Quo fortes quibus adversum bellum incidit : inter ⁸
Hectora Priamiden animosum atque inter Achillem

Ira fuit capitalis ut ultima divideret mors,

Non aliam ob causam nisi quod virtus in utroque

Summa- fuit: duo si discordia vexet inertes, 15

leriique 3 ita deinceps Fabii Quinctii Cor-
nelii.” Plut. de Fort. Rom. c. 3 : βούλεσθε
δὲ πυθώμεθα τίνες ποτέ εἰσιν οὗτοι ; Φαβ-
ρίκιοί φασιν εἶναι καὶ Κάμιλλοι καὶ Λού-
κιοι καὶ Κικίννοιτοι καὶ Μάξιμοι Φάβιοι καὶ
Κλαύδιοι Μάρκελλοι καὶ Σκιπίωνες. See
also above, C. i. 12. 37, where Scauros is
probably put for the best of that family,
M. Aemilius. ‘ Equis albis' is equivalent
to ‘fleet steedsss according to that line of
Virgil, in which he describes the horses of
Turnus “Qui candore nives anteirent,
cursibus auras '³ (Aen. xii. 84). Plautus
speaks of white horses in a proverbial way
for swiftness (Asin. ii. 2. 12) :—

- “ Nam si se huic occasioni tempus subter-

N 111111ζέἑὲ edepol quadrigis albis indi-
piscet postea.”

And as the horses of Jove were said to be

white, this proverb connects itself with
another in the Amphitruo (i. 1. 195):—

“ Mer. Quo agis te? Sos. Domum. Mer.
Quadrigis si nunc inscendas J ovis

Atque hinc fugias, ita vix poteris ecfu- ·

gere infortunium.’'

The Scholiasts also refer 1110 proverb in
the text to the. circumstance, that white
horses were used iu triumphal processions.

9. Postquam nihil inter utrumque con-
venit] When they found 'thoy could not
settle. their quarrel privately‚ they went
before the praetor (v. 18). The digression
that interveues is a comparison between
such disputants and the warriors of the
Iliad. When men fall out, says he, they
sight after the fashion of two bra-ve heroes
engaged in a deadly feud, even as Hector
and Achilles, who hated each other so
mortally, and were so exceedingly brave,
that they could not be separated when
they came together in conflict till one or
other was killed; or else they behave as
when two cowards meet and both are glad
1ο give way; or as when the strong meets
the weak, Diomedes meets Glaucus, and the
weak gives in and humbles himself before
his enemy.

[10. hoe-jure-quo] It is a disputed

question whether the subject is ‘omnes

inter quos non convenit‚’ or, as some sup-.

pose, ‘omnes quibus adversum bellum in-
cidit ε’ but the second opinion is incon-
sistent with ‘ Quo fortes—incidit? In
either case ‘ molesti' is taken as the pre-
dicate. 1 am inclined with Ritter to take
‘omnes molesti' as the subject: ‘for all
sturdy litigants are on the same terms as
the brave2'—‘ capitalis' is that which
touches the ‘caput‚’ the head. See C. i.
24. 3 n. ‘ Capitalis ut ’ is like ‘ Dives ut
metiretur nummos‚' S. i. 1. 95.]

U. inter Hectora—atquemterAchillem]
This repetition of ‘inter' is not uncom-
mon. See Cic. Lael. cs25: “Contio—
judicare solet quid intersit inter popularem
civem, 01 iuter constantem, severum, 01
gravem.'’ And Epp. i. 2. 11 :—

“ Nestor componere lites
Inter Peliden festinat et inter Atriden.”

Bentley, who does not seem 10 have re-
membcred this passage of Cicero or Livy
(x. 7), declares this way of speaking, 'with
the double ‘inter‚' to be ‘vitiosum sane
loquendi genus et ἰδιωτικόν, quodque magni
emerim nunquam ab Horatio prolatum.”
In these words he seems to admit that,
vicious as the language is, it is Horace’s.
But that does not signify. He goes on to
propose ‘ olim Hectora' here, and ‘ Primus
Peliden' in the other place, declaring that
the copyists, surprised at finding the pre-
position with the latter of the two names
in each case, underlined the readings 110
has given with the word ‘ inter‚' and so it
got into the text. It is hard to say which
one should admire most in his note-the
perverseness or the want of taste shown in
the proposed corrections. ‘Animosum’
belongs to ‘ Achillem,' ‘ atque’ being often
put by Horace after the first word of its
clause. See Epod. xvii. 4: “Per atquo
libros carminum ;” also S. i. 5. 4 3 6.

15. vexet] Some of Lambinus' MSS.
had ‘verset’ Bentley and some modern
editors have adopted this reading. All
the old editions, and the great majority of
MSS„ and the oldest, have ‘vexet.' The
