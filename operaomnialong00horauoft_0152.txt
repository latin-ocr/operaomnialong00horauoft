Sappho puellis de popularibus,

HORATII FLACCI

25

Et te sonantem plenius aureo,
Alcaee, plectro dura navis,
Dura fugae mala, dura belli !
Utrumque sacro dig-na silent-io

Mirantur umbrae dicere; sed magis

30

Pugnas et exactos tyrannos
Densum humeris bibit aure volgus.
Quid mirum, ubi illis carminibus stupens
Demittit atras belua centiceps

Aures et intorti capillis

35

Eumenidum recreantur angues?

we have “ J uppiter illa piae secrevit littora
genti ;'' and Vix-gil (Aen. viii. 670) has
“ Seeretosque pios.'' But these prove no-
thing: they rather lead to the inference
that, if Horace had used a compouud of
‘ cerno' here, he would have used ‘seez-etas?
24. querentem Sappho puelli-s· de popu-
laribus] On this Acron says: “Querebatur
autem Sappho de puellis suis civibus quia
non amarent quem ipsa diligebat ;'' which
Porphyrion varies thus: “ quia Oden non
ament quem ipsa diligebat amens.'' Cru-
quius' Scholiast explains their meaning,
and shows the corruption of their text. He
says: “ Querebatur autem Sappho (le puel-
lis suae gentis quod amarent Phaonem quem
ipsa amabat.'' This, however, is probably
not the true explanation. The passionate
tenderness with which Sappho could write
to her young female friends, and her jea-
lousy of rivals m their affections, imply a
state of feelings which we cannot very well
enter into. A woman could only write to
her lover now in such language as Sappho
could address to Atthis, a young friend and
pupil, who had transferred her affections to
Andromeda, a rival of the poetess 2-

Ἔρος δηῦτέ μ’ ὁ λυσιμελὴς δύνει
γλυκύπικρον ἀμάχανον ὄρπετον·
'Aa-ol, σοὶ δ’ ἐμέθεν μὲν ἀπήχθετο
φροντίσδην, ἐπὶ δ’ Ἀνδρομέδαν πότῃ.

(43 Bergk.)

The affection of Socrates for some of his
young pupils was of that sublimated kind
which was liable to be mistaken for a
grosser feeling ; and I consider it next to
impossible for any modern reader fullyto
enter into the language of the “Phaedrus''
and comprehend the quality of the feelings
there describedas Plato understood them, if
he did understand them. [See Thompson' s
Phaedrus. ] On Sappho the readcr may con-

sult Muller's Dorians, Β. iv. chaps. 4, § 8,
and 5, ξ 2; and the same writer-'s Histoi-y
of Greek Lit. p. 176 sqq. Also Welcker's
Sappho von einem herrsolaenden Vor-
urtheil bqfreyt.

27. Alcaee, plectro dura navis] See C.
i. 32. 6 11. [‘ Dura navis,’ ‘dura belli' are
like ‘ cuncta terrarum: C. ii. 1. 23, ‘acuta
belliss C. iv. 4. 76.]

30. Mrantur—dieere] This is another
of Horace’ s many Greek constructione for

‘mirantur dicentes? [‘ Songs worthy of‘
sacred silence’ are as Ritter says‘ ‘digna
eo silentio quod in saeris faciundis obser·
vatur? Compare ‘favete linguisssC. iii.

32} Densum humeris] Bentley, disliking
‘ humerisss and desit-ing an epithet for Ι

‘aure‚’ proposes ‘humili' or ‘avidass but
prefers the latter, because the Scholiasta
interpret ‘bibit’ ‘avide audit,’ ‘cupidis-
sime audit ³ But we may believe that he
who interpreted ‘bibit' ‘avide audit: had
not ‘avida aure’ before him when he wrote.
Bentley is not confident that Horace wrote
‘avida‚' but thinks he would have done
better if he had.

33. carminibus] This is the ablativa
case, as (S. i. 4. 28) “ Stupet Albius aei-02²
(S. ii. 7. 95) “Vel quum Pausiaca torpes,
insane, tabella ;'’ and S. ii. 2. 5.

34. centiceps] Elsewhere Horace repre-
sents Cerberus with three heads (C. ii. 19.
31), and in C. iii. 11. 17 he describes him
with a hundred snakoe gual-dina his head.
Hes iod represents him gwith fisty heads,
but three 15 the more usual account. [The
Scholiasts explain the text by taking

‘centiceps' to mean the heads osy the huu-
drcd snakes. ]

35. intorti] The MSS. favour this read-
ing, though ‘ anguis’ is more commonly
feminine than masculine.
