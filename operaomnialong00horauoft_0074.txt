38 HORATII FLACCI-

riou, whom Lambinus follows, supposes Horace is addressing himself to the fears ‘of
Brutus, and dissuading him from renewing the battle at Philippi, after the death of
Cassius—a strange time for writing verses after the manner of Alcaeus, aud an unusual
way for a military tribune to offer counsel to his commander-in-chief. Acron supposes
Horace to be alluding to the designs of the republican party, under Sextus Pompeius.
This opinion is supported at some length by Buttmann, Mythol. i. 343 sq„ who argues
that the ship does not signify the commonwealth, for that Horace speaks as if he were
separated from the subject of the allegory: that to advise the citizens to abstain from
civil wars (represented by the sea), because they were in a crippled condition, would be to
imply that they might engage in them if they were not in that condition ς also that there
would be no propriety iu representing the state as a dismasted ship in the time of Augus-
tus. He therefore considers that all this refers to the efforts of the broken but restless
party to which Horace had been lately attached to repair their fortunes under the leading
of Sext. Pompeius. ‘ Nudum remigio latus,’ he says, refers to the number of theirbest men
cut off at and since Philippi (he might have added the desertion of Menas). The ‘desi-
derium,' spoken of in v. 18, means the lingering affection and anxiety Horace hadfor the
party he had first cast in his fortunes with, and ‘ taedium’ the vexatiou he had suffered
in common with Brutus and all his best officers at the state of the republican forces at
Philippi. ‘ Pontica pinus' he considers a very masterly allusion to Pompey the Great, as
the conqueror of Mithridates, which is Acron’s opinion. Ι give this theory in deference
to the author, who has few equals in critical sagacity, and who in the essay in which
” these views are put forward has done good service to the interpretation of Horace on the
principles of common sense. I should mention however that the theory has but few
supporters, of whom Gesner certainly is one, and his was no mean judgment. Passow
is another. Franke cannot sufficiently express his astonishment at Buttmann's strange
doctrine. Having made up his mind that none of the odes 111 these three books were
written before Actium, A.U.c. 723, he adopts the opinion of Torrentius, Masson, Sana· ’
don, and others, that Horace wrote this ode at the time when Augustus was thinking of
retiring from the head of affairs (A.U.c. 725), and when he was dissuaded by Maecenas
in a speech in which he likened the state to a vessel tost upon the waters withoutapilot
(Dion Cass. 52. 16). It does not seem to have occurred to Frankc, that supposing the
historian to have related the actual words of Maecenas, which is somewhat improbable,
it is as likely he got his image from Horace as Horace from Maecenas. But the image
was common and always will be, and it is as plain as possible that Horace got his
notion not from Maecenas but from Alcaeus. Besides, the cautious contained in this ode
are plainly addressed, not to Augustus, but to the citizens, and so far from requiring such
cautious, they were importunate in requesting him to remain as he was.

Kirchner‚ who speaks of Buttmann’s opinion as ‘infelicissima,’ has no hesitation in
referring the ode, with Epod. vii„ to the year before the battle of Actium, when the
flames of war were kindling again between Augustus, and Antonius. J ani, Mitsch„
Doering are of the same opinion, and Dillenbr. rather prefers it. Orelli is silent.

Having now stated all the opinions that I have seen upon this much-disputed ode,
Ι must leave the reader to judge for himself. That there was many an hour when
Horace sighed for peace between the day he found himself established in his scribe's

office to that which brought Augustus home in triumph is certain, and that he felt as a .

man of weak nerves might feel in a storin during the troubles of that long period may
well be supposed. I think it is very hard to say at what precise juncture in those stix-ring
times the notion entered his head of sitting down to write an ode in close imitation of
Alcaeus, though we may safely affirm, that the idea would only be natural while Rome
was disturbed, and therefore that the ode was written before the death of Μ. Antonius
in A.U.c. 724. Of the theories above given I prefer Acron’s.
