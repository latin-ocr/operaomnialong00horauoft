Quorum hominum reg-io et qualis via, (nam mihi Baias

migrationi related by Herodotus, i. 165
§3⁰11- xvi. 15 n.). The ruins of the town

‘ exist on the site called Castellamare
dena Brucca. From the Topica of Cicero
(c. i.) and Epp. ad Fam. (vii. 20) we learu
that Trebatius, who is introduced in S. ii.
1, had estates there. On his way from
thenoe to Rhegium, when he fled from
Rmne aster the death of Caesar, Cicero
compiled the Topica, and he wrote the above
letter to Trebatius from that place, and
probably from his house, which he makes
remarks upon. There are coins of Velia
with the inscriptions ΥΕΛΗ. ΥΕΛΗΤΩΝ.
Fama. Salernum in Campania was situ-
ated at the head of the bay of Paestum, now
the Gulf of Salerno, ou the heights above the
nodum town, which is close to the nea. lt
was a Roman colony, but was originally
built only as a fortress to be a check on the
Picentini. iu whose country it was situated.
Thoe were not very much frequented
itwould seam at this time, but a new doc-
tor was bringing them into fashion.

2. Baiae] The atmosphere of Baiae ap-
pears to have been clear, and the place
attractiva (Horace calls it ‘liquidae‚’ C. iii.

4. 24, and ⁸ amoenae,’ Epp. i. 1. 83). This· ν

Bonna. To invalida there was the ad-
difimul attraction of hot sulphureus
springs. See among other places Ovid
, (Δ. Δ. i. 255) :—

Horace had been in the habit of going to
Bitiae, as we may infer from his connecting
it with the Sabine hills, Praeneste, and
Tibur in C. iii. 43 but it appears he was
now advised to try a different treatment,
and seek some other climate. A letter of
Cicero to Dolabella (ad Fam. ix. 12) begins
in this jocular way :—“ Gratulor Baiis nos-
tris siquidem ut scribis salubres repente
fictae suut ε nisi forte te amant et tibi
¹assentantur et tamdiu dum tu ades sunt
oblitae sui.’' The place therefore was not
healthy iu Cicero's opinion, or Dolabella
had hund it disagree with him before.

‘Supervacuas' means ‘useleas,’ the place
would do him no good. [‘Supervacuas'
must also be connected with ‘ facit.']
3. Musa—Antonius] This physicianwas
a freedman of Augustus, and came into
notice chiefly through curing him of an
illness he contracted in the Cantabriau ex·
pedition (Ep. 13. 3), on which occasion
Suetonius (c. 81) tells us that Augustus
‘⁸ distillationibus jecinore vitiato ad despe-
rationem redactus contrariam et ancipitem
rationem medendi necessario subiits quia
calida fomenta non proderant, frigidis
curari coactus, auctore Antonio Musa?
which gave rise to the caustic word· Se-
neca makes Livia address to Augustus (de
Cla-en. i. 9) :—“ Fac quod medici solent,
qui ubi usitata remedia uon procedunt,
tentant contraria? It seems that in
uence of this cure llum came into
fnhion. and having found cold bathiug
successful with the emperor, he appears to
have mule that his general principle of
treatment. He recommended it ιο Ηο·
race, the Scholiast mysi, for his eyes; and
Horace followed his advice. A statue was
erected to Musa by subscription (aere col-
lato) near that of Aesculapius in gratitude
for Augustus' restoration (Sueton. Aug. c.
59), and he also was allowed to wear a gold
ring ; that is, he was made an ‘ eques ’ (Dion
Cass. 53. 30. See S. ii. 7. 9 n.). Eusebius
relatae that he lost his life hy shipwreck.
Pliny (xix. 8. 38) says that Musa was called
iu to Supersede Camelius, the former physi-
cian, and that he successfully administered
lettuce to his patient, which the seruples
(⁸ nimia religio ’) of Camelius had refused
him. Comm. Cruq. says that the disorder
was gout, that camelius raeorted to heating
remedies, going so faras to line the roof of
his bed-chamber with wool ς that Musa
changed the whole treatment, ordered not
only cold baths, but gargles of water from
Atella (in Campania) and cold drinks, by
which means he soon enred him. For this
aei-vice he was presented, the Scholiast·
adds, with forty millions of sesteroes bv a
senatus consultum. From Dion (53. 30)
we learn that Musa attended Marcellus. If
so, it is surprising that he allowed him ιο
go to Baiae, where Marcellus died. The
death of Marcellus may have contributed
to making Baiae unpopular for a time, but
it soon recovered its character (Ep. 1. 83).
There are some fragments of medical
works by Musa, and he is frequently re-
ferred to as an authority by Galen. The
