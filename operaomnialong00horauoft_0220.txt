184 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XVII .

The short ode, C. i. 26, and this ode were addressed to the same person, L. Aelius
Lamia (see Introduction to C. i. 26). The language of the former ode has led to the
inference that Lamia was a young man of desponding disposition, and this that he was
proud and vain-glorious-a sort of criticism impertinent and unreasonable as it seems to
me. What is clear is no more than that Lamia was a young man of good birth, being of
the Aelia gens, who were plebeiam, but of old standing. Like other families the Lamiae
were perhaps glad to trace their origin to a fabulous hero, and believed their founder to
be Lamus, king of the Laestrygonians, the builder of Formiae, from whence they must
have migrated to Rome (see last ode, v. 33 n). Horace had evidently an affection for
the young man Lamia, whose father was a friend of Cicero, and died· rich. It is not
improbable the ode was written at his house in the country, whether at Formiae (“ quod
valde probabile,” says J ani, Ι don't see why) or elsewhere. It has no particular merit,
and could have cost Horace little labour. He must have written many such that have
never been published, and these two odes were probably included in the collection out
of compliment to Lamia. But there is not the least reason why Horace should be sup-
posed not to have been the author of the ode ; and though it might do very well, perhaps
better, without the verses 2 -5, which some editors would strike out (J ani says, “ haud
dubie spurii sunt‚’' and has a long excursus to prove it), but no MSS. omit, it is the
· very worst species of criticism that endeavours to bring, by corrections, omissions, and
additions, the received text into conformity with some standard which is presumed to
represent the mind and style of the author. If this system were not so common, espe-
cially among the commentators of Horace, old and new, it would seem superfluous to
say a word about it. Lamia had a brother Quintus, who died early, to the greatgrief of
Lucius (Epp. i. 14. 6). There was one of this family, according to the Scholiasta Acron

and Porphyrion, who wrote comedies; but there is no reason to suppose it was Horace’s ’

friend. In two passages Juvenal alludes to the Lamiae as a family o'f distinction (S.
iv. 153 :
) “ Sed periit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus
Coeperat3 hoc nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti.”
and (vi. 385) :—
“ Quaedam de numero Lamiarum ac nominis Appi
Et farre et vino Janum Vestamque rogabat ;''

where they are associated with the family of the Appii, though the reading of the MSS.

varies, and ‘ alti ’ is now received. Tacitus (Ann. vi. 27), mentioning the death of this
Lamia, says his ‘ genus’ was ⁶ decorum?

ARGUMENT.

Aelius, ennobled with the blood of Lamus (for like all the Lamiae thou derivest thy birth
from him who founded Formiae and ruled on the banks of the Liris), a storm is com-
ing, get in the wood while it is dry: to-morrow the servants shall have holiday, and
thou wilt do sacrifice to thy genius.
