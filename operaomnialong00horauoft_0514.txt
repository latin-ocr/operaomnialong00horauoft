iv. 1. 19 : “Albanos prope te lacus Ponet
marmoream ;’' and Virg. (Ec. vii. 35) :

The same way of speaking is common in
Greek. ‘Astuta ingenuu1n‚' ὣς. appears
to be nothing but a suitable illustration
invented by Horace. It is obvious
enough, and we need not suppose it a
proverb or a current fable of Aesop or any

onelgsssejve quis humasse velit] This scene

is taken from the remonstrance of Ulysses
with Agamemnon in the Ajax of Sophocles
(v. 1328 sqq.) ‘Veto ’ usually governs the
infinitive mood. Once more, as here, Ho-
race uses it with ‘ ne ’ and the subjunctive
(Epp. ii. 1. 239)= “Edicto vetuit ne quis
se praeter Apellen Pingeret ;’' and once
with the subjunctive, but without ‘ ne '
(C. iii. 2. 26) :

“ — vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus, fragilemve mecum
Solvat phaselon.”
Tibullus has ‘veto' with ‘ut :³
verbis sis mihi lenta veto '’
‘ Atrida ’ is the later form of the vocative.
The Greek ‘Atride’ is used in Epp p. i. ’7.

Horace’ s ‘Atridass is G1·‚eek being the Doric
α for η. ‘’Cur is awkwardly placed, as it
is in S. 7. 104. The connexion with what
precedes lies in the extravagant and impe-
rious conduct of the king as illustrating
the excesses of pride, and proving that
madness is found in high places and in the
heart of kings. Stertinius' is exposing the
folly of ambition. The dialogue is sup-

posed to be between memnon and one
of his soldiers in view of the unburied

corpse of Ajax. ‘Nil ultra quaero ple-
beius’ is interposed hythe soldier: ‘ Ι am
a king,' (⁸1 am one of the common sort,
and darc ask no more! ')—‘ and moreover
the thing is just that I command? There
is a good deal of irony here. The justice
of the command is secondary to the will
of the despot, and his subject is ready with
instinctive awe to admit that it is so ; but
the tyrant condescends to justify his act ς
and the man of low degree, not without
trembling and doubt and astonishment at
such condescension, ventures to ask that
his reason may be enlightened a little,’ 111

Bentley, mistaking the connexion, and
missing the force of the parenthetical hu-
mility of the second speaker, reads ‘quaere’
against the metre, but on· the authority of
the oldest Blandinian MS. As the king
immediately invites comment we need not
make him stultify himself by here refusing
to listen to it. Stephens quotes a Greek
proverb, μώρῳ καὶ βασιλεῖ νόμος ἄγραφος,
‘fools and kings are governed by an un·
written law? Juvenal has “Hoc volo,
