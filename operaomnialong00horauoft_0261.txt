OARMEN IV.

ΛΑΜ). 7 39.

” Thchistoryaf this ode is easily made out. The Vindelici were a tribe whose territoriea
’ layhctwoen the Danube and the lake of Constance, comprising the greater part of
⁷. modern Bavaria and Saabia, and some part of the Tyrol. The Raeti lay to the south
,ἃ σί uio Vindelici, and reached to Lake Como ou the south. These tribea, whom the
,. s lii-turim describe as very fierce and warlike, commenced a system of predatory incur-
’ 2· aim into Cisalpine Gaul, in which they appear to have practised the greatest atro·
j affin (Dian cnm. liv. 22 ; Strabo, p. 206). Augustus was at this time (mu-c. 738—39)
’ Ᾰ Q hunnine Gaul. and Tiberius was with him. Drusus, his step-son, and younger
'J- hnfflcr of Ἐὔα-ἤιε, was Quaestor at Rome, and in his twenty-third year. He was
J nquind byAngustus to take the field against the offending tribes, whom he met under
·· ν &Tridentino Alps and defeated signally. But though driven from Italy they con-
’ tinucd thn'r attacks upon Gaul, and Tiberius was accordingly sent by Angustus with
ᾗ hue tmq» to his brother's asfistanoe, and between them they effectually humbled the

“ >s bibas, whose territories were constituted a Roman province, asterwards named the
, “ limentana Prima or Proper, and Secunda, which embraced the possessione of the Vin-
Ἁ Uici ε these also compi-ised several other tribes, of whom Horace particularly mentions
>the (imni and Breuni. The whole of this war took place in the spring and summer
d flla year asne. 739, and we are led to suppose from C. iv. 14. 3-1-38, that it was
“s'· ' bmght ιο a conclusion in the mouth of August, on the anniversary of the capture of
'5³ Alexandri· by Augustus in the year '724 (C. i. 37, Introduction). In honour of these
4⁷³„ victorico Horace composed this ode and the fourteenth of this book, the one more ex-

ζ munt histodoeny be viewed together. Whether they were written while the wars were
³ ‘a '. ydfioeh, or on the return of Augustus to Rome in the year A.U.c. 741, is doubted;
3 but I incline to think they were written at different times, and should rather, from the
ς dmum of the odes themselves, infer that the first was written immediater on the
ξ, vattingo of Drms’ victory before his brother joined him ; and that the second, which
ἢ· lns much lem spirit in it, was composed on Augustus' return and by his desire, as a
ἔχ’ upphumttothe first. The popularity of Drusus and the hopes that were entertained
ζ ,Of him would create much enthusiasm at Rome on the occasion of his success in his
[ἔτ flu& mpdgn, and there is a hearty and vigorous tone about the fourth ode which does
'Ji-⁶ ΜΕ ⁸ppear ao conspicuously in the fourteenth. Here the praises of Drusus are upper-
hunt in the poet's mind, there Augustus is the real theme, and Tiberius can hardly be
fid to bear more than the second part. Neverthelaes Ι agree with Franke in thinking
it improb-blo thot floraoo wooid have written the fourth ode without an anusion to
mm· if his victorias in conjunction with his brother had taken place, or been known
nt Bone when he composed it. There is indeed tacit reference to Tiberius in v. 28 ς
