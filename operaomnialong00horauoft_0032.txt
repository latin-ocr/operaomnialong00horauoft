in his hands, and have passed into a smooth momtony, which none -

but an emasculated taste can admire when compared with the Greek
⁷ originals. Some may doubt whether the defect does not lie in the
language, and perhaps in some degree it does3 but the later Sapphie
Odes are more like the Greek in point of rhythm, and are so far an
improvement upon the earlier ones. Some of the more difficult long
metres have been as successfully imitated as the language allowed, but
many have not been attempted.

Horace's religious opinions have been a good deal discussed. But he
does not appear at any time to have been very decided in his opinions.
He was upwards of forty when he declared of himself that he was like
a ship driven by a tempest, going this way or that, according as the wind
happened to set. He was now a rigid moralist, now a materialist, now
a Stoic‚ now an Epicurean, now a Cyrenaic. To judge him by his own
writings, he seems to have thought that the enjoyment of the present
hour was the end of man’s life. He nowhere puts forward the happi-
ness of another world as the compensation for the inequalities of this,
nor does he make any allusion to another state of existence at all,
except in the ordinary fabulous way. The certainty of death and the
uncertainty of life are only arguments with him for making the most of
the plcasures we posseSS, but all in the way of moderation, which is a
common-place much dwelt upon by Horace, as also is the possession and
use of riches. Once, if we are to take him at his word, he was startled by
a storm, and induced from an idler to become serious; that is, to put
away the doctrines of Epicurus, for what length of time we do not know.
But of systems he appears to have known little. He ridicules them all
in their turn.

After Maecenas had given him his farm, he lived there a good deal
and improved it at much expenso. He had a liking for the country,
and has some beautiful descriptione of it. But when in the country he
no doubt felt loncIy, and missed the tables and society of his city friends.
He dined a good deal with rich pcople, but his own fare at home was of
the simplest kind. He describes his daily life in the city, when he
happened to be disengaged‚ in the sixth Satire of the first book. His
health was indifferent, as before observed. His eyes in particular
troubled him. He speaks of himself as grey before his time. Suetonius
says he was short and fat, and he describes himself good humouredly
as a fit sample of a hog from Epicurus' sty (Epp. i. 4. 16). Augustus
rallies him on his stature, in a letter of which part is given in Suetonius'
life of Horace.

The life of Horace was written by Porphyrion, the Scholiast frc-
quently referred to in these notes. He mentions that memoir himself:
“ Patre libertino natum esse Horatium et in narratione quam de vita
