Fecit cum stravit ferro pecus?

HORATII FLACCI

Abstinuit vim

Uxore et gnato 3 mala multa precatus Atridis,
Non ille aut Teucrum aut ipsum violavit Ulixen.

Verum ego, ut haerentes adverso litore naves “

Eriperem, prudens placavi sanguine divos.
Nempe tuo, furiose-Meo, sed non furiosus.
Qui species alias veris scelerisque tumultu
Permixtas capiet commotus habebitur, atque

Stultitiane erret nihilum distabit an ira.

Ajax immeritos cum occidit desipit agnos :

Cum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanes,

Stas animo et purum est vitio tibi, cum tumidum est, cor?
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agna-m,

tur Agamemnon.” So also Ven. 1483.
Orelli's three best MSS. go with the two
first Scholiasts. But ‘quorsum ἴθ’ expresses
a sudden and angry interruption of the
king, astonished at the man’s boldness,
while he, being warin, goes on without

heeding Agamemnon's anger.

203. Uxore et gnato] Tecmessa and
Eurysaces (Sophocles, Ajax).

204. Non ille] ‘ Non’ must not be se-
parated from ‘ ille.’ The meaning is ‘not
even he‚' οὐδ’ ἐκεῖνος. So in C. iii. 21. 9:

“ Non ille quanquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus te negliget horridus.’'

205. adverso litore] Orelli, against his
own first and I think better judgment, in-
terprets ‘ adverso' to be the shore opposite
to Troy, where he is now supposed to be.
1 think the shore is called adverse because
they wanted to get away from it and could
not. Properly the winds were adverse, not
the coast at Aulis. But the transfer of
the epithet from the wind to the shore
is in accordance with a common usage.
Comm. Cruq. interprets ‘ adverso ’ by
“ inimico, unde navigare non poteram.'’
[Nempe tuo. See the Argument, and S. i.

207] Meo, sed non furiosus] This is a
very polite reply,c0nsideri11g the provoca-
tion. The colloquy ends here. Horace,
we may presume, had something before
him to suggest what must appear to us a
rather unnatural and far-fetched scene.

208. Qui speeies alias veris] Of this
passage Bentley says it is “locus lubricus
quem nullus interpretum non attigit, nullus
dubium adhuc et incertum non reliquitss’
The old editions and the majority of the

MSS. have ‘ veri.' The oldest Blandinian

and three others quoted by Orelli have
‘veris‚' which he adopts. It gives a good
sense, and Lambinus had taken it into the
text before he knew there was any autho-
rity for it. ‘ Veri scelerisque tumultu
Permixtas’ is very intelligible. But ‘alias '
cannot stand alone. Bentley says it may
in the sense of ‘ alienas a veritate,’ ‘foreign
to the truth ;' or ‘ alias atque ipse opinatus
est3 -' or, if not, he proposes to adopt ‘falsas’
or ‘vanasss “levi mutatione‚” as usual.
He professes not to see what ‘sceleris tu·
multus' can mean, though he could hardly
require to be told that guilt breeds confu-
sion in the mind and' is the parent of error.
The comment of Porph. is “qui concipit
animo species falsas et vera non videtis
demens est,” and that seems to me to be
the meaning: he who entertains fancies
foreign to the truth, and confused through
the blinding power of his own wickedness,
is mad.
211. cum occidit desipit agnos] This is
a clumsy collocation of words ; but it is
not mended by the commas by which ‘de-
sipit' is usually preceded and followed.
212. Cum prudens] Here Bentley
substituted ‘tu’ for ‘cum,’ which he in·
troduces before ‘admittis.' But the MSS.
are unanimous in favour of‘ cum prudens’
and the pronouu is not w.anted (See
v. 234 n.) [¹ Prudens‚' purposely. ] For
‘admittis’ some MSS. have ‘committis'
which was P01ph5r10ns reading [‘ Ad-
mittere scelus' is at full lengthng in se ad-

mittere scelus. ’]
214. Si quis lectica] The‘ lectica' of

the Romans and φορειον of the Greeks
were introduced from Asia, and differed
very slightly from the ‘palankeens' in
which from time immemorial the Asiatica

has
