Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis

HORATII FLACCI

Mendosa est natura, alioqui recta, velut si
Egregie inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos ;
Si neque avaritiam neque sordes aut mala lustra
Objiciet vere quisquam mihi, purus et insons

(Ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis3

Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni
Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,

Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aera:

68. aut mala lustra] The received read-
ing till Bentley was ‘ac' No MS. has
‘aut,' and Bentley and subsequent editors
have supposed no edition had that word ς
but it appears in Ascensius’ edition of 1519.
Where he got it does not appear, for the
Scholiasts whose commentary accompany
his own have ‘ac,’ though Bentley says in
an older copy of Acron printed at Venice
in 1490, and in a MS. of his cominentary

’ in the library of the Royal society, ‘ aut'

appears. It is with very little doubt the
true reading, for Horace repeatedly intro-
duces ‘ aut' aster ‘neque' twice repeated.
Other passages are C. iii. 23. 5 ς S. i. 9. 31 3
ii. 1. 15, 2. 22. ΤῙιε construction with
‘nec' and ‘et’ is of the same kind, and
has been noticed before. [‘Nec mala
lustra‚' Ritter. ‘Lustra' are coupled by
Cicero with ‘popinae' They are brothels
and such places.]

¹71. macro pauper agello] His father’s
small farm at Venusia was confiscated after
the war with Brutus and Cassius.

72. Noluit in Flavi ludum] His father,
who knew the value of a good education,
and formed a right estimate of Horace's
alfilities, would not send him to a small
provincial school kept by one Flavius,
where nothing but arithmetie was taught,
but took him for his education to Rome,
where, though Horace complains that the
teaching lay chiefly iu figures and the
pursuits of a practical life (Epp. ii. 1. 103
sqq„ A. P. 325 sqq.), there were means of
acquiring a knowledge of literature and
the arts. Ovid in like manner was sent
from Sulmo, his native town, to Rome.
(Trist. iv. 10. 16.) ‘Magni‚’ ‘magnis‚'
may mean ‘ big? ‘coarse,' contemptuously,
as Persius says (S. v..189) ι
“ Dixeris haec inter varicosos centuriones ς

Continuo crassum ridet Vulfenius ingens,
Et centum Graecos curto centusselicetur :''

or they may mean ‘importantss as cen-
turions and their sons might be in a small

is repeated in Epp. i. 1. 56. As to ‘sus-
pensi loculos: compare C. i. 2. 31 n.]
Each boy went to school with a bag, iu
which he carried his books aud pens, aud
perhaps his ‘calculi' or pebbles used iu
calculation. ¹The manner of using them

“Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse

'7 5. Ibant octonis] This verse has caused
much difficultyto the commentators. The
meaning of ‘octonis Idibus’ is not clear.
The Scholiasts say that ‘octonis’ is trans· ⁸
ferred by hypallage to ‘Idibus,’ and that
the sum these boys paid their teacher was
eight asses a mouth, payable on the Ides.
Laudinus supposes the money was paid on
the eighth day before the Ides of every
month (which would be the day aster the
Nones, a. d. octavum Idus), or once a year
on the Ides of every eighth month. Doe-
ring calls ‘octonis’ an “epitheton ornans,'’
because there were eight days between the
N ones and Ides. So Orelli and many others
understand the word, supposing ‘aera’ to
