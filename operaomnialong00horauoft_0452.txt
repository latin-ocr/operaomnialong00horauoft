HORATII FLACCI

Umbrae cum Sagana resonarent triste et acutum,
thue lupi barbam variae cum dente colubrae
Abdiderint furtim terris, et imagine cerea
Largior arserit ignis, et ut non testis inultus

Horruerim voces Furiarum et facta duarum:

Nam displosa sonat quantum vesica pepedi
Diffissa nate ficus : at illae currere in urbem.
Canidiae dentes, altum Saganae caliendrum
Excidere atque herbas atque incantata lacertis

Vincula cum mag-no risuque jocoque videres.

and PediatiuS, is stated to have been of a
kind not mentionable. Julius may have
been a freedman of the dictator C. Julius
Caesar, and the other person is said by
Comm. Cruq. and Porphyrion to have been
a Roman eques. The feminine termina-
tion is affixcd to his name to indicate that
he was addicted to the vilest practices, as
Aristophanes (Nub. 678, 680) calls Sos-
tratus and Cleonymus ‘’Sostrata and
- ‘Cleony ma? of ‘Voranus,’ Porphyrion
and Comm. Cruq. give us the following
piece of gossip· “Aiunt Voranum Q. Lu-
tatii Catuli libertum fuisse adeo furacem
ut nummos subreptos a nummulario in
calceos demiserit 5 a quo cum deprehensus
esset, quidam subridens Belle, inquit, si te
non ἐκχαλκεύειε 1100 est verberibus tan-
quam aes recudat, alludens ad calceos.”
It so happens that we meet with this man
again in another Scholium on Juvenal viii.
186, where mention is made of a farce by
one Catullus (an adaptation of the Phasma
of Menander mentioned by Terence, Eu—
nuch, Prol. 9), spoken of as a elever writer
of plays by Martial (v. 30. 3), and by Aulus
Gellius (xix. 9; [but in Gellius the name
should be Catulus, ed. Gronov.]

41. resonarent triste et acutum] This
corresponds with Virgil’s description (Aen.
vi. 492), “pars tollere vocem Exiguam.”
Bentley, seeing no difference between the
continuous action in ‘resonarent' and the
complete action contained in the verbs that
follow, invents, against all the MSS. and
the usage of the language, ‘resouarint‚’ and
affirms positively, ‘sua fide et periculo,'
that this is the word Horace wrote. Inde-
pendently of the imperfect being required
in this place, who ever heard of such a
perfect as ‘ resonaverim ?’ The participles
are so formed, no doubt, as “os magna

50

sonaturum'' (S. i. 4. 44), but Bentley can
produce no better authority than Manilius
and Prudentius for‘ resonavi?

43. cerea] The two last syllables co-
alesce. S.· 1. 7. 30 11.

45. Furiarum] Horace calls the two
witches Furies, by a way of speaking com-
mon to all times since the decline of the
reverential feeling which made the Greeks
shrink from mentioning the name of these
σεμναὶ θεαί. Before Euripides no writer
would have made so free with the name
of the Erinyes. He applies it to Helen
(Orest. 1390, περγάμων Ἀπολλωνίων
Ἐρινύν), and. to Medea (Med. 1260), 33⁶2:
οἴκων τάλαιναν φοινίαν τ Ἐρινὺν ὑπ’ ἀλασ-
τό ων.

Δ(ΙΞ47. currere in urbem] The gai-dens of
Maecenas, we must suppose, were not in
the city. Comp. S. ii. 6. 32.]

48. caliendrum] This is variously stated
to be a wig, or a cap, or some ornament for
the head. The etymology 15 uncertain. 1
have supposed the most ridiculous of the
above articles to be meant. [Ritter says.

‘Epitheton altum non committit ut suppo-
sitos capillos accipiamus; immo fuit vela-
mentum galero simile, quod de capite ceci·
disse additum altwm significat? Τ110 ‘ sup-
positi capilli ’ may be such monstrous knots
of false hair as women wear now (1868).
The teeth must be supposed to be arti-
ficial. Kirchner, quoted by Doederlein,
refers to Cicero De Legibus, ii. 24, ‘cui
auro dentes vincti essent? as evidence that
the Roman dentists used gold to secure
artificial teeth.]

50. Vincula] These may mean love-
knots or long grass woven into chains for
refractory and faithless lovers. [Comp.
Virg. Ecl. viii. 74.]
