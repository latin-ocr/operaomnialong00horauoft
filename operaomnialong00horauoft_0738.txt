Scis simulare : quid hoc, si fractis enatat exspes
Navibus aere dato qui pingitur?

HORATII FLACCI

Amphora coepit 2⁰

Institui 3 currente rota cur urceus exit?
Denique sit quidvis simplex dumtaxat et unum.
Maxima pars vatum, pater et juvenes patre digni,

Decipimur specie recti z brevis esse laboro,

Obscurus fio ς sectantem levia nervi

Deficiunt animique 3 professus grandia turget;
Serpit humi tutus nimium timidusque procellae3
Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter unam,

Delphinum silvis appingit, fluctibus aprum.

30·

111 vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte.
Aemilium circa ludum faber unus et ungues
Exprimet et molles imitabitur aere capillos,
Infelix operis summa quia ponere totum

Nesciet.

Hunc ego me, si quid componere curem,

Non magis esse velim qnam naso vivere pravo,
Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque capillo.
Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus et versate diu quid ferre recusent,

21. Amphora coepit institui] Of the
‘amphora‚’ ‘diota,’ ‘ cadus‚' ‘testas ‘la-
gena ' (all which names represent the same
kind of vessel for keeping wine, oil, honey,
ὅσα), drawings will be found in the Dict.
Ant. It was usually of clay, but sometimes
of glass. ‘ Urceus ' was the name for a jug
of earthenware or glass, of which spccimens
of many different shapes have been found
at Pompeii. As to the ‘rota figularis' and
other matters connected with the art of
pottery as practised by the ancients, see
the Dict. Ant. art. ¹ Fictile?

[23. quidvis] ‘ Quodvis‚’ the reading of
the best MSS„ Ritter.]

24. pater et juvenes patre digni] See
Introduction. Most poets, are led into
error by some standard of correctness that
they have set themselves, some rnle to
which they adhere. One man thinks
brevity the right thing, another smooth-
ness of versification, another grandilo-
qucnce, another cantion, another vanity,
and to avoid the opposites of these they
run into the excess of them. For ‘levia '
Bentley reads ‘ lenia! ‘ Prodigialiter’
(‘ monstrously ') belongs to ‘ variare?
[Kriiger has ‘ rem, prodigialiter nna Del-
phinum? &c.]

32. Aemilium cirea ludum] This illus-
trates the case of those who can invent

details, but cannot compose an entire
poem. Porphyrion says: ‘Aemilii Lepidi
ludus gladiatorius fuit, qnod nunc Poly-
cleti balneum est.' The reading of nearly
all the MSS. and all the editions till
Bentley's and that of the Scholiasta was
‘faber imus? [Ritter has ‘faber imus.']
Acron makes ‘Imus’ the name of the
‘aerarius‚' while Porphyrion says it means
the farthest corner of the ‘ludus‚' which
is inconsistent with ⁴‘circa.’ ‘ Imus ' has
no meaning, and Bentley has done well to
restore ‘nnus' in the sense it bears 111
S. i. 10. 42, “unus vivorum Fundani ;’'
ii. 3. 24, “mercarier unus Cum lucro
noram 5²⁵ 6. 57 11., “ 111111111 Scilicet egregii
mortalem altique silenti.” Bentley, Orelli,
and Fea quote a few MSS. 111 favour of
‘ unus,’ and the verse is quoted with that
word by John of Salisbury in the prefaoe
to his Policraticus or Nugae Cui-iulium
(vi.). ‘ Imus ’ and ‘ nnus ’ have been con-
founded in another place (S. i. 4. 87). In
an uncial MS. VNVS might easily be mis-
taken for nuvs. Ι

38. Sumite materiam] The next con-
sideration is the 6110166 of a subject, which
should be well weighed with reference to
the powers of the writer (‘ potenter‚' κατὰ
δύναμιν).
