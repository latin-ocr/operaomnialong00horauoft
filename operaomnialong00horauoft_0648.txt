EPISTLE XIII.

This letter professes to be written by Horace to one Vinius, the bearer of certain
volumes of his to Augustus at Rome, Horace being probably at his own estate. He
writes as if he had given his friend particular and anxious instructions when he started
as to his behaviour, and as if this was to be sent after him to overtake him on the road,
in order to impress the instructions upon his memory. It is probable that some such
jokes may have passed between Horace and his messenger when he started, and that he
amused himself afterwards by putting them into the form of this Epistle, which it is not
unlikely he showed Augustus ; but more Ι think is made of it iu this respect than it
will bear, as if it were written for the especial purpose of commending to Augustus the
modesty of the writer, and apologizing for the intrusion, and so forth. I cannot see
any such design. The person is assumed to be ignorant of the world, and therefore

’ liable to make mistakes in the execution of his mission 3 to intrude at an unseasonable
time3 in the eagerness of his affection for Horace to be too officione ς to carry the books
awkwardly, so as to draw attention, or to stop in the streete in order to tell his carious
friends what important business he was upon. The person addressed is called Vinius,
and the allusion in v. 8 leads to the inference that his cognomen was Asellus, or Asina,
or Asella. Asellus was a cognomen of the Annia, Claudia, and Cornelia gentes. Asina
also was of the Cornelia. Porphyrion calls the man Vinnius Asella‚ while the other
Scholiasts call him Caninius (which may be an error for Caius) vinnius Fronto. There
was one T. Vinius Philopoemen proscribed by the triumvirs for concealing his patro·
nus, whose name therefore was the same, and the Vinia gens was in existence at this
time. It has been conjectured by'Dacier‚ and believed by others, that the person here
addressed was one of the five tenants mentioned in the next Epistle‚ v. 3. The con-
jecture may be taken for what it is worth. No one ean deny that he may have been
one of those persons. He was not, as Orelli says, a ‘ tabellarius ’ or letter carn-ier, as his
name sufficiently shows, for a ‘tabellarius' was a slave, yet some have treated him as
such.

What the volumes were that Horace was sending to Augustus it is impossible to say,
but they may have contained the first three books of the Odes, and, if su, the Epistle
was probably written in A.U.c. 730. Franke thinks so very decidedly 3 but all do not
adopt that date, and some suppose the Satires to be the ⁸ volumina' referred to.
