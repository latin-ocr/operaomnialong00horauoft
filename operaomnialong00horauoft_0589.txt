Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto.

Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque3
Sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt,
Plebs eris. At pueri ludentes, “ Rex eris,'’ aiunt,

Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
Roscia, dic sodeS, melior lex an puerorum est

Nenia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,
Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis?

Isne tibi melius suadet qui rem facias, rem,

Si possis recte, si non quocunque modo rem,

It heightsm the foroe of the picture by
ruproemting the sort of lesson meu of all
ages are spending their lives on learning,
themflng up of accounts, as Gesner re-
marks. Asto‘ dictata’ seeS. i. 10. 7511.
Plato (nep. iii. p. 407, Steph.) notes a
verse of Phocylides (Bergk. Poet. yr. Gr.
p. 840), bidding men first seek the means
of subsistence gand then practise virtue
when they have got them: δίζησθαι
βιοτήν, ἀρετὴν δ’ ὅταν ᾖ βίος ἀσκεῖν,

which shows that ‘virtus post nummos'

οἷ παῖδες οἳ σφαιρίζοντες, ὄνος· ὣς δ’ ἂν
περιγένηται ἂν ος, βασιλεύσει {mir
καὶ ἐπιτάξει ὅτι ἃν βούληται ἀποκρίνεσθαι.
On which there’ ιε a long Scholiast’s note.

τῶν οὖν παιζόντων ταῦτα (i. e. τὴν σφαῖ-
ραν) τοὺς μὲν νικῶντας βασιλεις ἐκάλουν,
καὶ ὅτι ἃν προσέτασσον τοις ἄλλοις ὑπ-

ήκουον, τοὺς δ’ ἡττωμένους ὄνους. Tbey
who threw or caught the hall best were

called kings; while they who were beaten

nort. and will not be allowed, under Otho' s
law (the Roscia Lex,13.c. 67), ω sit iu the

182) puts the opposite case, and says :—
* Quadringenta tibi si quis Deus aut similis

Ex qffltgsfiesss'

‘Plebs’ isuot used in its regular sense,
but contemptuously, ‘a common fellow.’
The equestrian order now consisted of all
citizens who had t-he above fortune and were
not senators: for when a man became a
senator he ceased to be au ‘eques’ [The
hest MSS. place v. 58 before v. 57, Rittcr,
who also has ‘ est lingua fidesque.']

59. At pueri ludentes, Rex eris, aiunt]
Seenote on C. i. 36. 8. Plato makes So-
crates say (Theaet. i. 146, Ste p.h): τίς ἃν
ἧμῦν *piros εἴποις ὁ δὲ ἁμαρτών, καὶ ὃς

b iet ἅμαρτάνῃ, καθεδεῖται, ὥσπερ φασὶν

verb. The world inav gdespise vou, he says,
because you are poor, but according tothe
boys* rule which makes tue best man king, '
you shall be a king if you do well. As
to ‘murus aeneus’ see C. iii. 3. 65 n. For
the different senses in which Horace uses
‘nenia ’ see Epod. xvii. 29 ιι. Here it
signifies a sort of song of triumph.

64. Et maribus Curiis et decantata
Camillis] On this pluml seeS. i. 7. 8. The
persons referred to are M’.Curius Dentatus,
the conqueror of Pyrrhus, and M. Furius
Camillus, the man who saved Rome from
the Gauls. Curius' contempt for money is
related by Cicero (de Senect. c. 16) in
tei-ms which account for Horace’s selecting
him for an illustnition here. “Curio ad
focum sedenti magnum auri pondus Sam-
nites cum attulissent, repudiati s'unt, non
enim aurum habere praeclarum sibi videri
dixit, sed iis qui haberent aurum im'pe-
rare.” The boys' strain was ever in the
mouths of these noble soldiers, giving ho-
nour to none but the worthy. ‘ Mares ' is
used in this sense iu A. Ρ. 402: “Tyrtae2
nsque mares animos in Martia bella Versibus
exacuit.'’ We use ‘ masculine ’ in the same
way, [⁶ Suadet’ serves twice in this verse——

‘tibi suadet: and ‘ qui suadet mmfacias']
