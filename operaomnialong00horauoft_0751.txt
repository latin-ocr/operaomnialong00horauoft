Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile
Defendet, neu quid medios intercinat actus

Quod non proposito conducat et haereat apte.

Ille bonis faveatque et consilietur amice,
Et regat iratos et amet peccare timentem
Ille dapes laudet mensae brevis, illc salubrem
Justitiam legesque et apertis otia portis;

⁴ Ille tegat commissa deosque precetur et oret,

Ut redeat miseris, abeat fortuna superbis.
Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta tubaeque

than three actors are on the stage at once,
acme of them cau have little to say.

193. Actoris· partes chorus] The chorus
should sustain in its place and to the best
of its power the part of an actor; that is,
instead of singing what is irrelevant to the
plot, it ought tocarry on the action. ‘ Offi-
ciumque virile defendat’ is a way of express-
ing, ‘it'must sustain a sti-eunoun part‚’ or
⁴ do its duty strenuously? Horace uses
‘defendente vicem ’ in the same sense (S.
i. 10. 12). [Kriiger compares “ officium-
que virile ’ with the expression ¹ pro virili
parte-’J Horace’s rule was followed by
Aoeehylus and Sophocles, but not always by
Euripides, with whom “ the choral sougff
have frequently little or uo connexion with
the fable and are nothing better than a
Ἐῑῗῗὲὲῗᾱέῗοῖἓῒᾷῗῗ. {fflifigfssifflssss
τὸν χορὸν δὲ ἕνα δεῖ ὑπολαβεῖν τῶν ὑποκρι-
τῦν, καὶ μόριον εἶναι τοῦ ὅλου, καὶ συνα-
γωνίζεσθαι μὴ ὅπερ παρ’ Εὐριπίδῃ ἄλλ’
es παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ. As respects Euripides
these remarks are not always true. Some
of the choi-uses in his extant plays are per-
tinent enough.

197. amet peccare timentes] Nem-ly
every MS. aud edition, old and modern,
has ‘ timentes,' and the commen-
tntms compare the words with Epp. i. 16.
52 ε “ Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore.”
From one MS. of Pulmann‚ Bentley edited
⁶ pacare tumentes? and Orelli [and K riiger]
adopt that reading. Ι see no reason for
doing so. The office ascribed to the chorus
by Horace is “a general expression of
moral sympathy, exhortation‚ instruction,
and warniug,'’ which Schlegel conside-rs
the best doecription that has been given.
He considers it ‘⁴ as a personified reflection
on the action that is going on; the incor-
poration into the representation itself of
the sentiments of the poet as the spokes-
man of the whole human racc. The chorus
is the ideal spectator. It mitigates the im-

pression of a heart-rending or moving story,
while it couveys to the actual spectator a
lyrical and musical expression of his own
cinctione, and elcvates him to the region
of contemplation '’ (Dram. Lit. Lect. v.).
In plain terms, the business of the chorus
was to utter such reflections as any indif-
ferent us might conceive on the action
before it, aud to address those reflections
to the characters represented, as oue might
address them to real persons under the
same circumstances.

198. mensae brevis] Compare Epp. i.
14. 35, ‘⁶ coena brevis juvat;” aud with
‘¹ apertis otia portis‚” compare C. iii. 5. 23,
“portasque nou clansas‚’' representing a
picture of national security aud peace.
The chorus, to whom the principal persons
communicated their intended crimes and
deepest plots, were held to secrecy as a
prime duty. Thus Medea tells the chorus

er intention to murder her children and
her rival, and reckons upon their secrecy
as a matter of course. Other instanoes
are numerous.

202. fflianonutnunc orichalco vineta]
The ‘tibia’ was an instrument originally
made of a hollow reed (Pliny xvi. 36. 66),
or a box-wood pipe (ovid, Fast. vi. 697),
or the shin-bone of some animal, from
which the name is derived. Asterwards it
was brought to greater perfection, and
was made of ivory sometimes. It roeem-
bled the flageolet or clarionet. It was
usual to play two ‘tibiae' together, as ob-
served ou C. iv. 15. 30 n. Those in the
British Museum have six holos. Probably
in the days of Horace they had more. The
metal which the ancients called ‘ orichal-
cum ' is unknown. It was not found even
in Pliny's time (H. N. 33. c. 2). The
Greek form of the word is ὄρείχαλκος,
mountain-copper. With this metal the
parts of the ⁸ tibia,’ which took to piecoe

as our flutes do, were bound at the joiu- *

ings. Bentley and others prefer ‘juncta’
