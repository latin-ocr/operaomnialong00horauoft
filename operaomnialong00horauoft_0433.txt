SATIRARUM 1. 6.

Praesertim cautum dignos assumere prava
Ambitione procul. Felicem dicere non hoc

Me possum casu quod te sortitus amicum;
Nulla etenim mihi te fors obtulit ε optimus olim

Virgilius, post hunc Varius dixere quid essem.

Ut veni coram singultim pauca locutus,

Infans namque pudor prohibebat plura profari,
Non ego me claro natum patre, non ego circum
Me Satureiano vectari rura caballo,

Sed quod eram narro. Respondes ut tuus est mos

Pauca: abeo, et revocas nono post mense jubesque
Esse in amicorum numero. Magnum hoc ego duco
Quod placui tibi qui turpi secernis honestum,

Non patre praeclaro sed vita et pectore puro.

was a place in Apulia. The lengthening

Others explain Saturi Tarenti ιιι the above
passage of Virgil from Saturus being a
divinity particulme womhipped by the
Tarentines (Cic. in Verr. ii. 4. 60). This
would make‘ Sat. caballo' merelya Taren·
fine horse.

64. sed vita et pectore puro] ‘Not as
being the son of a distinguished father,
but because my life and heart were pure.⁵
Orelli says this interpretation is “prorsus
imperita,” and he applies ‘ vita et pectore
puro’ to the father, ‘as born of a father
not distinguished, but of life and hem-'t
pure: '[but the true interpretation is given
in the third edition of Orelli]
