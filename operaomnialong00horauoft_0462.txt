426 HORA'PII FLACCI

quire whether it was from the nature of his mind or of his subject that Lucilius wrote
clumsy verses, such as any one would write who thought more of quantity than
quality, like Cassius whose books were burnt on his own funeral pile? Grant him

all the wit and eloquence you please‚ yet if he had lived till now he would have cor-
rected much that he wrote, and taken more pains than he did.

If you wish to write well, correct what you write, and look for the approval not of the
η multitude but of the few. You are not ambitious surely of your verses being hacked
in cheap schools. If you are, I am not. I look for the applause of better judges.

Am I to be put out by the abuse of a vulgar rabble Ρ Let my noble band of

learned and loving friends be pleased and Ῑ want no more. Demetrius and
Tigellius may go and whine to their pupils. And so, boy, let this be my valediction

to them all.

NEMPE incomposito dixi pede currere versus

Lucili.

Quis tam Lucili fautor inepte est

Ut non hoc fateatur? At idem quod sale multo

Urbem defri-cuit charta laudatur eadem.

Nec tamen hoc tribuens dederim quoque cetera ς nam sie 5
Et Laberi mimos ut pulchra poemata mirer.

[1. Nempe] See the Introduction. The
word ‘ nempe ¹ concedes, as a Scholiast says.
“ It also confirms. Compare S. ii. 3. 207 ς
7. 80. ‘Nempe,' it is supposed, may be
another form of ‘ namque’ (S. i. 5. 101).]

3. At idem] “‘At’ denotes rather ad-
dition than opposition. It is commonly
employed after aconcession'' (Key’s L. G.,
1445). ‘You say and 1 admit it, still in
the same Satire I praised him?

4. defricuit] This word is nowhere else
used in this sense. It means to give a
hard rub, as we say. There are other vul-
garisms in our own language akin to this
expression.

[— eadem] S. i. 4. 8.]

6. Et Laberi mimos] Laberius was the
most distinguished writer of this particular
kind of play that we know of. He died

the year before the battle of Philippi, -

A.U.c. 711, and therefore before this Satire
was written. The Roman mimes were in
the time of Laberius represented in the
theatres with the regular drama, and were
accordingly, we may believe, of a higher
order than those representations which at
an earlier period bore this name, though
still they appear to have been of a licen-
tious character. They were a combination
of grotesque ‹lumb-show, of farcical repre-
sentations in verse—dialogue, of ineidents
in low and profligate life, and of grave
sentiments and satirical allusions inter-
spersed with the dialogue. Of these, as
in the Atellanae Fabulae; the first element

tat²on was gradually superseded by the
mim), which came to be in t favour.
This appears to have been the only purely
Roman conception of the Drama3 for
though the name is derived from the Greek,
the characters of the Greek and Latin
mimes were essentially different. Thac
they were very popular we know. When
Ovid would excuse himself to Augustus,
he writes (Trist. ii. 497 sqq.) ε

“ Quid si scripsissem mimos obscaena jo-

Qticimtiggiper juncti nomen amoris ha.-

In qulibiiss {ssidue cultus procedit adulter,

Verbaque dat stulto callida. nupta

Nubil'ilg¹0 hos virgo matronaque virque
puerque v

Spectat, et e magna parte senatus ‚ ²

adest ;'’

and he adds that Augustus himself was a
great patron of these licentious represen-
tations. From a prologus written by
Laberius (and preserved in Macrobius,
Saturn. ii. 7) on a famous oceasion. on
which C. Julius Caesar (13.0. 45) caused
him though an ‘eques' to act in his own
farce, we may believe that Laberius did
something to raise the tone of these plays.
But, without meaning personally to dis-

poemata‚' since they could not even have

chiefly prcvailed. That class of represen- pretended to the title of poems at all.
