geneum me that ‘ lucet eamus ’ may mean,

· ‘it is clear we should gn.’ 1 have never

met with that interpretation, but 1 leave
it for the render to consider.

58. plagas, ambula] As to ‘plagae‚’
sec C. i. 1. 28 n. They were too large to
be carried by men, and were carried on
mules (Epp- 18. 46). They were sometimes
of enormous extent (Epod. ii. 32.) A
modern writer (Swinburne, The Two Sici-
lieu. i. 163) writes that 'Alphonso Ι. en-
closed eighteen miles of the country near
P ’ in Puglia (Apulia) with toils, and
'aasz many stags, that besides what was
taken away by the hunters, he sent 400
head to be salted for the use of the garri-
sons of Trani and Barletta. These toils
were ‘plagae’ The ‘venabulum’ was a
long hunting spear, such as hog-hunters
use in India, with a barbed point. Such a
one is carried by one of the centaurs in
the picture of the lion and centaurs found
in the tragic poet’s house at Pompeii.
virgil (Aen. iv. 131), describing the hunt·
ilg-pnrty of Aeneas and Dido, says,—

’ 59. Differ-ium transire sorum populum·
qne] Because ‘differtum ' (Sat. i. 5. 4)
does not suit ‘ populum‚’ and because
‘populo ' occurs in the next verse, Bentley
lus put in ⁶ campumque ³ for ‘populumque ’
ont of his own head. There is no difficulty
iu the text, which is that of all the MSS.
The editor who could not only suggest an
alteration, but take it into the text with
confideuoe, rejecting the reading of all
MSS. and previous editions, with “abeat

in malam rem inficeta lectio ‘ populum-
que,’ ’' is not to be argued with. Obbarins

61. Gradi tumidiqnte lat-emur] It would
seem that some glutwns, with the idea of
renewing their appetite, went to bathe
immediately aster dinner as well as (which
was the general practice) immediately be·
fore. lt can hardly be supposed that under
any circumstances such a process, which
was op to digestion and sometimes
fatal, could have promoted an appetite.
Persius (iii. 98) says “Turgidus hic epulis
atque albo ventre lavatur,'' and then de-
scribes the man carried from table in a fit
of apoplexy. Juvenal (i. 142) :—

62. Caerite cera diym'] Caere (Cer-
vetri) was a very ancient town of Etruria,
about twenty-seven miles north of Rome.
It was called by the Greeks Ἀγύλλα.
About ΛΑΜ). 400, the people of Tarquinii
having taken up arms against the Romans,
the Caerites were accused of aiding them,
and were threatened with punishment, but
having asked pardon they obtained it at
theexpense of half their territory. They
were also granted the Roman citizenship
without the ‘ suffragium ³ or right of voting
for magistrates. lt is disputed whether
this was given them on the occasion last
mentioned, in which case it would appear
more as a punishment than a reward; or
on 'the retirement of the Gauls before the
destruction of Rome, on which occasion
they rendered important service. Gellius
says it was at this latter time (xvi. 13),
and hc says they were the first that re-
ceived the franchise in this form “sine
suffragii jnre.” Porphyrion says distinctly
this limited franchise was laid upon them
as a disgraee, ‘⁶ victis Caeritibus Romani
in percutiendo foedere non dederunt suf-
fragii ferendi jus, quod ignominiosum
