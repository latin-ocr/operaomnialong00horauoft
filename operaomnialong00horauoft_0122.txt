Q. HORATII· FLACCI

CARMINUM

LIBER SECUNDUS.

 

OARMEN I.
A.u.c. 724—725.

POLLIO retired from public affairs, in which he had taken an active part for twenty
years», after the triumph he obtained for his victory over the Parthini, an Illyrian people‚
A.U.o. 715 (ν. 16), and betook himself to literature, but confined himself at first chiefly
⁴ to dramatic writing. It appears from Suetonius (de Illust. Gram. c. 10) that he did not
undertake his history till after the death of Sallust, ΔΑΜ). '720 (see Cliuton, F. H. a.
39 B.c.), for it was after that event that he became acquainted with the grammarian
Atteius‚ who furnished him with rules for composition. And if the history was not
begun till that year, even though (as‘ 1s probable) Pollio should have taken notes of most
of the transactions he had to relate, with a great many of which he had been personally ,
connected, it is not probable that so large a work, consisting of seventeen books, and
taking' m the whole period from the coalition of Caesar, PompeiuS‚ and Crassus to the
conclusion of the civil wars, could have been so far completed as to be communicated
to his friends before the year A.U.c. 723, which was the year of the battle of Actium.
But the words “arma nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus '' (v. 4 sq.)‚ coupled with
“ cui dabit partes scelus expiandi J uppiter ” (C. i. 2. 20 sq.)‚ make it likely that these ⁴
two odes were written about the same time ς that is to say, shortly after the battle and
before Augustus had established his government in the confidence of the people. It is
true Lambinus and some of the older commentatore were of opinion that the history
of Pollio is not meant, but only his tragedies, which they say related to the events of
the times, and which Horace wishes him to lay aside for a while and give his attention
to public affairs, until the republic should be settled. So they interpret
“ mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris grande munus

Cecropio repetes cothurno?

 

But there' is no reason to suppose any of Pollio’ s tragedies had reference to the events
of the day, while his history related to nothing else. The Scholiasts understood the·
history to be referred to (see note on v. 10).

The ode was written after hearing Pollio recite part of his w·ork , a practice which
he is said to have introduced among literar-y men at Rome.

ARGUMENT.

The civil wal-S, their causes, their faults, their progreSS, the sports of fortune, and the
fatal lcagues of chiefs, and arms stained with blood not yet atoned for—a dangerous
task is thiae, and treachcrous is the ground thou art treading.
