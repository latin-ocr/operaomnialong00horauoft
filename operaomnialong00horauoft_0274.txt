HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN VIII.

All that is known of C. Marcius Censorinus, the person to whom this ode is ad-
dressed, may be found in Smith’s Dict. Biog. (Censorinus, 6). He was a man of birth
and education, and much beloved, according to Velleius (ii. 102), who says of his

death, “ Graviter tulit civitas.’'

Horace pays him the compliment of believing that

he would esteem an ode of his more highly than any costly giflzs he could offer in
accordance with the common practice among friends of making each other presente

(strenae) on new-year’s day and other festivals.

We have no means of determining

when the ode was written. But see C. iv. 6, Introduction.

ARGUMENT.
If I were rich in statues and pictures, I would give such to my friends, and the best

to thee, Censorinus.

But I have none, and thou desirest not these. What 1 have

I offer,—verses in which thou delightest. No monuments of marble‚ not their
own mighty deeds could ennoble the Scipiones like Ennius’ verses. Thine own
virtues must remain obscure but for the muse. What would Aeacus or Romulus
have been without her Ρ She raises men to the skies, as she did Hercules, the

Tyndaridae, and Liber.

DONAREM pateras grataque commodus,
Censorine, meis aera sodalibus,

Donarem tripodas, praemia fortium

Graiorum, neque tu pessima munerum

Ferres, divite me scilicet artium 5
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopas,

Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

Sed non haec mihi vis, non tibi talium

Res est aut animus deliciarum egens.

1. commodus] Liberally. “ Miscentur
cyathis pocula commodis '’ (C. iii. 19. 12).
5. artium] ‘Artes’ as ‘works of art’
occurs in the same sense Epp. i. 6. 17:
“ Mamor vetus aeraque et artes Suspice.''
Also in Cic. (de Legg. ii. 2), “ antiquorum
artibus ;’' and in Virg. (Aen. v. 359),
“ clipeum — Didymaonis artes? This
sense of ‘proferre‚’ to produce as we say
a work of art, is not given by Forcell.
‘ Ponere’ is a more common word.. Per-
sius uses it (i. 70) :—

Nugari solitos Graece, nec ponere
