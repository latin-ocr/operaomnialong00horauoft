HonATII FLACCI

Ne populum extrema toties exoret arena.

Est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet-aurem ε
Solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne
Peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat.

Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono,

10

Quid verum atque decens curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum 3
Condo et compono quae mox depromere possim.

Ac nc forte rog-es quo me duce, quo lare tuter,

Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri

Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes.

Nunc agilis fio et mersor civilibus undis,

6. Ne populum extrema] The arena was
slelparated· from the scats, lvyltxiicll: w‘ent (found

self to appeal to the compassion of the peo-
ple, at whose request it usually was that he
got his freedom and the ‘ rudis? We learn
from Juvenal that the persons of highest
condition sat by the ‘ podium,' and to their
influence the appeal would be more imme-
diately made. He says (S. ii. 145) :—

“ Et Capitolinis generosior et Marcellis
Et Catulis Paulique minoribus et Fabiis
011111111115 ad podium spectantibus?

Lipsius (de Amphith. 6. xi.) supposes that
there was between the ‘ podium' and lowest
seat a level space, in which the principal
personages sat, the curule officers in their
own chairs. Veianius Horace says, retired
into the country to escape the temptation
to engage himself again, and to place
himself in the position he had so often
occupied of a suppliant for the people's
favour.

7. Est mihi puryatam] He has a voice
within him, 116 says, the office of which is
to whisper 111 his attentive ear the precept
that follows, the idea of which is taken
from Ennius, who takes it from the Circus.
His words in Cicero de Senect. (6. 5)
are,—

“ Sicut fortis equus spatio qui saepe su-
Vig’trenffiympia, nunc senio confectu’
quiescit.'’

The reverse of ‘ purgatam aurem,’ which
was a conventional expression, is found in
the next Epistle (v. 53), “auriculas col-
lecta sorde dolentes? [See S. i. 4. 8,
noge-{lia ducat] ‘Ilia trahere ’ or‘ducere ’

are ordinary expressions for panting: they

mean to contract the flanks, as is done in -

the act of recovering the breath. The re-
verse is ‘ilia tendere? See Virg. Georg-
iii. 506, “imaque longo Ilia singultu ten-
dunt.’' ‘Ilia ducere’ is here to become
broken winded. [Doederlein explains ‘ilia
ducere’ as equivalent to ‘ex ilibus spiritum
ducere.’]

10. et versus et cetera ludicra pono]
He did not keep his word, for he wrote
much of the fourth Book of odes and the
Carmen Saeculare after this. He says of
himself (Epp. ii. 1. 111) :—

“ Ipse ego qui nullos me affirmo seribere
versus

Iuvenior Parthis mendacior.”

‘ Ludicra ' means the follies of light poetry,
&ges-L- amours, as he says (Epp. ii. 2.

“ Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes,
Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum3
Tendunt extorquere poemata?

[Comp. Epp. ii. 2. 144-‘ Omnis in hoc
sum ι’ ‘ totus in illis‚’ S. i. 9. 2.]

13. quo lare tuter] This is equivalent
to ‘ qua in domo,’ respecting which see C.
i. 29. 14 n.; and as to ‘jurare in verba’
see note on Epod. xv. 4, “ 111 verba jurabas
mea.” The metaphor is taken from the
cath of the gladiator (‘auctoramentum')
(S. ii. 7. 59). Horace says he follows no
school and knows no master, but like a
traveller always changing his abode,
he follows the breeze that carries him
hither and thither, just as his temper hap-
pens 10 be or his judgment chauces to be
influenced ς “ tossed to and fro, and carried
about with every wind of doctrine‚'' as St.
Paul says, using the same sort of language.

16. Nunc ayilis fio] That is, he agrees
with the Stoioe, with whom “ the end of life
