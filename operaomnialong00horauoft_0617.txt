Si posset centum scenae praebere rogatus,

“ Qui possum tot ?” ait ς “ tamen et quaeram et quot habebo
Mittam :” post paulo scribit sibi millia quinque

Esse domi chlamydum; partem vel tolleret omnes.

Exilis domus est ubi non et multa supersunt
Et dominum fallunt et prosunt furibus.

Ergo,

Si res sola potest facere et servare beatum,
Hoc primus repetas opus, hoc postremus omittas.
Si fortunatum species et gratia praestat,

Mercemur servum qui dictet nomina, laevum

Plutarch says, were among the most noble.
From his extravagant works, by which he
lavelled hills and checked the waters of the
asam “narrassem
this anecdota, only giving a smaller num-
ber of purple cloaks, which Horace puts at
sssty times the number applied for, and Plu-
tarch, perhaps with more truth, if there is
any truth in the story, only doubles. The
story as Plutarch tells it is, that a praetor
who wished toget upa public spectacle on
nn ambitione salle, (φιλοτιμουμένου περὶ
θέας) applied to Lucullus to lend him some
purple cloaks for a chorus. Lucullus said
he would inquire, and if he had any he
would let him have them. The next day
he asked him how many he wanted, and
when the ‘praetor' said a hundred, Lu-
cullus hade him take twice that number.
‘Plutarch refersto Horace’s mention of the
story, and seems to think his comment
upon it, that a man to be rich ought to
know only a small part of his possessione,
is meant seriously. He gives that as Ho-
race’s opinion, whereas it is plain he is
only speaking ironieally.

The ‘chlamys’ was an upper ent
worn by the Greeks, a light sort of shawl
thrown loosely over the body in a variety
of ways, of which a specimen is seen in
the Belvedere Apollo. The Romans did
not wear it till the time of the empire‚
and it was never more than an occasional
- garment at Rome. Lucullus it seems had
brought with him a number of a
oostly kind from Asia, where they were
worn in the Greek cities. 'What the repre-
sentation may have been for which the
praetor wanted these ‘chlamydes' is not
certain, but Greek characters must have
been introduced.

50. Mer-cemm- servum] Tbere was a
class of slaves called ‘nomenclatores’ or
‘fartores' (crammers), ὀνοματολόγοι, whose

office it was to accompany their master
when walking, or attend him at home at
the honr of ‘salutatio’ (when, if he was
a person of consequence, people of au soi-ts
oeme ιο pay him their respecta), and to
remind him of the names and circum-
stances of his visitors, aud any thing else
that it might be necessary for the master
to remember. lf he was aiming at any
office, it was n to be polite tc the
citizens of all classes, and his ‘ nomencla-
tor‚' if he were elever, would be of good
service tc him in this matter. Horace's
advice to the man who thinks happiness de-
pends ou such things as show and popularity
(fspecioe et gratia ³), is, that he should buy
a elever ‘nomenclator' ιο go with him
through the streets, and nudge him when-
ever he oeme to any one of influence and
remind him ιο shake hands and say some-
thing civil ιο him, calling him affection-
ately ‘ my brother,’ ‘ my father,' according
to his age. This shows us that canvassing
and electioris still continued. [Kruger
observes that Horace's picture refers to
the time of the Republic‚ which may be
true, though canvassing and elections
were not quite at an end yet. Sueton.

‘Nomenclatores’ were also employed to
explain ιο the guests the names and qua·
lities of the dishes, and para-sites some-
times took this office upon themselves (S.
ii. 8). In Pliny's time the number of
slaves in a household was such that it was
ssffiffisszzmfflfflss (Ϋὲἐῖ
l): “Hoc profecere mancipiorum legiones,
et in domo turba externa, ac servorum
quoque eausa nomenclator adhibendus?
Women also had servants of this class, as
we read in Suetonius of a woman's slave,
‘ nomenclator,' having formed a desigu on
Augustus (Aug. c. 19). Womenhad their
throng of courtiers as the men had.
