HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN XIII.

The same remark applies to this ode as to many others, that those who believe it to
have reference to real persons, and the jealousy to be any thing but 0 poetical jealousy,
have mistaken the character of Horace's writings. It would be difficult to imagine the
man who wrote these verses really jealous while he was writing them, or much acquainted
with that passion. The ode is too slight for us to judge whether it was taken from a.
Greek original ; but the expression in v. 16 shows that Greek ideas were runningin the
writer's head, which may be said, Ι feel satisfied, of almost every one of his amatory

compositions.

ARGUM ENT.

Lydia, while thou art praising Telephus' neck, Telephus’ arms, oh! my heart is ready to
burst. My mind tosses about, my colour comcs and goes3 and the tear stealing down
my cheek tells of the slow fire that burns within. It galls me when his rough hands
hurt thy shoulders, or his teeth leave their mark on thy lips: think not he will be
constant who could hurt that nectared mouth. How happy they whom love binde

fast to the day of their death!

CUM tu, Lydia, Telephi
Cervieem roseam, cerea Telephi
Laudas brachia, vae meum
Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur.
Tum nec mens mihi nec color 5
Certa sede manet, humor et in genas
Furtim labitur arguens
Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
Uror, seu tibi candidos

Turparunt humeros immodicae mero
Rixae sive puer furens

10

Impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audias,
Speres perpetuum dulcia barbare

2. cerea Telephi] For ‘ cerea‚' Bentley
on the authority of Flavius Caper, one
of the old grammarians who misquotes
this passage, substitutos ‘lactea-³ He
is very well answered by Cunningham.
That reading however shows the sense in
which Caper quoting from memory under-
stood ‘eerea,' ‘white as wax,' not [as it
ought to be understood] ‘ soft,’ ‘pliant.’

6. manet] The MSS. vary between
this and ‘manem' Ven„ 1483, has ‘ma-
net.' So also has the oldest Berne MS. of
Orelli, and many others. Cruquius’ Blan-
dinian MSS. had all ‘manent.’ There is
more probability of ‘manent’ having been
substituted on account of the metre for
‘manet‚' than ‘manet’ for ‘ manent ;’ but
the lengthening of 0 short syllable in such
positions is not uncommon. So C. ii. 13. 16:

“ Caeca timet aliunde fata..” Bentley lays
down the mle, and Zumpt appi-oves it, that
two substantives in the singular number
coupled by ‘ nee’ and ‘nec’ have the verb
in the singular, which he says usage and
reason demand. I do not 000 the reason in
the case of disjunctive any more than of
conjunctive particles, and to assume the
usage is to beg the question. [Madvig
quotes Cicero, de Fin. iii. 21, ‘ nec justitia
nec amicitia esse omnino potuerunt nisi
ipsae per se expetantur-⁹ Ritter: but the
reason of the plural being used here 10 ex-
plained by ‘ipsae . . . expetantur.’] That
the singular verb is admissible no one will
deny, and I have admitted it on good au·
thority. [Ritter 1100 · manent.’]

13. Non— Speres] This more empha-
tic negative (Key's L. G. 1402) is used
