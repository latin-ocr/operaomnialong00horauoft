‘Solidus' signifies that whichhasno vacant
part οι· space3 and hence ‘solidus dies’
comes to si gnify the business hours, or

fflpied part of the day. Juvenal says (xi.

 

J am nunc in bssnea salva
Fronte licet vadas, quamquam solida hora

supersit
Ad sextamss’

Senec- Ep. 84, “ Hodiernus dies solidus
est: nemo ex illo quicquam mihi eripuit-’¹
Stat. Silv. iv. 3. 36,—

“At nunc, quae solidum diem terebat,
Horarum via facta vix duarum.”

The ‘solidus dies' ended at the hour of
dinner, which with industrious persons
was the ninth in summer, and tenth in
winter. The luxurious dined earlier (as

“Exul ab octava Marius bibit‚'' Juv. i. 49),
the busy sometimes later. See Becker’s
Gallus, Exc. i. sc. 9, on the meals of the
Romans. The commencement of the day
varied with the habits of different people.

22. caput] This is used for the mouth,
as well as the spring osa river. Virg. Georg.
iv. 319, “ Tristis ad extremi sacrum capnt
astitit amnisss’ Caesar (B. G. iv. 10) says of
the Rhine, “ multis capitibus in Oceanum
influit.” Here it is the spring. Shrinae
were usually built at the fountain-head
of streams, dedicated to the nymphs that
protected them, which explains ‘ sacrae?

23. lituo tubae] The ‘lituus' was curved
in shape and sharp in tone, and used by the
cavalry: ‘tuba,’ as its name indicates, was
straight, and of deep tone, and used by the
infantry. “ Non tuba directi, non aeris cor-
nua flexi” (Ov. Met. i. 98). Lipsius de Mil.
Rom. says the ‘ lituus ’ was in shape a mean
between the ‘ tuba’ and the ‘ cornu ;’ not -
so straight as the one, nor so twisted as the
other. Aulus Gellius (N. A. i. 11) makes a
distinction between the three, but does not
explainwhatitis. Seec. ii. 1. 17.

24. Bellaque matribus Detestata] ‘-De
testatus’ is nowhere else used passively,
except by the law· writers, who use it for
one convicted by evidence (Dig.50.16.
238). ‘’Modulatus (C. i. 32. 5), ‘me-
tatus ' (ii. 15. 15),
