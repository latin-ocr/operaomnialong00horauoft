572 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE V.

As to Torquatus, the person whom Horace in this Epistle invites to dine with him,
see C. iv. 7, Introduction. The occasion was the evening before Caesar-'s birth-day
(v. 9), which Porphyrion says means C. Julius Caesar. His birth-daywas on the 12th
July, and this dinner was given in the summer (v. 11). But the name Caesar put
absolutely could only apply to Augustus at this time, and Comm. Cruq. differs from the
other Scholiast‚ and says rightly it must have been the birth-day of Augustus, which
was the 23rd of September. The expression ‘aestiva’ does not accurately correspond
to that time, for autumn began the day before the Ides of September. But that is not
very important. The heat is never so opproesive as in September in a warm climate.
The dinner was not given on the birth-day, but the night before, aud the holiday is
referred to because the man of business would have nothing to do next day, and might
lie in bed late and therefore sit up late. The Epistle contains a good-tempered invi·
tation to dinner, nothing more. It is the fashion with a good many of the commen-
tators to find out the characters of Horace’s friends from his Odes and Epistloe, and in
various parts of this they see allusions to the pride and avarice and parsimonious
tendeney of Torquatus, as well as his fondness for good living, just as from the last it
is discovered that Tibullus was of a morose and melancholy turn of mind, and given to
brooding over his misfortunes. This is mere triffing. [Ritter fixes the date of this
Epistle in the summer months of A.U.c. ⁹734, a few days after the birth of Caius Caesar,
as he calls him, the son of Agrippa and Julia‚ the daughter of Augustus. The birth
of this child was celebrated by making the day a perpetual festival (Dion Cassius 54.
c. 8). Ritter explains v. 9 thus: ‘ Cras dies festus erit ob natum nobis Caesarem?
Caius and Lucius, the sons of Agrippa and J ulia, were adopted into the Julian family
by Augustus (Tacit. Ann. i. 3) ς but Ritter has not proved that Caius Caesar was
adopted by Augustus as soon as he was born.]

of the old editions have ‘Archaicis,' it is
