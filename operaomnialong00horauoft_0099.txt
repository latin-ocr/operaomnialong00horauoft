though most even of those who divide the colloquy at v. 6 have overlooked this diffi-
culty, and accepted‘ te' on the authority of the MSS. But‘ nauta’ is not properly a
οοιιιιιιοιι mlor, but‘ navicularius,' a shipmaster. “Nautam accipere debemus eum qui
navem exercet· . quamvis nautae appellantur omnes qui navis navigandae causa in nave
sunt. Sed de exercitore solummodo Praetor sentit ’' (Dig.4 9. 1. 5 2). The ‘exercitor’
’u theparson who chartei-s the ship. There does not seem-to be any natural division at
v. 16, and for Archytas to begin (at v. 21) with ‘ Me quoque devexL’ dte„ nothing
having gone before with which to connect those words, is also nnnatura13 while, if we
undu-stand him tobegin his reply at ¹ Sed omnes una manet nox,’ we have an opposition
bettreen the sare-sm of the first speaker (who says irouieally of those that aspired to
connexion with the gods and to the highest order of wisdom that they had not escaped
death, not even Pythagoras, though he pretended to have done so once) and the grave
mth, solemnly propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, wise and unwioe, old
and young, on laudor atsea, and illustrate-1 byhisown case. This was once my
opinion. and ts many will still adhere to the theory of the dialogue and Archytas' ship-
wreck, 1 have put that theory in what appears to me the best form. The other expla-
nationes the ode, however, Ι feel little doubt, is in the main the true one. Another, to
which Orelli inclined (though he suspended his judgment on the whole question), sup-
ponoe a aanor coasting along the Apulian shore and seeing the tomb of Archytas, where-
npon he breaks out into the addi-ess ⁸ Te maris,’ be„ from v. 1 to 20. 'rhen the ghost
of ι lately shipwrecked man comes forward and prays for a little sand- It would be
difficolt to imagine any circumstances that could have suggested such a soene, especially
with so abrupt a change of persons. The sudden apparition of a ghost echoing back to
the mariner at sea his own words tn my mind appears almost ludicrous.

One difficulty appears to me to be fatal to the notion of a dialogue, and that is con-
tained in the second and third verses, in which it appears to be clearly intimated that
tho body of Archytas has already received that which he is supposed so earnestly to
ιιι, for z fou· though many, 1 am aware, get over this difficulty by supposing ‘ cohibent
vmunera’ to mean that the want ‘ff the scanty gifl: of a little earth was keeping him

‘cohibent’ with Dillenbr. and others, as if it was meant that his body occupied but a
small spaeeon the surfaoe of the ground. The wordsean only mean that he was under
the saud, whether partially or otherwise, and in either ease he would not require dust
to he east three times on him.

Thisoonsiderafion, as well as the unity and simplicity it gives to the ode, has induced
ne, with much eonfidenee, to adopt the explanation 1 have given. The propriety of a

ARGUMENT.

Bven thee, thou measnrer of earth and sea, thou counter of the sands, Archytas, how
anull a portion of earth contains thee now! It profits thee not to have searched the
air and traversed the hffivens since thou wert to die. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and
Minos have died. and Pythagoras too with all his learning bath gone down once more
to the grave. But so it is : all must die alike ς some to make sport for Mars, some
mllowed up in the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave: none escape z I
toohave perished in the waters. But grudge me not, thou mariner, a handful of
earth: so may the stan-m spend itself on the woods while thou art safe and thy mer-
chandize inex-esses. Is it a small matter with thee to bring ruin on thy children Ξ*
Yea, perhaps retribution awaits thyself ε my curses will be heard, and then no atoue-
ment shall deliver thee. ’Tis but the work of a moment—thrice castarth upon me
and hasten on.
