when a man was indulging in that way
himself (A. P. 210). This explains the
expressions “ genio indulgere ” (Persius v.
151), “genium suum defraudare ’³ (Terence,
Phorm. i. 1. 10), “genium curare ” (C. iii.
17. 14). Women had their genii, but they
were named J unones; “ Quamobrem ma-
jor caelitum populus quam hominum
intelligi potest: cum singuli quoque ex
semetipsis totidem deos faciunt, J unones
Geniosque adoptando sibi’' (Plin. H. N.
ii. 7). The representations of genii on
medals correspond to attributes supposed
or real of the persons they belong to.
There is a medal representing the genius
of Nero with a ‘ patera' in one hand, and
a ‘ cornucopia' in the other, and an altar
kindled before him to show the piety of

(Oisel. Thes. Pl. 42. 5). A medal of the
empress J ulia Mammaea represents her
with the symbol of Hope in one hand and
of Virtue in the other, to show how the
hopes and strength of the empire rested
on her.

former passage.

EPISTLE VIII.
ΔΑΜ). 734.

Respecting the person to whom this Epistle was written, and the occasion, see Ep. 3
of this book, Introduction, and note on v. 15. Horace it appears was not iu very good
humour with himself when he wrote it. He describes himself as suffering less from
bodily than mental weakness, irritability, sluggishness, perverseness, and caprice. He
may use rather stronger language than was necessary, but there can be no doubt he
felt a good deal of what he says that he felt. It shows that a man may give good advice ¹
to his friends which he cannot steadily apply to himself, and it helps us to understand
the character of Horace and his philosophical aspiratione described, probably about this
time, in his Epistle to Maecenas (i. 1). The critics find fault with this Epistle as if it
were written in an unkind spirit towards Celsus, which I do not understand. The
counsel in the last verse does not imply this. It is advice such as a young man lately
promoted to an important office might be glad of ,- and if the manner seems abrupt to
ue, it was nothing at that time probably between friends of whom one was young
enough perhaps to be the other’s son.
