manyMSS. 1 see no occasion with Bent-
ley and others for supposing Priscus to

” ” lave been in the habit of going backwards

and forwards to Athens. He put on first
one character and then another: now a
man about town, and now talking of
going to Athens as a philosopher. He
was just such nn unstable person as 'rigel-
lius isdescribed tobein S.i.3.18: “Nil
fuit unquam Sic impar sibi.’' He was
“ every thing by turns and nothing
long.'' [inaequalis—ut: Epod. xvi. 31.11.]

14 Vertumnis, quotquot saint, uatus
iniq-is] Vertumnus was the god who
represented change. Priscus was born
when Vertumnus was angry (S. 3. 8 11.,
paries dis atque poetis ”),
and Horace sta-engthens it by saying all
the·Vertumni; as if every image of the
god were a separate divinity, and all were

when this fickle man was born.
15. Scurra rozam-in] He had the

gont, which Horace says he richly de-
sei-ved, and was so given to gambling
(C. iii. 24. 58 n.), that when he could not
handle the dice-box himself, he hired a
boy to do it for him. ‘ I’himus’ was the
Greek word for what the Romans called
‘fritillum’ From the shape it was also
called ‘turricula’ or ‘pyrgus' (πύργος),
and that word appears in the text of the
Scholiasts and in many of the old editions
for ‘ phimum! As to ‘ talos: see S. 3. 171
n. They were sometimes throwu with the
[‘ Cheragra' the reading of a few
MSS. Ritter observes that ‘ cheragra'
has the first short, and ‘chiragra' has
the first long. He refers to Bentley, who
only says that ‘ chiragra ’ ought to have
the first long, which is true, if the Romans
intended to represent χειράγρα, Persius
(S. v. 58) has ‘ lapidosa chiragra fregerit
articulos.’] ’

19. levius miser ac prior illo] ‘ Levius
miser,’ ‘less miserable,’ is an unusual ex-
pression. The MSS. and editions vary
between ‘illo’ and ‘ ine? Bentley and
many others before and after him have
‘ ine? ‘ Illo ' gives the simpler construc-
tion. ‘ Prior illo’ means superior to that
man who is always chauging his character,
one moment appearing strict, another
loose, in his principles and conduct. The
superiority of the man who is consistent
in vice lios in his indifl'erence to virtue,
and the quietness of his conscience arising
from that cause. In that sense he is
better off, and less miserable than the
other. Some MSS. have ‘ acrior illo.'

21. Non dices hodie] ‘ Hodie’ is equi·
valent to ‘ statim: ‘ this moment.' *Deer-
ing iuterprets ‘ this day of the Saturnalia‚’
which destroys the force of the word alto-
gether. ‘ Furcifer’ is explained by Dona-
tus on Terence (Andr. iii. 5. 122 ‘¹ Tibi ut
