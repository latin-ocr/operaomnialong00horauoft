6. An Medda laudas] Lysimachus,
aster the battle of Ipsus (13.c. 301), when
,hc became master of the western part of
Asia Minor, destroyed the towns of Lebe-
dus and Colophon in Ionia, and transferred
the inlubitants to Ephesus. Lebedus never
menis to have been rebuilt so as to recover
any of its former importance, and the ruins
of the old town probably helped to make the
desolate appearance described by Horace.
Some ruins still in existence, marking the

knew Lebedus, but did not know the other
places he has referred to. He must have
seen this place, if at all, in his campaign
with Brutus.

Gabii was an ancient town of Latium,
an Alban colony, 100 stadia from Rome,
which excavations, made about the end
of the last century, show to have stood
near-the small lake, now mlled Pantano.
Duringthe civil wars it fell into ruins3 so
that Lucan says,

“ —- Gabios, Veiosque, Coramque

Pulvere vix tectae poterunt monstrare rui-
nae ’' (vii. 392).

Propertius mentium its desertion and for-
mer greatness in one line (iv. 1. 34),—

“ Et qui nunc nulli mxima turba Gabi.”

Juvenal mentions it as a place of resort
{canpeople in hnmble circumstances (iii.

“ Quis timet aut timuit gelida Praeneste
Aut positiffixemorosn inter juga Volsiniis,
Siniglicibus Gabiis ἲ ”

“ - quum jam celebres notique poetae

Balneolum Gabiis, Romae conducere furnos

Tentaoent '’ (vii. 3).

In Horace's time, while cold bathing was
the fashion under the advice of Antonius
Musa, Gabii was resorted to. Horace may
have been there himself (Ep. 15. 9). The
town was restored under the Emperors
Antoninus and Commodus. There was a
temple of Juno at Gabii, of which some
remains are said to exist. Several statues
and inscriptions were found when the ex·
mvations were made.

Fidenae was about five miles from Rome,
cn the Via Salaria, at a place now named
Castel Giubileo. In mac. 329 the town
was destroyed by Aemilius Mamercus (Liv.
iv. 9). Previous to this it had been one of the
most troublesome of the Roman possessionis,
making many efforts to recover its inde·
pendence. According to tradition Romulus
found it a large town and conquered it
(Dionys. Halic. ii. 53), but it seems never
to have risen to any great importance again.
Tacitus (Anu. iv. 62) describes a dread·
ful accident which happened at Fidenae,
and πω caused by the falling of a tempo·
rary amphitheatre‚ by which he says 5o,000
persons were killed or hurt ; but they had
come from all quartem, and this is no indi·
cation of the population. Suetonius (Tib. ”
40) makoe the number upwards of 20‚000.

These two towns are mentioned by J u-
venal (S. x. 99),—

“Hujus-qui trahitur praetextam sumere
Αῐιῖἒὶἓέυιι-ηω Gabiorumque ease potes-

that is, a magistrate of the little towns of
Fidenae and Gabii; and S. vi. 56 2—-

“ —— vivat Gabiis nt vixit in ς
Vivat Fidenis, et agello cedo paterno? γ
