HORATII FLACCI

Rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et umbra :
Tu me inter strepitus nocturnos atque diurnos

Vis canere et contracta sequi vestigia vatum ‘?

'80

Ingenium sibi quod vacuas desumpsit Athenas,
Et studiis annos septem dedit insenuitque

Libris et curis, statua taciturnius exit

Plerumque et risu populum quatit 3 hic ego rerum

Fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis

Verba lyrae motura sonum connectere digner?
Frater erat Romae consulti rhetor, ut alter
Alterius sermone meros audiret honores,
Gracchus ut hic illi, foret huic ut Mucius ille.

Anxietate carens animus facit, omnis
acerbi

Impatiens, cupidus silvarum, aptusque
bibendis ·

Fontibus Aonidum.'’

[There is a reading ‘urbes,’ which Ritter
has. ‘Urbem’ means Rome.]

80. eontracta sequi vestiqia] Some of
the best MSS. have ‘contactas which
Comm. Cruq. reading interprete “hoc est
vis me aliena. dicere: nam contacta pro
detritis·r t divulgatis dixit ;·et ita vis me
scribere ut ad vates antiquos accedam
proxime? It is not easy to get all this
out of ¹ contacta.’ Ι think the other is the
true reading, and that it means that the
road to fame is not what we calla royal
road ς that the poets walk in a path nar·
rowed by fixed rules; and that it requires
thought and diligenee to tread in their
steps, as Propertius says (iii. 1. 14) : “Non
datur ad Musas currere lata via.” Bentley,
with no authority, substitutos, ‘non tacta?

81. vacuas desumpsit Athenas] See Epp.
i. 7. 45 n. for ‘vacuas.’ Horace says the
man who has retired to stndy, as he had
done at Athens, and has shut himself up
for several years, and grown dull over his
books and his meditatione, cannot open
his lips when he comes to Rome, and is
only laughed at by the people for 1118 so-
briety. This is an odd defence for one who
had written so much as he had done at
Rome. It is meant for 8 j'oke. ‘Septem
annos’ is not to be taken litei-any, as if
Horace had been seven years at Athens,
which is very improbable. He was only

twenty-two when he joined Brutus, A.U.c. ,

71ἒὲ3. statua taeitwrnius] Comp. S. ii.

53'3] Frater erat Romae] who these

brothers were Horace does not tell us, and
it does not matter. One was ajuriseon-
sultus (S. i. 1. 9 11.) and the other a teacher
of rhetoric. The lawyer said the rhetorieiau
was a perfect Gracchus for eloquence, and
he returned the compliment by declax-ing
that his brother was 8 second Scaevola for
legal learning. And this sort of mutual
flattery goes on Horace says among poets‚
and he cannot keep pace with their ion
for praise. Tiberius Gracchus and his
brother Caius were both in Cieero’s opinion
great orators. We need not therefore
attempt to decide to which of them Horace
alludes. Q. Mucius Scaevola the augur,
son-in-law of C. Laelius, and an early in·
structor of Cicero (Lael. 8. 1), was learned
in the law 3 but his namesake and younger
contemporary, the Pontifex Maximus, was
more celebrated still. Cicero (de Orat.
i. 39) calls him ‘⁴ homo omnium et disci-
plina juris civilis eruditissimus et ingenio
prudentiaque acutissimus, et oratione max-
ime limatus atque subtilis, atque ut ego
soleo dicere juris peritorum eloquentissi-
mus. eloquentium juris peritissimus.” This
name therefore, like that of Gracchus for
oratory, stands for a consummate jurist.
[Cicero may allude to P. Mucius Scaevola,
consul 13.c. 133.]

[— ut alter] Kriiger compares ‘dives
ut metiretur nummos ' (S. i. 1. 95 n.) with
‘ Frater erat . . . ut,' and there is no ,
other explanation: ‘ an orator 8 brother of a
lawyer, and so brotherly that each in the
other's talk received nothing but eompli-
ments? ‘ Frater’ in fact in this confused
construction serves two ραι-110888]

88. meros audiret honores] Compare
(Epp. i. 7. 84) “vineta crepat mera.”

89. foret haic ut Mucius ille] There
does not appear to be any extant MS. with
this reading. Fea mentions two editions
