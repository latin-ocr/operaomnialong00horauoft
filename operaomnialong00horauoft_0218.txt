HORATII FLACCI

Late conspicuum tollere verticem,

Maecenas, equitum decus.

Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,

Ab dis plura feret : nil cupientium

Nudus castra peto et transfuga divitum
Partes linquere gestio,

Contemptae dominus splendidior re’1',

Quam si quidquid arat impiger Apulus

Occultare meis dicerer horreis,
Magnas inter opes inops.

Purae rivus aquae silvaque jugerum

Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae

Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae

Fallit sorte beatior.

21. Quanto quisque sibi] This senti-
ment approaches as near as possible to the
fundamental rule of Christian ethics. The
accuracy of the picture in the next verses
must not be insisted on too closely. It
would imply that Horace, a wealthy Epi-
curean, had thrown up his riches in con-
tempt, and gone over to the ranks of the
Stoics, as Cicero says (ad Fam. ix. 20), “in
Epicuri nos adversarii nostri castra con-
jecimus. '’ But, as Horace never was rich,
118 never could have acted the (18881181- 011
these terms, though 118 changed his opi-
nions He may sometimes be supposed
(C. ii. 6, Introduction) to put general
maxims in the first person without strict
application to himself. ‘ N udus' signifies
one who has left every thing he had behind
him. ‘Contemptae' Bentley supposes to
mean that for which Horace had a con-
tempt. But he means that the rich man
with fine houses had a contempt for his
little property.

26. arat impiger] To avoid the length-
ening of the final syllable in ‘ arat? some
editions, supported by a few MSS. (pauci
codices, ut e meis Alt. 1. Lips. 3.—JAN1)
have ‘ non piger? But the licence may be
admitted in the caesura] place, and the
MSS. authority is in favour of ‘ impiger?
[‘ Quidquid arat‚’ ‘ whatever he gains by
the plough :' something like Sallust’s
‘ quae homines arant, navigant, aedificant‚'
‘what men do in ploughing, navigating
ships, and building‚’ Cat. c. 2.] ‘Occultaress
‘to hoa1·d‚' which was commonly done to
raise the price. ‘Meis’ is emphatic, as
‘ proprio horreo' (C. i. 9).

29. Parae rivus aquae] Horace 1111111188>
to the small river Digentia. On '‘certa
fides' see 0.· ιίἰ. 1. 30 11. ‘Fallit beatior' is
a Greek construction, λανθάνει ὀλβιώτερον
ὄν. Propertius has (i. 4. 15):

“Quo magis et nostros contendis solvere
⁴amores,

Hoc magis adducta fallit uterque flde.”

‘ The more you try to loosen our affection,
the more we each of us, im tibly to
you, interchan ge the amrmce of fidelity'
Lucan also (vi.g 64. 68) has the same con-
struction twice·

“Prima quidem surgens operum structura

Pffiffiliaeiitum, veluti—

Unda ‚Paledonios fallit turbata Britan-
nos.

Horace says, ‘Mine is a happier lot than
his who has all Africa for his possession,
though he knows not that it is so? Bent-
ley interpr-ets ‘imperio’ and ‘sorte’ with
reference to the proconsul 3 ‘ ntem'
118 changes to ‘fulgente' and ‘fallit’ he
understands ‘ absolute! Porphyrion inter-
prets ffulgentem’ 818. rightly: “Qui sibi
clarus videtur quia latissimas multasque
habet inAfrica possessiones. ” [Ritter also
supposes that‘ Africae sors’ is the p-rocon
sular government of the province pAfrica,
and he compares Tacitus, Anu. iii. 58, ¹71,

‘sors Asiae? His translation is ‘and my
crop’ s certainty how it is richer than
Africa' s productive province he sees not
who is resplendent with proconsular power!
He takes‘ fulgentem imperio’ absolutely3
but we must connect with it‘ fertilis Afri-
cae, 'which 1s also connected with ‘sorte '
The passage is difficult. 1 think Mac-

leane' s interpretation is better. ‘Fulgen-
