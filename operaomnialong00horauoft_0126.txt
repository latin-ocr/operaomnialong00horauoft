HORATII FLACCI

NULLUS argento color est avaris
Abdito terris, inimice lamnae
Crispe Sallusti, nisi temperato

Splendeat usu.

Vivet extento Proculeius aevo 5
Notus in fratres animi paterni3
Illum aget penna metuente solvi

Fama superstes.

Latius regnes avidum domando

Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis

10

Gadibus jungas et uterque Poenus

Serviat uni.

Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops,

2. Abdito terris] Lambinus' conjecture
‘ abditae terris ' to agree with ‘lamnae ’ has
’ been adopted by many editors, but it has
no MS. authority. I see no other great
objection to it. ‘ Avaris ' Doering under-
stands to be the dative case, ⁶ hidden by the
avaricious in the earth3' as S. i. 1. 41 ι

“ Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus
et auri
Furtim defossa timidum deponere terra ⁸?''

But, besides the confusion this introduce-s
in the construction, the force ofsthe allusion

· is thus lost. Sallustius possessed some valu-

able mines in the Alps, and to this circum-
stance Horace seems tacitly to refer. The
character given of Sallustius by Tacitus
(Ann. iii. 30) is rather different from
Horace's description. Tacitus says he was
“ diversus a veterum instituto per cultum
et munditias, copiaque et affluentia luxu
propior :'' on the strength of which some
commentators have supposed Horace meant
to give him a hint upon his extravagance,
for which impertinence the great man
would not have thanked him. To bear
out their case they refer ‘ nisi temperato'
to the first line. Horace inverts the order
of the cognomen and gentilician name, as
Tacitus ‘frequently does 3 as ‘Agrippam
Postumum’ (Ann. i. 3), and elsewhere.
The eleventh ode of this book is addressed
to Quintius Hirpinus3 and the names are

inverted as here.
lamnae] Ovid (Fast. i. 207):

‘¹ J ura dabat populis posito modo praetor
Etaigsisoargenti lamina crimen erat.”

For examples of syncope see i. 36. 8 n.
5. Vivet exte-nto Proculeius aevo] Pro-
culeius is stated by the Scholiasts to have

assisted his brothers Caepio and Murena, ι
who had lost their property in the civil
warS. Scipio, as the name appears in Ascen-
sius’ text of the Scholhasts, is a mist-,ake for
Caepio. But it is doubtful whether Caepio,
whose family name was Fannius, was any
relation of Licinius Murena whose con-
spiracy he joined (see Introduction), or
whether Murena was Proculeius' brother
or cousin. Proculeius was in great favour
with Augustus and was intimate with
Maecenas (who married his sister or cousin
Terentia), and probably with Sallustius.
He was alive at this time, and did not die
till after Horace3 therefore the reading
‘agia’ which is that of some MSS„ is re-
jected by most editors. Proculeius was
like Maecenas a favourer of letters, and is
so referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 94):
“ Quis tibi Maecenas, quis nunc erit aut
Proculeius aut Fabius ?”

6. Notus—animi] Horace's adaptation
of Greek constructions is one of the chief
features of his style. [The sense is ‘ animi
paterni in fratres.'] He uses ‘metuente’
here in the same sense as in C. iv. 5. 20,
“ Culpari metuit Fides? Here it means
‘ wings that refuse to melt,’ as Icarus' did.
[Keller and Ritter have ‘pinna.’]

11. uterque Poenus] This means (as the
Scholiasts explain) the Carthaginians of
Africa and their colonies in Spain, not the
Phoenicians as Graevius says. ‘Uterque
pontus' has been suggested by Schrader,
because there were not two Poeni. But
the above explanation is sufficient. [‘ Ga-
dibus’ (Cadiz) is named ‘remotis,’ which
means ‘separated’ by the sea from the
opposite continent of Libya. In C. ii. 3. 6,
‘ remoto gramiue‚’ and C. ii. 19, ‘in remo-
tis rupibus.']
