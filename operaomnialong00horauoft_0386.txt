350 HORATII FLACCI

Cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis, 25
Cur m amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum

Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius? Α1 tibi contra
Evenit, inquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.

Iracundior est paulo, minus aptus acutis

Naribus horum hominum3 rideri possit eo quod 30
Rusticius tonso toga defluit et male laicus

In pede calceus haeret: atest bonus ut melior vir

Non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus, at ingenium ingens

Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.

Denique te ipsum

Concute num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim 35

which Rutgersius had conjectured. He
quotes a MS. of Acron as having ‘provi-
deas,' which Fea found in two Vatican
MSS. The received texts of the Scholiasta
give ‘pervideas.’ The sense in which
‘ praevideas' is understood is that of ‘ prae-
tervidere‚’ παραβλέπειν, ‘to overlook,’ in
support of which the following verses of
Menander are quoted from Plutarch :—

-·r{ τάλλότριον, ὤνθρωπε βασκανώτατε,
κακὸν ὀξυδερκεῖς, τὸ δ’ ἴδιον παραβλέπεις ς

Β111 there is no authority for that use of
the word ‘ praevidere.' The reading of
nearly all the MSS. and editions, ‘pervi-
deas' gives the best sense, ‘ while you see
through your own faults as well as a blear-
eyed man might do.' Bentley would like
to read ‘cum tua tu videas,’-a very un-
fortunate suggestion. He also changes
‘mala’ into ‘ male,’ upon little authority,
81111 11181 construction occurs often enough
in this Satire. The MSS. and editions are
nearly unanimous in reading ‘ mala.’ Fea.
mentions ‘pervideas mala’ as the reading
of Hildebert at the end of the eleventh
century. (Mor. Phil. Oper. 996). [Ritter
has ‘per videas‚' with this remark ι “ Cor-
rexi per videas, quo facto ‘ tua per 111818 ’
8 regione posita sunt proximis ’111 amico-
rum vitiis? '’ Doederlein compares ‘ pervi-
dere' with ’ perfidus,’
fuga‚' ‘ perdere,'
‘ pervideas’ by ‘ overlook‚' which is a better
explanation. See Key's Philological Essays‚

27. serpens Epidaurius] The serpente
of Epidaurus (on the Sinus Saronicus) were
proverbial, in consequence of Aesculapius
having been conveyed from that place,
whereg above others he was worshipped, to
Rome, in the form of 8 serpent, to avert a
pestilence. (Liv. x. 47. Epit. xi. [ς 81111
Ovid, Met. 622 -744] .)

29. Iraeundior est paulo] Horace is
illustrating here the tendency of those
quick-sighted critics of their neighbours’
characters to magnify the faults they find.
The first instance is of a man who is sensi-
tive under (not suited for) the sharp 311118-
1118111 of the men of that day (⁴horum
hominum ⁵), men who had the keenness of

and no delicacy in proclaimin them. 8ο

88110118818. Ι11 respect to the next instance
of a person of slovenly habits, Acron says
“hic dicitur pulsare Virgilium qui inde-
cori corporis et habitus fuitss’ He had no
doubt met with that statement, which is
repeated by Cruquius’ Scholiast, but how

much relianee 18 to be placed upon it ean- Δ

ports it. Madvig (Opuse. p. 60) rejects it.

‘Rusticius' belongs 10’,’101180 81111 ’-118

belongs to ‘laxus.' (888 v. 45, and O. i.
17. 25 n.). To be slipshod (μείζω vose ποδὸς
ὑποδήματα φορεῖν, Theophr. Char. 4) has
always been the proverbial characteristic
of a sloven. “Nec vagus in laxa pes tibi
pelle natet ’³ (Ovid, A. A. i. 516). Ἀ1 ’ 18
repeated in the same way as here by Cicero,
111 his eighth letter to Caelius (Ad. Fam. 11.
15): ‘⁶ Puerum, inquis? At quaestorem,
at nobilem adolescentem, at omnium fere
exemplo.” In Verr. ii. 5. 1 ι ”81 881 bonus
imperator, at felix ;” ii. 3. 4: “at sermone,
at literis, at humanitate ejus delectamini.'’
[⁶ Iracundior est? A supposition is some-
times put in this form. ‘Suppose he is
too sensitive.’ Compare v. 49, ‘Parcius
hic vivit ε’ ‘suppose he lives rather fru-

Compare C. i. 28. 38, ’81118811 ‘s‚’ &c.]

derived from the shakiug of 8 cloak, or any
thing of that sort, to see if there is any
