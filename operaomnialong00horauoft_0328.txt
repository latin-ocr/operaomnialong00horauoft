292 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN VII.

This ode is referred by Franke, Kirchner (p. 22), Mitscherlich‚ and others, to Amic.
722, when the last war between Caesar Octavianus and M. Antonius broke out. Orelli
refers it to the beginning of the war of Perusia, A 030. '713-14, to which period Epode
xvi. belongs. Dillenbr. refers it, without assigning any particular reasons, to the
year 716, when Augustus was going against Sex. Pompeius. There is very little, if any,

intel-nal evidence as to the date. None of the chronologists give any good reason for
their opinions, and the reader must judge for himself. [Ritter maintains that this ode

refers to the war which was terminated by the battle of Philippi, in which Horace was
(Epp. ii. 2. 46). This is the opinion of Acron. Ritter thinks that Epode xvi. refers to
Philippi, and also Epode xiii. ‘ Omnes hos versus inter belli paratus et ardorem factos

esse argumentum ipsorum docet: sed poeta patriae redditus polivisse et mitigasse
videtur quaecumque in strepitu armorum et partium studio concitatius composuerat.']

ARGUMENT.

Whither run ye to arms P—hath not blood enough of Romans been shed Ρ ’Tis not to
burn the walls of Carthage‚ or humble the Briton, but that the Parthian may rejoice
in seeing Rome fall by her own hand. The beasts do not war upon their kind. Is it
madness, or force irresistible, or wickedness that drives you? They are dumb ι they
answer not. 'Tis even so z the blood of Remus is visited on the destinies of Rome.

QUO, quo scelesti ruitis? aut cur dexteris
Aptantur enses conditi?

Parumne campis atque Neptuno super
Fusum est Latini sanguinis,

Non ut superbas invidae Karthaginis 5
Romanus arces ureret,

Intactus aut Britannus ut descenderet

’7. Intactas] See C. iii. 24. 1. What
Horace means to say is, “the blood that
has been spilt in these civil wars has been
shed not for the destruction of Carthage, as
in the war that Scipio led, or that the
Briton might be led in chains, as he was by
C. Julius Caesar, but for the destruction
of Rome herself.'’ ‘ Intactus' means ‘ un-
touched’ till Caesar invaded Britain and
carried away prisoners, many of whom
walked in his triumph. The first time
aster Caesar that a Roman army invaded
Britain was in the expedition of Claudius,

ing to the account given in that note) at
the Porta Triumphalis at the foot of the
Mons Capitolinus on the north, and passed
out of that gate into the Campus Martius,

tered the city again by the Porta Carmen-
talis, at the south extremity of the Mons
Capitolinus, where it entered the Vela-
brum, the space between that hill and
Mons Aventinus. Crossing the Velabrum
it passed by the Circus Maximus, which
lay between the last-named hill and Mons
Palatinus, round which it wound to the
left till it reached the spot where after-
wards was built the arch of Constantine,
on the eastern side, opposite the spot where
Vespasian built the Amphitheatre that bore
his name, Amphitheam-um Flavianum, or,
as it is now usually called, the Colosseum.
Keeping still tn the lefl: the processioa
came to the Templum Veneris, adjoining
which was the Templum Romai- Here
the Via Sacra commenced and continued
past the Templum Pacis, near to which
stands the Church of Sta. Maria Maggiore.
