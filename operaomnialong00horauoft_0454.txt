HOBATII FLAcci

Arreptaque manu, “ Quid agis, dulcissime rerum ?''
“ Suaviter ut nunc est‚'' inquam, “ et cupio omnia quae vis.” ¹ 5

3. Accurrit] Some of the old editions
have ‘ occurrit,' which is much less forcible.

[4. dulcissime rerwm] ‘ Pulcherrime
rerum,’ Ovid, Her. iv. 125, and Met. viii.
49. The sense is not ‘Quid rerum.']

5. Suaviter ut mmo est] ‘Pretty well
as times go ς’ by which, as Orelli says, he
· means nothing at all, not caring what 110
answers, but annoyed at the forwardness
of his assailant. ‘Cupio omnia quae vis'
is a common formula of politeness.

6. Cum assectantur] There is a pause,
and they walk side by side a little way
perhaps, in silence. Horace sees the man
means to begin, and anticipates him (‘ oc-
cupat,’ Epp. i. 7. 66) with a civil question
tantamount to wishing him good morning,
by which however the other is not discon-
certed. “ Surely you know me: I’m a man
of letters ;'' at which Horace, who is too
good-natured to be a match for such a
fellow, is thrown off his guard and returns
him a polite answer. The man has gained
his advantage and goes on chattering about
nothing ς while Horace feels his weakness
and is driven to common-place expedients
for effecting his escape, at which his com-
panion no doubt laughs in his sleeve.
‘Numquid vis quin abeam Ρ ’ ‘is there any
thing else I can do for you before Ι go Ρ '
Prof. Key (L. G. 1183) quotes this phrase
from Terence (Ad. ii. 2. 39), and adds in a
note, “ This or a shorter form, ‘ numquid
vis P' was a civil mode of saying good·bye.”
[‘ Notis nos‚' says Heindorf, must be con-
nected with ‘Num quid vis ?’ as Acron
explains it: ‘ You must become acquainted
with me.’ But I prefer Orelli's interpre-
tation, which is the same as that given
above : ‘Vix aliter fieri potest quam ut tibi
jam aliquatenus notus sim? He adds as a

reason, ‘docti sumusf]

10. Dicere neseio quid puero] When
the Romans walked abroad even for a stroll
on the most ordinary occasions, they had
one or more slaves with them. They were
a particular class in-the ⁶ familia‚' and called
from their occupation ‘ pedisequi.'

11. O te, Bolane, cerebri felicem] The
meaning of ¹ cerebri’ is seen in the adjec-
tive ‘ cerebrosus' (S. i. 5. 21), and guided
by the words of Horace, no doubt, Comm.
Cruq. tells us that Bolanus was ὀξύχολος,
0110 who ‘ nullius ineptias ferebat‚’ put up
with no map’s nonsense,—a temper which,
under such circumstance& the amiable
Horace might very well envy. But he was
too well-bred to say what hc felt aloud.
Bolanus was a cognomen of one at least of
the families at Rome. Vettius Bolanus
was appointed governor of Britain in the
last year of N ero's reign (Tac. Ann. xv. 3).
It was derived from Bola, a town of the
Aequi.

14. Misere cupis, inquit, abia-e] Here

the man, feeling his power, puts on an the ·

familiarity of an intimate friend, and iu-
sists upon offering his services and attend-
ance, and this is better expressed by ‘ per-
sequar’ than ‘prosequar,' which however
has very good MS. authority, and Bentley
adopts it. The majority of MSS. appear
by Fea’s account to have ‘persequar,' which
means ‘ I will follow you to the end? In
regard to the arrangement, the editions
vary between ‘persequar hinc: quo nunc
iter est tibi Ρ ’ ‘ persequar: hinc quo nunc
iter est tibi?’ and ‘persequar hinc quo
nunc iter est tibi,' without a question.
It appears to me that the man asks a
ques-tion, and that Horace's reply is an
evasion.
