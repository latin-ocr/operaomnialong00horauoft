HORATII FLACCI

Et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor, 20
Dum sibi dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa

Pertulit adversis rerum immersabilis undis.

Sirenum voces et Circae pocula nosti3

Quae si cum sociis stultus cupidusque bibisset,

Sub domina meretrice fuisset turpis et excors, 25
Vixisset canis immundus vel amica luto sus.

Nos numerus sumus et fruges consumere nati,

Sponsi Penelopae, nebulones, Alcinoique

In cute curanda plus aequo operata juventus,

Cui pulchrum fuit in medios dormire dies et 3ο
Ad strepitum citharae cessatum ducere curam.

Ut jugulent homines surgunt de nocte latrones :

πορθος is frequently applied to Ulysses by
Homer. Cicero accounts for it in a letter
to Plancus (x. 13), in which he urges him
to follow up the victory of D. Brutus at
Mutina, and to crush M. Antonius: “ Qui
enim M. Antonium oppresserit is bellum

‚ confecerit. Itaque Homerus non Ajacem

nec Achillem (which is an over-sight) sed
Ulixem appellavit πτολίπορθον.” The first
three verses of the Odyssey are almost
translated in th'ese lines. ‘ immersabilis'
is like ἆβάπτιστος in Pindar (Pyth. ii. 80),
ἀβάπτιστός εἰμι, φελλὸς ὣς ὑπὲρ ἕρκος,
ἅλμας. Compare C. iv. 4. 65: “Merses
profundo, pulchrior evenit.''

23. Sirenum voces] Ulysses by the
direction of Circe eluded the charming
voice of the Sirens (Odyssey xii. 165 sqq.) 3
and Circe poisoned his companions and
changed them into swine (Od. x. 230).
The Sirens were as proverbial with the
ancients as with us. Martial calls them
(iii. 64),—

“ Sirenas hilarem navigantium poenam,

Blandasque mortes, gaudiumque crudele,

Quas nemo quondam deserebat auditas.'’

27. Nos numerus sumus] This expres-
sion is not uncommon in the Greek tra-
gediam. In Aristophanes (Nub. 1201)
Strepsiades breaks out thus:

εὖ γ’, ὦ κακοδαίμονες, τί κάθησθ’ ἀβέλτεροι,

ἡμέτερα κέρδη τῶν σοφῶν, ὄντες λίθοι,

ἇριθριός, πρόβατ’, ἄλλως ἀμφορῆς νενησ-
μενοι 3

It means a mere undistinguished heap, and
‘fruges consumere nati ' is an adaptation
of Homer's οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν ἔδουσι (Il. vi.
142). ‘ Nos’ means the common sort of
men, among whom Horace places himself,

and all but the sage, who is like Ulysses‚
while the rest are no better than his wife’s
suitors, gluttons, wine-drinkers, and lazy ς
οι· the subjects oi’Alcinous‚ king of Phae-
acia, the host of Ulysses, to whom he
relates his adventures (Odyss. ix. sqq.).
The king describes his people thus :—

αἷεὶ δ’ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη, κίθαρίς τε, χόροι
εἵμῗτῖά τ’ ἐξημοιβά, λοετρά τε θερμά, καὶ
εὐναί. (Odyss. viii. 248.)

The Phaeacians were proverbial for
living. See Epp. i. 15. 24: “Pinguis ut
inde domum possim Phaeaxque. reverti.’'
Comm. Cruq. and some editors take Alcinoi
for the plural number. It is better to take
it as the genitive singular. On ‘cute
curanda,’ see S. ii. 5. 38 n.

31. cessatum ducere cumam] ‘Ducere,’
as a verb of motion, takes the accusative
of this verbal substantive to denote the
object, just as ‘venio' and ‘mitto’ do,
“This accusative of the verbal in ‘tu’ is
often called the supine active, and the
ablative of the same the supine passive ς
but there is nothing passive in the latter,
and therefore the distinction is inappre-
priate ’³ (Key's L. G. 1299, note). ‘Pactu’
is ‘ in the doing? aa ‘factum’ is ‘to the
doing ;’ so neither is passive. The Blan-
dinian MSS. had “cessatum ducere som-
num,'' which means nothing at all ς but
out of it Bentley has conjectured and
adopted into his text “cessantem ducere
somnum.” In the next line he reads
‘hominem’ for ‘homines,' the reading of
all previous editions, and “Manuscriptorum
pag), {01:55 majt01]·‚”sac·cogdi?t,ig to Fea.
