GARMEN XXVII.

Porphyrion calls this ode “ προτρεπτικὴ ad hilaritatem cujus sensus sumptus est ex
Anacreonte in libro tertio‚'’ and Comm. Cruq. quotes the words of Anacreon which are
these :—

ἄγε δηῦτε μηκέθ’ οὕτω

πατάγῳ τε κᾶλαλήτφ

Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οἴνῳ

μελετῶμεν, ἀλλὰ καλοῖς

ὑποπίνοντες ἐν ὕμνοις. (Fr. 63 Bergk.)

(Ι suppose δηῦτε is meant by Bergk for δὴ αὖτε. But I need not stop to discuss his
Greek, in which he is not always happy. δεῦτε is an obvious correction.) Whethser the
remainder of the poem furnished any other of the ideas in Horace’s ode, or whether he
got his scene from life, we cannot tell. Nothing can surpass the good temper and
dramatic ease that runs through the ode.

ARGUMENT.

Let barbarous Thraciam fight over their wine—stop your unhallowed noim, my friends,
and each lie quietly on his couch. What, am Ι to join you Ρ Then let that boy tell
me who has got his heart. Will he not? Then Ι drink not. Whoever it is, thou
hast no cause to be ashamed. Here whisper it in my ean—Ah ! poor boy, what a

Charybdis hast thou got into! What witch, what god shall deliver thee 1> Pegasus
himself could not do it.
