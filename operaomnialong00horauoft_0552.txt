HORATII FLACCI

Thesauro invento qui mercenarius agrum

Illum ipsum mercatus aravit, dives amico

Hercule 1' si quod adest gratum juvat, hac prece te oro,
Pingue pecus domino facias et cetera praeter

Ingenium, utque soles custos mihi maximus adsis.

15

Ergo ubi me in montes et in arcem ex urbe removi,
Quid prius illustrem satiris musaque pedestri?
Nec mala me ambitio perdit nec plumbeus Auster

12. amieo Hercule] Acron says “Mer-
curins dicitur esse dator opum: Hercules
vero custos ;’' and Porphyrion “ideo quod
thesauris praeest: et sunt qui eundem in-
cubonem quoque esse velint3 unde putant
et quod res rustica in tutela sit ejus, nam
illi sacrificia reddunt rustici cum juvencos
domuerint.'’ ‘Incubo’ is applied to one
who watches over a treasure in a passage
of Petronius quoted by Forcellini. Though
Hercules was especially a Grecian hero,
and was in no way connected historically
with the Romans, he was held by them
in high esteem. He had a temple in the
north part of the city near that of Venus
’ Erycina, and not sar from the Porta Col-
lina (Livy, xxvi. 10). We read in Plu-
tarch of Sulla and Crassus dedicating a
tenth of their whole fortune to Hercules,
and feasting the people magnificently in
his honour. (Sulla, c. 353 Crassus, c. 2.
12.) He was associated with Mercury in
various ways3 as the god of gain, which
we find here and in the offerings above
mentioned, which were of frequent occur-
rence ; as the god of ways and of bounda-
ries, ‘vialis’ and ‘terminalis ;’ and like-
wise as presiding over the ‘palaestra'
There are representations of the two gods
in one, of which a specimen is given in
Agostini's collection from a gem (No. 109),
and he mentions having seen others on
rings that had been worn by ‘athletae‚’
and many statues in marble. The com-
bined form is called Ἐρμηρακλῆς by
Athenaeus, and it appears to have been
very common. The notion seems to be
that of combining strength and cunning.
[Comp. Cic. ad Att. i. 4: “Quod ad me
de Hermathena scribis.']

13. quod adest] See C. iii. 29. 32: ‘quod
adest memento Componere aequus,” It is
an adaptation of the Greek τὸ παρόν.
‘Gratum juvat' may either mean ‘satis-
fies me for I am grateful,' or ‘is welcome
and satisfies me.’ Orelli prefers the
latter.

16. in montes et in arcem] C. iii. 4. 21 =
“ Vester, Camenae, vester in arduos Tollor

Sabinos.'’ By ‘ arcem ³ he means his house
on the Sabine hills.

17. Quid prius illustrem] ‘ What sub-
ject should 1 take in preference to this ς’
that is, the country to which he retires.
On ‘ pedestri’ see C. ii. 12. 9 n.

18. plumbeus Auster] The south-wind
is so called as depressing the energies and
spirits. The epit-het is very expressive,
‘ the leaden south? Compare C. ii. 14.

“ Frustra per Auctumnos nocentem
Corporibus metuemus Austrum ;”

and C. iii. 23. 8: “ Pomifero grave tempus

anno ;” and Epp. i. 7. 5:

“ — dum ficus prima calorque
Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris?

Juvenal also speaks thus:

‘⁶ — J am letifero cedente pruinis
Auctumno, jam quartanam sperantibus
aegris.'’ (S. iv. 56.)
And again—

“ Grandi} 'sotm'm metuique jubet Septembris
e us ri

Adventum.'' (S. vi. 517.)

Auster and Notus are not distinguished
by the poets. They are represented as
bringing heavy rains: “quid cogitet hu·
midus Auster '³ (Georg. i. 462). Ovid has
a representation, which seems to have
been taken from a picture (Met. i. 2649:

“ Madidis Notus evolat alis,
Terribilem picea tectus caligine vultum.
Barba gravis nimbis3 canis fluit unda ca·
Froglldlssedent nebulae: rorant pennaeque

sinusque.'’

 

Statius refers to these ‘sinus' or folds of
his garments, it would seem from another

picture ε
sed plurimus Auster

Inglomerat noctem, et tenebrosa volumina

torquet,
Defunditque imbres.” (Theb. i. 350.)
