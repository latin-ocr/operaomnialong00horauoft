672 HORA'PII FLACCI

Munditiae pepulere; sed in longum tamen aevum

Manserunt hodieque manent vestigia ruris. 160
Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis,

Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere coepit

Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent.

Tentavit quoque rem, si digne vertere posset,

Et placuit sibi, natura sublimis et acer3 165
Nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet,

Sed turpem putat inscite metuitque lituram.

Creditur ex medio quia res arcessit habere

Sudoris minimum, sed habet comoedia tanto

Plus oneris quanto veniae minus.

below). According to this it survived
Lucilius, and was not extinct when Cicero
was born. Horace says traces of the old
rudeness remained in his day, probably in
the less polished ‘mimes‚’ and in the ‘ Fes—
cennina carmina,' which were not extinct.
Niebuhr quotes the “lex horrendi carmi-
nis,’' given in Livy (i. 26) as a specimen of
this measure :—
*“ Duumviri perduellionem judicent

Si a. duumviris provocavit,

Provocatidne certato:

Si vincent caput 6bn1'1bito:

Infelici §.rbore reste suspendito:

Verberato intra vel extra pomodrium?

I have given the verses according· to Nie-
buhr's arrangement and accentuation, but
they appear to be quite arbitrary, and show
no trace of rhythm. It was with reference
to the Saturnian verses that Ennius said:-

“ Scripsere alii rem
Versibus quos olim Fauni vatesque cane-
bant,
Quum neque Musarum scopulos quisquam
superarat,
Nec dicti studiosus erat.''

This verse, Niebuhr says (ἰὶ. 592 n.)‚ was
always used in inscriptions ; as that in
which Τ. Quinctius, the dictator, recorded
his capture of nine towns, ΔΑΜ). 375 (Livy
vi. 29), the earliest inscription on record.
It has been thus restored :—

“ J fippiter atque Divi omnes hoc dederunt
Ut 'ritus Quinctius dictator (Romanus)
Oppida n6vem (diebus novem) caperet?

To such specimens of Saturnian verse Ho—
race's epithet is not misapplied ; but I be·
lieve, with all deference to Niebuhr, that
they afford no idea of the structure of the
Saturnian verse. Any nation, with any

Adspice, Plautus 170

pretension to poetry, would have something
better than this. [‘ Grave virus :’ this
seems to refer not to the matter, but to
the form of the Saturnian verse, which was
driven out of fashion by an improved ver-
sification (munditiae).]

161. Serus enim] ‘ Romanus’ must be
understood here.

163. Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aee-
chylus] Thespis is here introduced as the
reputed founder of Greek tragedy, but there
is, we believe, no authority for his having
left any thing written. (See A. P. 275 n.)

167. metuitque lituram] That is, they
were bold enough in their style, and had the
spirit of tragedy in them, but they did not
look sufficientlyto the correction and polish-
ing of their language 3 they admitted words
which were out of taste‚ and thought too
much care in composition beneath them.
This is pretty much what he says of Lucilius
(S. i. 10. 56 sqq.).

168. arcessit] Epp. i. 5. 6 n. ‘Ex me-
dio' is from common life. Horace says
comedy is supposed to be very easy, because
the matter is common 3 but, in fact, it gives
more trouble in proportiontothe readiness
with which it is criticized and faults are
detected and condemned.

170. Plautus] Orelli thinks he sees in
this place remarkable pleasantry (⁶ singu-
larem festivitatem a nullo adhuc animad—
versam ’). Suetonius (Aug. c. 89) says:
“Augustus plane poematum quoque non
imperitus delectabatur etiam comoedia ve-
teri, et saepe eam exhibuit publicis specta-
culis.'’ He thinks therefore Horace is

joking the emperor upon his taste for the

old comic writers, Horace had no great
opinion of Plautus, whose greatness, he
says, lay in the drawing of small parts.
Niebuhr judges otherwise: he calls him
one of the greatest poetical geniuses of an-
