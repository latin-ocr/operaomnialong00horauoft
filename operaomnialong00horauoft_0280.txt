244 HORATII FLACCI

Non possidentem multa vocaveris 45
Recte beatum : rectius occupat
Nomen beati qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti
Duramque callet pauperiem pati,
Pejusque leto flagitium timet, 50
Non ille pro caris amicis
Aut patria timidus perire.

GARMEN X.

That this Ligurinas is a merely poetica! personage Ι have not the remotest doubt,
no more than that Horace composed the ode with a Greek original before him or in
his mind. The absurdities which any other view of the case involves are nnmberless.
The ode may have been written at any time. There is nothing to fix the date of its
composition, for the fact of the same name occurring in the first ode of this book,

merely for the purpose of poetica] ornament, proves nothing at all. It reads more like
an early composition than a late one.

ARGUMENT.

Cruel and lovely boy3 when the down shall have passed upon thy cheek, and thy
flowing looks have fallen, and thy sost eomplexion vanished, thou shalt look in the

ings have Ι not the beauty I had then 1³³²
