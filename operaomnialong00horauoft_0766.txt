Vesanum tetigisse timent fugiuntque poetam

HORATII FLACCI ARS POETICA.

455

Qui sapiunt 3 agitant pueri incautique sequuntur.
Hic dum sublimis versus ructatur et errat,

Si veluti merulis intentus decidit auceps

In puteum foveamve‚ licet “ Succurrite'' longum

Clamet, “ Io cives !” non sit qui tollere curet.

460

Si curet quis opem ferre et demittere funem,
“ Qui seis an prudens hue se projecerit atque
Servari nolit ?” dicam, Siculique poetae

Narrabo interitum. Deus immortalis haberi

Dum cupit Empedocles, ardentem frigidus Aetnam
Sit jus liceatque perire poetis :

Insiluit.

465

Invitum qui servat idem facit occidenti.
Nec semel hoc fecit, nec si retractus erit jam
Fiet homo et ponet famosae mortis amorem.

Nec satis apparet cur versus factitet, utrum

470

Minxerit in patrios cineres, an triste bidental
Moverit incestus ε certe furit ac velut ursus

· Objectos caveae valuit si frangere clathros‚
Indoctum doctumque fugat recitator acerbus 3

Quem vero arripuit tenet occiditque legendo,

475

Non missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo.

The Greeks called persons supposed to be
so affected σεληνιακοί.

455. tetigisse timent] ‘The wise avoid
him as if he were infectious 3 fools run after
him like children aster a crazy man in the
streets.'

·459. Zonyum clamet] This is like Ho-
mer's μακρὸν ἄϋσε (ll. iii. 81).

[460. non sit qui] ¹ Let no man take the
pains =t0 help him? See S. ii. 5. 91, and
Epp. i. 18. 72.]

464. Deus immortalis haberi] See Epp.
i. 12. 20. There are various marvellous
stories told of the death of Empedocles,
suited to the character he bore in his life.
[Diogenes Laertius viii. 51, ὅπα] “Ac-
cording to the most probable of these
discrepant statements, being at last ex-
pelled his native city (Agrigentum), he
retired to the Peloponnesus, and there
brought his marvellous existence to a close.
This story is from Timaeua in whose his-
tory Empedocles is frequently mentioned.
'rhe statement of his death in Aetna can be
traced back to Heraclides Ponticus, a very
insufficient authority, and who believed in
it '’ (Ritter, Hist. Anc. Phil. i. 492).

467. Invitum qui servat] See Epp. i.
20. 15 n. This is apparently a proverb.
Seneca has the same (Phocn. 100) : “ oeci-
dere est vetare cupientem mori-'¹ The
construction of ‘idem occidenti' is Greek,
ταύτὸ τῷ ἀποκτείνοντι. Orelli observes
that this is the only spondaic hexameter in
Horace.

469. Fiet homo] He keeps up the allu-
sion to Empedocles, sayiug that the frenzied
poet is as resolved to rush to his fate (that
is, into verse) as the philosopher was, and
if you save him he will not drop his pre-
tension to inspiration. [‘ Homo‚' a reason-
able man.]

470. Nee satis apparet] The crime for
which he has been thus sent mad does not
appear 3 whether it be for fouling his
father’s grave or setting foot upon polluted
ground. ‘ Bidental ' was a spot struck by
lightning, so called from the sacrifice of a
sheep (bidens) offered upon it for expiation.
Ι agree with Orelli in taking ‘moverit’ in
the sense of ‘ violaverit,' as in “ Dianae non
movenda numina ’¹ (Epod. xvii. 3). Some
take it to mean the removal of the mark
placed on the spot.
