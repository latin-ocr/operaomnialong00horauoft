‘quid ni?' which was suggested to Lam·
binus by a friend of his, and which he
liked, but supposed it to want authority,
which has since been supplied by four of
Fea's MSS„ is as bad as possible. Acron
has the following note ‘⁶ quid enim: quare
non: et est comicum,” from which it is
inferred his reading was ‘quidni ’θ’ Whe-
ther that be so or not, the reading is a bad
one.

8. Memento cita mor-s· venit]
momento’ is a common phrase in Livy and
other writers. Horace has ‘ puncto mobilis
horae ’ (Epp. ii. 2. 172). Punctnm' is per-
haps a little more precise than ‘momen-
tum,’ which signifies the progress of time,
though conventionally its smallest division.
Pliny draws a distinction between them
(Panegy. c. 56. 2): “quod momentum,
— quod immo temporis punctum aut beneficio
sterile aut vacuum laude ?'' Lambinus, on
the authority of four of his MSS„ but
against all the best, reads ‘momento aut
cita ;’ and Bentley follows him, saying,
that without the disjunctive particle the
reading is “ominosum plane et infaustum?
Heindorf puts in the particle, but I think
it is better omitted. It gives too much
precision to the sentence, considering the
position of the speaker, as Reisig observes.

9. juris legumque peritus] “ J ura dabat
legesque viris ’' (Aen. i. 507). “ Haec nos
juris, legum, urbium societate devinxit”
(Cic. de N. D. ii. c. 59). On the distinc-
tion between ‘leges’ and ‘jus' see Dict.
Ant„ article ‘Jus‚' and Mr. Long²s Ex—

‘ Horae

cursus on Edicta Magistratuum (Cic. in
Verr. i. 177, 2nd ed.). Cicero (de Or. i.
48) thus defines a jurisconsultus: “Sin
autem quaereretur quisnam jurisconsultus
vere nominaretur, eum dicerem qui legum
et consuetudinis ejus qua privati in civi-
tate uterentur, et ad respondendum et ad
agendum et ad cavendum peritus esset3
et ex eo genere Sex. Aelium, M'Manilium‚
P. Mucium nominarem.’' L. Crassus (de
Or. iii. 33) says that he had seen M'Mani-
lius “transverso ambulantem foro, quod
erat insigne eum qui id faceret facere civi-
bus omnibus consilii sui copiam3 ad quos
olim et ita ambulantes et in solio sedentes
domi sic adibatur, non solum ut de jure
civili ad eos, verum etiam de filia collo·
canda, de fundo emendo, de agro colendo,

de omni denique aut officio, aut negotio,
referretur.'’ The same he says yvas the
practice of P. Crassus, Ti. Coruncanius,
and Scipio, all Pontifices Maximi, who
gave their advice on the Jus Pontificium
and matters not only of law, but of pri·
vate interest, on all questions of daily life
and religion. At the time Horace wrote,
the J us respondendi, whatever it meant
(Puchta‚ i. 559. lst ed. lust„ and art.
‘ J urisconsultus,’ Dict. Ana), was not esta-
blished, and the number of those who gave
legal advice was probably large, but they
were always distinet from the professura
and teachers, and ‘advocati,’ and others,
who were paid for their services, and from
‘oratore5‚' though the ‘consultus’ some—
times was an ‘orator' or ‘patronus,’ which
is included in the word ‘ageress used by
Cicero above. If we are to believe this
statement of Horace, and another to the
same effect (Epp. ii. 1. 103),

“ Romae dulce diu fnit et sollenne reclusa
Mane domo vigilare, clienti promere jura‚”

and that of Cicero (pro Mareu. c. 9),
“ Vigiles tu (that is, Servius Sulpicius) de
nocte ut tuis consultoribus respondeas ς
ille (that is, a general) ut eo quo intendit
cum exercitu perveniat 3 te gallorum, illum
buccinarum cantus exsuscitat‚”—we must
suppose that these learned persons, who
gave their ‘responsa’ gratuitously, sacri-
ficed their own convenience to the anxiety
of their clients, and received them at a
very early honr in the morning. On
‘laudat' see v. 3 n. [‘ Sub galli cantum ε’
‘about coek-crow.’ See Epod. ii. 44 n.]

11. datis vadibus] The term ‘vades
dare,’ or more exactly ‘ promittere‚’ is ex-
plained clearly in Mr. Long’s note on cio.
in Verr. Act. ii. 3. 15. ‘ Vades’ were
sureties provided by the defendant, to se-
cure his appearance before the praetor at a
time agreed upon between the plaintiff and
himself. If he did not appear, he forfeited
the amount of the ‘ vadimonium ’ or -
ment, and his ‘ vades ' were liable to pay it
if he did not. (See S. i. 9. 36 n.) The
person here represented therefore is the
defendant in an action going up reluctantly
to Rome, to appear before the Praetor-'ac-
cording to his agreement. ‘ Ille' is as if
the man were before us.
