marku are worth nothing. They are akin to the allegorical interpretation of Homer
which treated his works as an inexhaustible fountain of wisdom, and overlaid the
critical with a fanciful view. That a sensible man might get some good lessons from
the Iliad and Odyssey is saying no more than may be said of any works in which
character is drawn in so many various shapes. But that the predominating impression
on the mind of a man like Horace, with good taste and sense, aster a continuous

ARGUMENT.

while you are declaiming at Rome, Lollius, I am reading Homer at Praeneste, a
hueber above Chrysippus and Crantor themselves. For consider, in that Iliad
of his how he sets before us the passions of princes and people: Antenor's sage
euna-013 the sellish obstinacy of Paris ; Nestor mediating between angry kings, one
inflamed with love and both with anger. The princes err, the people suffer. There
18 one scene of treasons, stratagems, crime, lust, passion, in the (111-001811 camp or
within the walls of Troy. 'rhen again he has given us a bright example of wisdom
in ulysses, driven over the earth and sea, gathering experience as he went, sur-
nmnded with the waves of suffering but rising above them all, and shunning the
eharms of the Siren and the sweet poisons of Circe. Why, we are but cyphers, born
only to eat *and drink, like the suitors of Penelope or the people of Alcinous, who
alept and danced and drove away care with the sound of the wauton lute.

Does the robber rise at midnight to kin, and do you not wake up to guard yourself
stom evil Ρ Nay then, if you will not practise running while you are well, you shall
do so with the dropsy’ 111 your skin: if you rise not early, and give your mind to
study and to virtue, you shall lie awake under the tortures of envy or lust. Why
are you in such haste to remove a grain of dust from your eye, but defer the curing
of your mind’ s dise-ase. ⁹ Begin and you have half done, be bold to be wise, begin.
He who puts off the day of reformationis like the clown that waits till the stream

But men are for money and ease, and for laying field to field. Let him that has
enough not wish for more. Riches will not take sever from the veins or grief from
the heart. 'l'he owner should be sound in body aud mind if he would enjoy what he
has got 3 but he who is always anxious gets no more good from his riches than the
blind from a picture, the gouty from a fomentation‚ or the deaf from the sounds of a
lyre; for if the vessel is foul, whatever you pour into it turns sour. Heed not
