Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister. 5
Si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,

the beginning of spring he suffered from
oolic, and in the autumn from oetarrh.
So that, Suetonius adds, in the shattered
state of his body he could hardly bear
either cold or hest. In winter he wore 811
extramdinary‘ quantity of clotbing‚ as
many as four tunies with 8 subucula (Epp.
i. 1. 9⁵), and a woollen covering for the
chent, and trouaers or leggings of some
saort. ln thahat westher he slept with all

9. fibula fias] Compare Epod. xi. 8:
“fibula quanta fui.” [‘Abjicito ε’ · throw
it away rather than. like a beust, dash your
panniers against the door to which you
are ordered to them.’ Ritter says
that ‘clitellas’ is only the ⁶ objectum ' of
‘ perferre ;’ but it may be the ⁸ objectum ’

of ‘ impingas ' alsa]

10. lamas] This word is only found
elsewhere in 8 verse of Ennius, quoted by
Comm. Cruq. and by Torrentius from 811 old
MS. Comm. Cruq. thus explains ‘ lamas ε’
“lacunas majores continentes aquam plu-
viam seu caelestem. Ennius: ‘Silvarum
nultus, latebras lamasque lutosas? '' Acron
also says ε “lama est aqua in via stans ex
pluvia ;’' and Porphyrion: ‘ lama est vorago.
λαιμός enim est ingluvies.’ Torrentius
mentions an old Lexioon which has “La-
mae : πηλῶδεις τόποι ;'’ and Foroellini
quotes Festus: “hcuna, aquae collectio
quam alii lamam alii lustrum dicunt?
Horaoe writes as if the man was going
some arduous journey over hills and rivers
and boga, whereas he had only thirty miles
or thereabouts to go along a good rond,
the Via Valeria, which passed very near
the valley of the Digentia.

14. ylen-as feriit-ae Pyrrhia lanae]
Comm. Cruq. says Pyrrhia is the name
of a slave in a play of Titinius, who stole
some wool and oerried it away so clumsily
that she was detected. 'litinius was 8
writer oscomedioe who lived before Terence .
Pyrrhia is formed from Pyrrha, the name
of a town in Lesbos, like Laebia, Delia, ἁο.
For ‘glomus’ Ven. 1483, Ascens. 1519,
and many MSS. and edition& have ‘globos.'
The common reading till Bentley was ‘ glo-
mos? but such a word does not exist, as
‘Glomus' is the
singular number and neuter gender. See
Lucret. (ἰ. 360) : “Nam si tantumdem est
in lanae glomere quantum Corporis in
plumbo‚’' where the quantity of the first
syllable is long. In ‘ glomero ’ it is short,
and in ‘globus‚’ but- all these words oon·
tuin the same root. ‘ Glomus' is a elue
or 11811 of wool.
