Mala vino lavere, aut exanimari metuentes

OARMEN XIII.

The situation and title of the fountain, the name of which is used in this ode, are suf-
ficiently proved by a bull of Pope Pascal 11„ Aa). 1103, first brought to notice by Cap-
martin de Chaupy in his work on Horace's country-house (vol. iii. pp. 364, 538), and
given more fully by Fea. - There was a monastery dedicated to the Vix-gin at Bantia
(O. iii. 4. 15), over hich the bull appoints a certain abbot‚ and over “omnia quae ad
illud (coenobium) pertinent—videlicet ecclesiam S. Salvatoris cum aliis ecclesiis de
castello Bandusii‚—ecclesiam S. Anastasiae apud Acherimtiam cum ecclesiis ad eam
pertinentibus ; ecelesiam SS. Martyrum Gervasii et Potasii in Bandusino fonte apud
Venusiam? De Chaupy made a journey to the spot, which he was able satisfactorily
to himself to recognize in a town called Palazzo, about six miles from the site of Venusia.
Acron says that Bandusia was the district in which Horace's farm was situated, and
some commentators following this statement have identified the ‘fons Bandusiae’ with
the small river Digentia. (Lieenza) in the Sabine hilis. De Chaupy sufficiently disproves
this. Lambinus adopts the Scholiast’s statement as well as his way of spelling the
name ‘ Blandusiae? which the above-named document sufficiently proves to be wrong,
though most editors have adopted it.
