CARMINUM Ι. 29. 67

'ARGUMENQ

What. Iccius, aster all dost thou grudge the Arabs their wealth, and prepare chains
fin· the princes of Sabaea and the ‚fisi-ce Mede Ρ Which of the fair barbarians dost

ᾖ thou mean to bring home for thy bed, or what royal page for thy table? Sure,
rivers shall flow back to their mountains and the 'I'iber turn again, if Iccius can
‹le-ert his books to put on the breastplate.

1001, beatis nunc Arabum invides
Gazis, et acrem militiam paras
Non ante devictis Sabaeae
Regibus, horribilique Medo
Nectis catenas ? Quae tibi virginum 5
Sponso necato barbara serviet ¹?
Puer quis ex aula capillis
Ad cyathum statuetur unctis,
‘Doctus sagittas tendere Sericas
Arcu paterno? Quis neget arduis
Pronos relabi posse rivos
Montibus et Tiberim reverti,
Cum tu coeJmptos undique nobilis

1. nunc] This word expresses surprise, 9. sagittas tendere] For ‘arcum ten-

 

‘what now! to belie all expectations and
abaudon all your pursuits !’

3. Sabaeae] The Romans had possession
of parts of Arabia Petraea but not of
Arabia Felix. Hence he says—

‘' Intactis opulentior
Thesauris Arabum?

(C. iii. 24.1.) The ‘horrible Mede? that
is the Parthian, is only introduced to
heighten the colouring of ythe picture.

5. Quae——virymum-barbara] A very
nncommon construction (like τίς ανδρων ,)
for ‘rgoquaevi barbara’ or ‘quae virginum
barbararum. ’ There* is humour m the ques—
tion, as if Iccius had only to choose for him-

self some royal damsel w hose betrothed he

was to slay with his own hand, and an

Easternpa ge of great beant) brought from

'u' his native wilds to wait upon one of the

princes of this happy land.

7. Puer ex aula] These words are to be
taken together. Boys whose office it was
to pour out the wine are called in inscrip-

'ss 'tione‘ pueri a cyatho’ or ‘ad cyathum, ’ or

‘ab argento potorio,’ ‘ad argentum poto-
rium? ‘a potione? andsoforth. Feaspea ks

Rome ιιι 1780. [Cdmp. Suetou. Caesar, c.

,ι 49, ‘ad cyathum stetisse. ‘]

dere! Virgil also says (Aen. ix. 606),

‘spicula tendere cornu‚’ and (Aen. v. 508)

‘pariterque oculos telumque tetendit! [See

C. i. 12. 56, iii. 29. 27, as to the name

Seres. The Seres produced the best iron,

sRays Pliny, H.‘N. 34, c. 14, quoted by
itter.

11. {honos relabi posse rivos] 'rhe
phrase ἅνω ποταμῶν became a proverb
ftom Euripides (Med. 410): ἄνω ποταμῶν
ἱερῶν χωροῦσι παγαί. Demosthenes uses
the expression (De F. L„ Reiskc, 433. 25),
ἀλλὰ δῆτα. ἅνω ποταμῶν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
πάντες. Cic. ad Att. xv. 4:
Carfulenus: ἅνω ποταμῶν.”

13. nobilis Panaeti] Horace might in-
tend this epithet for ‘libros ' or ‘ Panaeti)
It will suit either, since the accusative
plural is written in the MSS. ‘es‚' ‘ eis' or
‘is.’ Bentley connects it with the Stoic:
but whether he is right or wrong in his
conclusion, his reason is bad: ‘ne ‘libros’
duplice epitheto accumulemus? ‘coeinp-
tos’ is not an epithet, and there was no
reason why Horace should not say ‘nobiles
libros coemptos’ in the sense ‘quos 0οὲ-
misti' if he had lhleased Orelli agrees
with Bentley. [Ritter has ‘nobilesss which
is better.

14. Sag-raticam et domum] Socrate&
school, as Plato, Xenophon, διο. Cicero
