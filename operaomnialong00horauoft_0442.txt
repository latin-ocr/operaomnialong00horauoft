406 HORATII FLACCI

Ventre diem durare, domesticus otior. Haec est

SATIRE VII.

I do not think many persons will agree with Franke in his higb. estimate of this
Satire, the best of its kind, he says, and yielding to none or even preferable to all
others, in elegance of composition, suavity of diction, and dramatic power. , He wishes
to prove that it was not the earliest of the Satires, as most commentators suppose, some
judging from the quality, others with more reason from the subject. The subject is a
dispube, travestied Ι think without much humour, between one of the office-rs on Brutus’
staff and a merchant of Clazomenae (a town 011 the Gulf of Smyrna), arising it may be
Δ supposed out of some money transactions. Horace treats the matter much in the same

way as the dispute got up between the two parasites for the amusement of Maecenas
and his friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51 sqq.). He no doubt had some reason for disliking
Rupilius, which the Scholiasts supply, whether with any sufficient authority it is impos-
* sible to say. They tell us that this man’s native place was Praeneste (which may be
gathered from v. 28) 3 that he was banished from that town by his follow-citizen& that
he then served in Africa in the army of Attius Varus, propraetor of Cn. Pompeius;
that he was received into favour by C. Julius Caesar and made Praetor ς that after
Caesar’s death he was proscribed by the triumvirs and joined the army of Brutus.
Finally, that he was disgusted at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a military
tribune, and continually insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satire.
Persius, the Scholiast says, was born of a Greek father and a Roman mother. Beyond
this, which may or may not be true, we know nothing about him except what we gather
from this Satire‚ that he was a wealthy man and carried on a large business of some
kind at Clazomenae. Dillenbr. supposes he was employed as contractor for the supply
of corn in Brutus' army, and that his dispute with Rupilius arose out of transactione
connected with this business. D. and others (Spohn in J ahn’s edition os Horace, ed. znd,
p. 257) identify the hero of this Satire with P. Rupilius Menenia (that is, of the Trib'us
Menenia)‚,the Roman ‘eques' and ‘publicanus,' recommended by Cicero to Crassipes
the Quaestor of Bithynia (Ad Fam. xiii. 9). These theories are hardly worth men-
tioning in a case of so much obscurity. Comm. Cruq. says Persius was a ‘negotiator’
at Clazomenae. But the ‘negotiatores' (money-leaders) in Asia. and the other pro-
vinces were not natives (as Persius seems to have been), but Roman ‘equites’ They
were an important class, who gave no little trouble to the governors (Cic. ad Qu. Fr.
i. 1, c. 1), and their commercial transactions in Asia particularly were on a· large
scale. The dispute arose when Brutus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in
A.U.c. 711—712 (see note on v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satire was written it is
impossible to say3 not long, Ι think. It may have been made on the spot, and shown
to those who would find most amusement init, in the camp. I think this is more
likely than that Horace should have reverted to such a subject after his arrival at Rome,
