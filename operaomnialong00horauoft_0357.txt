and Bentley. ‘ Infidus' and ‘infidi ' both
have support from the MSS. But the

I cannot follow, but he reads ‘ infidus!
The old editions have ‘infidusss and I know
of none but Torrentius’ that has ⁸ infidi ’
till Bentley's. As father and son each
earned the epithet, it is not easy to judge
in this conflict of authority to which of
them it should be given. The poets of the
Augustam age, in relating the punishment
of Tantalus, refer only to that legend ac-
cording to which, standing in the midst of
water, with fruit-trees over his head (‘be-
nigna daps '), he is not able to resch either.
The other story, followed by Pindar and
the Greek poete, of a great stone suspended
over his head and ever threatening to fall
on him, the Roman poets do not allude to.
But Cicero does, and only to that (de Fin.
i. Is, Tusc. Disp. iv. 16). In the Barberini
Palace at Rome there ιι a rilievo contain-
ing a very striking group of the three suf-
fex-ers, Ixion, Sisyphus, and Tantalus, in
which the last is represented with a stream
of water pouring from his hands, which
are joined and raised to his mouth. The
expression of pain and disappointment
approaching to despair is admirably repre-
sented, to judge hythe engraving given by
Spence. In the same group Sisyphus is
represented as carrying a huge stone on
his shoulders up a steep mountain, which
seems to with Ovid's expression :
“Aeoliden saxum grave Sisyphon urget ''
(Met. xiii. 26). 'rbere is however bnt one
story about Sisyphus' punishment, which
Horace refers to (C. ii. 14. 20) as a ‘longus
labor? Nor is he inconsistent in respect
to Prometheus, whom in C. ii. 13. 37, 18.
35, he placoe in Tartarus. The story, as
related prophetically by Hermes in Aes-
chylus’ play (P. V. 1016 sqq.)‚ is, that the
Scythian roek on which Prometheus was
first bound by Hephaestus was struck

r- down, with him upon it, by Zeus into

Hades, and that he was brought thence
aster a long time (μακρὸν μῆκος ἐκτελευ-
τήσας χρόνον) to undergo upon earth the
punishment awarded to Tityos in hell, of
having his liver devoured by an eagle.
