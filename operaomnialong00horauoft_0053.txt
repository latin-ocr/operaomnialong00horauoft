OARMEN IV.

Lucius Sestius served with Horace under Brutus, and they were no doubt on terma of
intimacy (see Dict. Biog. Sestius 6). But this ode has probably as little to do with
1.. Sestius ss with any of Horace’s other friends. The poet borrowed his name to give
point to an ode written at the beginning of spring and moralizing on the uncertainty of
life and the duty of enjoying it. The same remark, with a change in the names, will
apply to C. iv. 7. Traces of imitation from the Greek are observed by some commen-
tatum, and some Sicilian poem containing references to Mount Aetna is fixed upon as the
source of this ode. Also it has been conjectured, that it may have been written at
‘Baiae or Velia in sight of the Liparaean volcanic islands, which may or may not have
been the ease. We do not want both explanations3 perhaps neither. Beyond the word
’ ‘ urit,' which seems ω be a translation of φλέγει, 1 am not aware that there are as
many traces of the Greek as might be found in most of Horace’s odes.

'she time must be quite the eommencement of the spring. The whole description,
in which the present tense is used throughout, indicates the beginning of those things
that aredescribed 3 and though Ovid, referring to the mouth of April (Fast. iv. 131),
speaks of the hunching of the ships,—

“Vere monet curvas materna per aequora puppes
Ire, nec hibernas jam timuisse minas?—
>Horaee’a words clearly refer to an earlier mouth. Rutgersius contends very strongly
that April is the mouth to which the descriptions of this ode belong, especially vv. 11, 12,
which, he says, refer to the Palilia, the festival of Rome's birthday, which was the 21⁸1:
April. But that is much too late. See note on v. 11. Rutgersius 'contradicts himself
by saying that the allusion in v. 9 refers to the practice of Roman matrons bathing with
their heads crowned with myrtle, which took place on the calends of April. Ov. Fut.
