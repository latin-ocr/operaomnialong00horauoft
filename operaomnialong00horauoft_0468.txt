HORATII FLACCI

Non ridet versus Enni gravitate minores,

Cum de se loquitur non ut majore reprensis?

Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentes
Quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit
Versiculos natura magis factos et euntes
Mollius ac si quis pedibus quid claudere senis,

Hoc tantum contentus, amet scripsisse ducentos

Ante cibum versus, totidem coenatus 3 Etrusci
Quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni
Ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque
Ambustum propriis? Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,

Comis et urbanus, fuerit limatior idem

Quam rudis et Graecis intacti carminis auctor,

tandis Lucilius fuit.” Porphyrion has a note
about Lucilius: “ facit autem hoc cum alias
tum in tertio libro et nono et decimo Sati-
rarum.” [‘ Nil mutat: ‘does he change
nothing? ' is supposed to mean ‘does he
find fault with nothing in the writings of
Accius?' Doederlein thinks that ‘mutat'
· may mean that Lucilius parodied some of
Accius' bombast]

55. non ut majore repr-ensis] “Quando
de se loquitur non sic dicit quasi melior sit
illis poetis,” which interpretation of Acron’s
—the true one no doubt—I give because
some editors, including Doering and Hein-
dorf and [Doederlein] make another ques-
tion of this verse, and translate it thus:
“When he speaks of himself, is it not as of
one superior to those he finds fault with?”
-which is contrary to the spirit of the
passage altogether. Horace seeks in Lu-
cilius a precedent, not for commending
himself, but only for noticing in a fair
spirit of criticism the poets that have gone
before him.

59. ac si quis] Orelli limits this use of
‘ac' after words of comparison to the
poets3 but it is also employed in prose.
(See S. i. 1. 46 n.) Horace says he is at
liberty to inquire whether it is not a
natural consequence of Lucilius’ tempera-
ment, and the character of his subjects,
that he wrote verses not more polished and
smooth than might be expected of a man
who was content with giving his lines the
proper number of feet, and took delight in
stringing together a vast number of them
in the shortest possible time. ‘ Pedibus
quid claudere senis’ 1 understand to ex-
plain ‘h0c‚' contented merely with this,
that is to say, comprising something (that
he calls a verse, for there is contempt in

‘ quid ’) in six feet. Bentley puts ⁴ hoc
tantum' in a parenthesis, which is unne-
cessary. ‘At‚' which is the reading of
some of the old· editions and of Lambinus,
and ‘ an ' the conjecture of Dacier and
Doering, are bad substitutes for ‘ ac?

61. Etrusci quale suit Cas-⁹3 Of this
Cassius we know nothing, and what Horace
says of him is no more than a jocular in-
vention that his writings were of ‚so little
value that they were burnt on the same
funeral pile with his body, or, rather, there
was enough of them to form a funeral pile.
The Scholiasts confound him with Cassius
of Parma (Epp. i. 4. 3 n.) : and many
editors follow them, forgetting that Parma
was not an Etrurian town, but belonged ta
the Boii in Cisalpine Gaul. Bentley again
“sua vineta caedit'' (C. iv. 12, Int.), for
he takes the Etruscan Cassius to be Cassius
of Parma, who was put to death by order
of Octavianus after the battle of Actium
(in which he took part with M. Antonius),
in A-lLO. '7233 whereas Bentley supposes
in his chronological scheme that the first
book of the Satires was finished in Amne.
717. Acron says his books were burnt
with his body, by order of the senate3 oon-
founding him with Cassius Severus (men-
tioned on Epod. vi„ Int.), in respect to
whom we read in Suetonius (Calig. c. 16)
that such a decree was passed.

63. capsis] See S. 4. 22 11.

64. Fuerit] See S. i. 1. 45.

66. Qunam rudis et Graecis] Anow that
he is more polished than as the inventor of
a new style of writing unknown to the
Greeks he appears to be, and than the mass
of the older poets certainly are. [⁶ Rudis '
agrees with ‘carminis ε’ but the meaning
of the verse is doubtful. Some critice
