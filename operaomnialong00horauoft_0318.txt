282 HORATII FLACCI

their authority, no ingenuity would have discovered that Menas was the subject of the
Epode, and notwithstanding the appearance of another name, the forgery of which it is
difficult to account for, in one or' two inscriptionS‚ it does not seem that a ease has-been
made out against that which until reeently has been the opinion generally received on the
authority of the Scholiasts. The MSS. with inscriptions bearing the name of Vedius are
four in number: one of Kirchner’s best is inscribed “ad quendam tribunum inimicum
poetae ;'' which title any one would naturally affix to the poem who had no clue to the
person intended but such as itself affords. But the vast majority of MSS„ of which Fea
has cited a large number, are headed with inscriptions to the effect that Menas is the
person attacked‚ though the copyists had so little respect for these titles that they were
content to take merely the substance of them, since no two MSS. exactly agree in the
words. Ι need not repeat that none of the inscriptions ean with any probability be
supposed to have been affixed by Horace himself.

ARGUMEN T.

I hate thee, thou whipt slave, as the lamb hates the wolf and the wolf the lamb. Be
thou never so proud, luck doth not change the breed. See, as thou swaggerest down
the road how they turn and say, “ Here is a scoundrel who was flogged till the crIer
was tired, and now he has his acres, and ambles on his nag, and sits among the
equites, and snaps his fingers at Otho and his law. What is the use of our sending
ships to attaek the pirates if such a raso-al as this is to be military tribune Ρ ”

tum were especially used in ships, and the

‘ Sors ’ is the condition which choice, acei-

dent, fate, or nature (as here) has assigned.
See notes ou C. i. 9. 14; S. i. 1. 1.

3. Hibericis — funibus] These were
cords made of ‘spartum,' usually said to
be the Spanish broom. It was made
into ropes especially for ships' rigging.
The Scholiast Acron and Cruquius’ Com-
iuentator both suppose Horace to allude
to a time when the subject of his abuse had
served in Spain. Mancinelli takes that
view too. If it were so, it would suit Menas
very well, for he was in all probability with
Sex. Pompeius in that country before he
obtained his freedom. ‘ Hibericis funibus '
might be very well used without any such
allusion, since the material of which cords
were made was known to come from Spain ;
but, if the person had ever been there, the
point would be forcibly felt. It may be

only way to give point to the epithet is to

observation of Mancinelli: ‘⁶ ‘Iber-icis fu-
nibus' ostendit eum fuisse Pompeii re-
migem in Iberia.” ‘ Peruste :' see S. ii.

7. metiente] Here “ metiri viam ’ is
perhaps rather more emphatic than it is
in other instances, as showing the man's
sti-ut and swagger. Acron quotes hap-
pily, “ Instabili gressu metItur littora cor-
nix ” (Lucan, v. 556). The Via Sacra, on v
the position of which see Epod. vii. 8, was
crowded with public buildings, and was a
favourite lounge. See S. i. 9. 1.

8. trium] Bentley was the first, I be-
lieve, to adopt this reading from the con-

added, in favour of the theory which makes jecture of Barthius. The MSS. have either
Menas the hero, that the mention ofSpanish ‘ ter' or ‘ t‚’ which latter may stand for

ropes seems to ifnply that the person had
suffered on board ship‚ if notin the country

‘trium’ as well as for ‘ten' ‘Huc et
huc? ‘ hinc et hinc' (Epod. ii. 31 ; v. 97),
