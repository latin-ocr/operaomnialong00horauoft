odesinhonour ofDrusus and'l'iberius as the leadingfeatureofthis book, andtheir
publication as the chief object of its publication, 1 can easily understand old composi-
tions and new ones comparatively indifferent being inserted to make up what aster all

would be but ι mall volume. 1 neither assent to nor differ fmm the dates given by
those 11110 assign an early period to the composition of the ode; but I differ, as every
oue must. from Bentley, who assigna all the odes of this book to a period long subse-
quent to Virgil's death, but yet supposes him to be here addressed. As Gesner says of
the'great critic, “ sua vineta caedit.” [Ritter also affirma that all the odes of this book
were written after Virgil’s death, and he consistently denies that the ode is addressed
to the poet virgil] 11· any body were to affirm that no virgil or invitation is really to
be found in the ode, and that it is a mere composition from the imagination or the
Greek, 1 should not quarrel with him, only 1 should still believe that it was composed
before the death of the poet, a.u.c. 735, with Virgil’s name added to give it a real
character.
ARGUMENT.

'l'he spring is come, the trost is ssed, the stream flows gently, the swanow builds her
nest, the shepherds are piping to Pan 111 the fields, and the days of drought have re-
turned, virgil. Bring me a box of nard and 1 will bring thee in return some generous
calenian from Sulpicius' cellar. If my bargain please thee make haste, lay aside
business and, remembering that thou must die, relax while thou mayst into folly for
a time.

J. temperant] This is explained by C.
‘i. 3.15 n. The Thracian winds are here the
north-east winds of spring. Their effect is
very differently described by Sophoclea
(Ant. 586), but the effect of a north-east
wind on the east coast of Greece would be

00111111οΠ11(ιὶ8;2. 21), quoted by most of tlie
commentatoris, speaks of northerly winds
called Ornithiae, which blew for about
thirty days from the zoth February. But
northerly winda prevailed throughout the

· spring, and continued into the middle of

summer, their quality changing as the sea·
son advauced. Lucretius speaks of them
in the height of summer :—

⁶⁴ Inde loci sequitur Calor aridus, et comes
una

Pulverulenta Ceres, et Etesia flabra
· Aquilonum'' (v. 740 sq.);

where he calls them “Etesia flabra‚” because
that name was given to all kinds of periodi-
cal vinds. These were the winds which,
according to one of the theories Herodotus

contradicts (ii. 20), caused the overflowing
of the Nile: ἡ ἑτέρη μὲν λέγει τοὺς ἐτησίας
ἇνέμονς εἶναι αἰτίους πληθύειν τὸν ποτα-
μόν, κωλύοντας ἐς θάλασσαν ἐκρέειν τὸν
Νεῖλον.

3. nec fluvii strepunt] This explains C.
iv. 7. 3. The time is not quite the begin-
ning of spring when the snows melt and
the rivers are swollen, but after they have
subsided, which soon takes place.

5. Nidum pouit] He alludes to Procne,
daughter of Pandion, king of Attica (Cecro-
pia), turned into a swallow. It is grace-
fully introduced here to gIve ornament to
a common fact and sign of spring. Horace
elsewhere introduces the swallow with
the west wind (Epp. i. 7. 13). The
swallow and not the nightingale is pro-
bably here meant, though Doering and
Dillenbr„ on account of ‘ flebiliter gemens?
suppose Philomela to be intended. It is
not easy to decide. One version of the
story changes Philomela into the swanow,
and Procne, the mother of Itys, into the
nightingale. A third version makes Phi-
lomela the mother of „Itys See Hom.
