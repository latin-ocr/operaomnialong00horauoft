SATIRARUM 11. 7. 525

SATIRE VII.

'nie substance of this Satire Horace puts into the mouth of his slave Davus, giving
him liberty to express himself as he pleases on the day of the Saturnalia, when much
lienes was granted to slaves in particular. Davus takes advantage of the permission
given him to abuse his master, aud to taunt the rich with a slavery (to their passione
and to the world) harder and more stupid than his own. He also taunts Horace with
,his instability aud weakncss of purpose, which part of the Satire appears to me to be
themost natural and amusing (see note on v. 23). The rest contains a great deal that
is dissgreeable and much that is common—place. It may perhaps represent the habit
of talking trash under the name of philosophy, which those who pretended to be of the
Stoie school had established, and the humour would be more perceptible to a Roman
os the day thau it is now. The commentatore speak highly of the wit of this Satira,
but most of them make little distinction, and praise all alike.

There is uo trace of a date in the Satire, but some think it probable that as S. 3 was
written at one Saturnalia, aud this makes mention of the same festival, and touches

⁷ ⁷ like the other upon Stoic doctrines, it was perhaps written a year atter the above. ’ Ι

 

do not see any force in this, nor does it appear necessary to suppose the Satire was
written at or near the Saturnalia. That way of introducing the subject might have
suggested itself at any time of the year.

ARGUMENT.
1 have besu long a listeuen my master, and though 1 wish to say a few words, Ι know
my position, and am afraid.
Is that Davus ἓ

Even so, Davus your indifferent good slave.

Well, it’· the Saturnalia. z you may speak.

'l'here are some men who are consistent in vice 3 others who are always lioveriug
between right and wrong. There’s Priscus, a man who changes every hour from
the fop to the plain man, from the stately to the humble, from the mke to the
philosopher, the very type of mutability. Volanerius the gamester, when he could
uo longer hold the dice-box for the gout, hired a boy to do it for him. But he in
his consistency was better off than the other man in his inconsistency.

What do you mean, scoundrel Ρ

Why you profess to praise the good old times, but wouldn't go back to them if yon

, might. In the town you pine for the country, in the country you cry up the town.
Ifyou ase not invited out, you pretend you are glad to stay at home3 if an invitation
comes, off you fly and leave your poor guests in the lurch ς gluttons they are no
doubt, but are you less so yourself Ρ

Suppose Ι should prove that you are sillier even than Ι your slave 3³ Don't be angry,
and I will tell you what 1 have picked up at the philosopher’s.

This man goes aster his neighbour's wife, Ι aster a common woman: which of us

- desei-ves most to be hanged Ρ I incur uo disgrace aud no danger. You are obliged
to put on all sorta of disguises, trembling with a mixture of lust and ffflr. Why
you might as well go hire yourself for a gladiator as submit to be tucked into a box
to escape an angry husband. You are much worse than the woman you seduce, and
deserve a heavier punishment. If you get out of the serape, of course you’ll take
care not to get into it again. ‘Not a bit. You will seek the first opportunity
