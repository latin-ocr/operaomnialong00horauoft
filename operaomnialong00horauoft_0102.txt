OARMEN XXIX.

K In the year of the city 730 an army was sent into Arabia Felix by ‚Augustus under

Aelius Gallus, who was governor of Egypt. The force chiefly consisted os troops sta-
tioned in that province (Strabo, p. 819 : Γάλλος Αἴλιος μέρει τῆς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ φρουρᾶς εἷς
τὴν Ἀραβίαν ἐμβαλώνι and p. 780) 3 but the prospect of wealth the expedition held out,
from the indefinite knowledge then possessed of the country, attracted young men at
Rome aud induced, it would seem, Iccius, a man of studious habits, to join it. The ex-
pedition was attended with disaster, and the greater part of the force perished. Iccius
survived, and we find Horace writing to him a few years later as Agrippa's steward in
Sicily (Epp. i. 12). Beyond this nothing is known of Iccius. Much has been said
about his being avaricieus, and that is the opinion of the author of his life in the
Biographical Dictionary usually referred to in these notes, who says that both in
this ode and the epistle “ Horace reprehends pointedly but delicately in Iccius an inor·
dinate desire for wealth.'' 1 do not think *this idea would have presented itself to so
many minds if the Scholiasts had not made such remarks as these: “Ad Iccium
scribit quem miratur philosophiae intermisso studio repente se ad militarem vitam
contulisse cupiditate divitiarum.”—“ Parsimoniam laudat cum mordacitate '’ (Acron).
“ Per quod videtur concupiscere divitias Arabum.”—“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui-

per avaritiam philosophiae studium militia mutavit ” (Porphyrion). Such remarks.

prove nothing and throw no light upon Horace's meaning. The point is not worth
discussing as respects the unknown Iccius; but the character of the ode is lost in this
view of it. It is a piece of good-tempered jocular irony, of which the point lies in
the man of books going forth as a conqueror to subdue fierce nations untamed before,
and to return laden with the spoils of the East. Iccius may have been of a restless
character aud not easily satisfied with his position, if we may judge of the language of
the epistle; but that scarcely affecte the spirit of this ode, in which there does not
appear to be any thing serious expressed or intended. Later times have seen young
and chivalrous men hastening to an El Dorado in expectation of wealth and dis-
tinction, and finding nothing but disappointment, and such appears to have been the
case on the occasion of this expedition into Arabia.

Jacobs has discussed these two poems in his Lect. Venusinae, Art. i., reprinted from
the Rheiu. Mus. 1828. As the expedition was some time preparing, it is not clear whether
this ode was written A.U.c. 730, the year of the expedition, or a year or two earlier.
