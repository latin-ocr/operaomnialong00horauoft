HORATII FLACCI

Nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius

Meae laborarint manus.—

Quid accidit?

Venena Medeae valent?

Quibus superbam fugit ulta pellicem,
Magni Creontis filiam,

Incendio nuptam abstulit.
Atqui nec herba nec latens in asperis

Radix fefellit me locis.
Indormit unctis omnium cubilibus

Oblivione pellicum.—

Ah ah! solutus ambulat veneficae

Scientioris carmine.

Non usitatis, Vare, potionibus,
O multa fleturum caput,

Cur dira barbarae minus
Cum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam 65

Ad me recurres, nec vocata mens tua

Marsis redibit vocibus ε

smeared the conch he slept on with drugs,
to make him forget all women but herself,
taking ‘ unctis’ with ‘ oblivione? My own
opinion is divided between this interpreta-
tion and the following: ‘ he is sleeping on
his drugged coueh, iu forgetfulness of all
women,’ including herself, as if she sud·
denly had seen him iu that position. 1
incline on the whole to Orelli’s version.
Those who are not satisfied with either of
these interpretations will find a new one
in nearly every commentator. The Scho-
liasts’ notion that Canidia was a seller of
perfumes has a little more show of founda-
tion (in. v. 59, 60) than the same as ap-
plied to Virgilius (C. iv. 12, Introduction) ς
but it is in all probability derived from
this passage only.. Acron's reading, ‘ sub-
urbanae? in v. 58, shows the cantion with
which the Scholiasts are to be followed.
In v. 60 the oldest MSS. vary between
‘laborarint ’ and ‘ laborarunt.’ Both have
an appropriate sense: the one declaring
that she never had wrought, aud the other
that she never could have wrought, such
ointment. ‘Quale' is equivalent to ‘cu-
jusmodi.’ The Subura was a street lead-
ing from the Esquiliae to the Viminal. It
was one of the most populous aud profligate
parts of the city.
“ Famae non nimium bonae puellam

Quales in media sedent Subura.’'
Martia-l, vi. 66.

62. Venena Medeae] She speaks as if
she had been actually using the drugs of
Medea.

63. suffit ulta pellicem] See Epod. iii.
[65.] Palla is the πέπλους ποικίλους of
Euripides, Medea, v. 1156, the gift of
Medea, which the new bride of Jason put
on, and was destroyed by it.]

73.] Who Varus may have been we
cannot tell. See C. i. 18, Introduction.
Some ancient inscriptions call him ‘Alfius
Varus.’ [‘ Caput :' see C. i. 24. 2.]

76. Marsis—vocibus] That is, by com-
mon spells or chat-ms, such as have been
learnt from the Marsi, and were usually
practised (Epod. xvii. 29). Gellius says
(xvi. 11): “ Marsis homiuibus—vi qua-
dam genitali datum est, ut serpentium
virulentorum domitores sint et incentioni-
bus herbarumque suecis faciant medelarum
miracula.” virgil has (Aen. vii. ¹758):
“Marsis quaesitae in montibus herbae.”
[‘Ad aliam paelicem cogitatio tua non
redibit? Ritter. This is certainly wrong.
The sense is, ‘you shall come back, and
your thoughts shall return to me, not
summoned by Marsic spells‚’ but by some·
thing stronger. Thea she says, ‘Majus
parabo,’ δια]
