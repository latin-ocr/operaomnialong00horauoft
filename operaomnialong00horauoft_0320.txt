284 HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN V.

There is so much likeness between this singular ode and part of the eighth Satire of
the first book, that it is generally supposed they were written about the same time, or
about ΔΑΜ). 721. A scene is represented in which the unfortunate woman Canidia
(Ep. iii. 8 n.), so unmercifully satirized by Horace for a succession of years, is the
chief actress. She is passionately in love with one Varus, whom she calls an old
sinner, but whose beart she is resolved to win. To this end she resorts to magical

philters, for the composition of which, in company with three other witches, she gets ⁴

a boy of good family, strips him naked, and buries him upto his chin in ahole, in order
that there with food put before him he might wither away in the midst of maging,
and so his liver might form, in conjunction with other ingrediente, a love-potion to
be administered to the faithless Varus. What could have put such a soene into Horace's
head it is hard to say ς but in treating it as one that actually happened, and that at
Naples (from v. 43), Porphyrion and those who have followed him show more simplicity
than judgment. That the scene does not even profess to be laid at Naples is clear

ftom the dogs of the Subura (58), and the vultures of the Esquiliae (100) being
introduced.

ARGUMEN T.

‘³ Tell me, by the godS‚ by thy children, if Lucina hath ever blessed thee, by this purple

” toga which should protect my childhood, tell me what meaneth this hori-id scene. why
look ye at me so sternly Ρ ” As these words drop from the trembling and naked child
Canidia bids them bring branches from the tombs, as creech-owl's wing and eggs
steeped in frog’s blood, poisonous herbs of Thessaly and Hiberia, and bones snatched
from the jaws of a hungry biteh, to burn in the magic flames. Sagana meanwhile
sprinkles waters of Avernus over the chamber, and Veia digs a pit where the boy
must stand buried to the chin that his marrow and liver may dry up and become
fit ingredients for the potion. Folia too is there charming stars and moon from the
sky. Then Canidia bursts forth, saying, “Night and Diana avenge me 011 my
enemies. Give me such an ointment to smear the old man with, that the dogs may
bark at him as he goes to his vile haunts. But what is this? How did Medea
succeed while I fail? I know every herb. 1 have anointed his bed. Ι see, I see.
Some charm more skilled has set him free. No common potion therefore, no hacknied
spell will I prepare for thee, Varus: the skies shall sink below the sea if thou burn
not with love for me.’' Then the boy breaks out into cursing, and says, “ The destiny
of man is unchangeable. I will curse you, and my curse no sacrifice shall avert.
My ghost shall haunt you by night, and tear your flesh, and rob you of sleep. Men
shall stone you, and wolves and vultures shall tear your unburied cal-cases, and my
parents shall live to see it.'’
