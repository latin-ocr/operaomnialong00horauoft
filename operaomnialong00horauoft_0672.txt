636 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE XVIII.

Here we have some more advice about the manner of winning the favour of the
great. The person addressed is Lollius (Introduction to Epp. 2 of this book). Though
a distinction is drawn between vulgar flattery and refined, and the first is condemned,
which in this case could scarcely be necessary, it would be hard to imagine any thing
more degrading to a fine and independent mind than the arts by which this young
man is taught to rise. It seems as if Horace thought there was danger of his being
foolish enough to prefer his books or his recreations or intellectual privacy to the
boisterous tastcs or varying humours of a patron‚—a folly of which he must by
no means be guilty. He was of an ingenuous disposition if there is any meaning
in the first verse; but he was to school his tonguc and his manners 130 a refined
servility, and to consider this act a virtue. That Horace was himself tired of the life
he recommends, we may infer from the closing verses. It would have been more
manly if he had held up his experience in the way of warning to the young man that
he should avoid these dangerous and dirty waters. Horace’s was not a vigorous
mind, but amiable, and in the small ways of the world sagacious to perccive but not
prompt to act.

The date is generally assumed to be A.U.c. 734, the year in which the standards
were restored by the Parthians. This depends partly on the accuracy of the reading in
,v- 56, where see note.

ARGUMENT.

Unless Ι am mistaken in you, my frank Lollius, you are not the person to aet the
parasite under the garb of a friend. There is as much difference between the two as
between a chaste matron and a hai-lot. But even a greater fault than this is an
affectation of roughness which calls itself liberty and virtue. Real virtue is a mean
between opposite vices. Yon shall see one at the rich man's table trembling at his
every look, catching up and echoing his words like a school—boy or second-part
actor3 while another brawls for trifles as one who would not give up a point or have
his bawling stopped, no, not if you'd give him his life over again.

(v. 21.) Great pcople h'ave a horror of the inan of pleasure‚ the gambler‚ the coxcomb,
the covetouS, though they may be ten times worse themselves 3 or the patron, if he
sees one aping him, will, if he be kind, admonish him, saying, “ Ι can afford to be a
little foolish: you cannot.'’ Eutrapelus, if he had-a spite against any one, would
give him some fine clothes; for he knew they would change the man’s character
entirely, that he would turn idle, profligate, spefflthrift, and come to abjecti poverty
in the end.

(v. 37.) You must never be inquisitive about your patron’s secrete, or betray
them ς 11οτ praise your tastes at the expense of his3 nor take to your books

⁷ when he wants to go out hunting. On such grounds the brothers Amphion
aud Zethus quarrelled 3 and as* the one yielded to the other, so do you yield to
your patron's kind commanda: put away your books and go with him to the
chase, and like him earn your dinner by your toil‚ as the old Romans did, especially
now you are young and swift and strong, admired in the Campus, and experienced
in war under our great commander. Besides you have no excuse, for you know
what manly sports are, you who have practised sham fights at your father's place in
the country. He who thinks your taste aecords with his, will praise your amuse-
ments to the skies.
