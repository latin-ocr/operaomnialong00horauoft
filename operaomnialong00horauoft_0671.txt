Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.
Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum
Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,
Aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,

Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam,

55

Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis, uti mox
Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.
Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum, licet illi plurima manet

Lacrima, per sanctum juratus dicat Osirim :

“ Credite non ludo; crudeles, tollite claudum.''
“ Quaere peregrinum‚” vicinia rauca reclamat.

ap . Δ crow open-mouthed is his
, illustrationes a greedy fellow‚ as “corvum
deludet hiantem ” (S. ii. 5. 56), and it
means this here. If Horace had any fable
iu view, the purport and application are
„sufficiently plain. A crow oewing over
the morse} luck or thieving has thrown
in his way, aud thereby attracting the
attention and envy of his brethren, ap-
plies to many a knave who loses his ill-
gotten gains through his own folly in
gnrading tl]1em. [Ritter refers to Phae-

rus, i. 13.

52. Brundisium comes aut Surrentum]
'1¹0 Brundisium a man might go on busi-
nens5 to Surrentum (Sorrento) for the
λ climate and scenery, which are very

healthy and beautiful. Surrentum was
made a Roman colony about this time.
We do not hear much of it as a place

· of reson-t, though from this passage we

. may infer that it was one of the pleasant
spots on the Campanian coast to which
the wealthy Romans went for change of
air. 'rhe wines were celebrated (Ep. 15.
16 ιι). In mentioning Brundisium, Ho-
rai-{1121 οὔ] have been thinking of his journey
wi aecenas.

54. viatica] See Epp. ii. 2. 26 n.

55. catellam This is a diminutive form
of ‘catenass an is used for a bracelet or
necklaeez ‘periscelis’ ap to be an
anklet, such as women and young children
of both sexes in the East wear universally.
But other meanings have been given (see
Dict. Ant.). ‘ Nota acumina’ means ‘ the
hackneyed tricks?

59. Fracto crure planum] The Romans
adopted the Greek word πλάνος for a

,vagabond and impostor. Acron says it
was the name of an impostor who resorted
to this trick in order to get a ride. As to
‘plurima,’ see C. i. 7. 8 n. Horace makes
the man swear by the Egyptian Osiris, as
if that were the most sacred of oaths.
Among other new superstitious the wor-
ship of Osiris and Isis had been lately
introduced into Rome. Efforts were made
from time to time to put it down, and
Augustus forbade Egyptian rites being
exercised in the city. [Dion Cassius, 53.
c. 2.] But under later emperors it be-
came established with the encouragement
of the government, in conjunction with
that of Serapis.
