SA'HRARUM 1. 10. v 425

SATIRE X.

'rho ιίιίο σε· mnarum nomae took in the fourth Satin-e (see Introduction, and
v. 6 n.)‚ led him into a criticism of Lucilius, which gave a fresh handle 1ο his adversa·
ria, who professed an admiration for that poet, but admired him for his worse faults of
uste, and espeeially for his combination of Greek words with his mother tongum—a
praefice the affectation of which no one would more instinctively feel and condemn than
χ Horace. The occasion did not give soope for much good writing, and the Satire has

² little merit as a composition. Somebody wishing to try his skill in imitating Horace,
prefixed to this poem the following verses, which are generally, though not univer-sally,
allowed to be spurious, but they appear in some good MSS. Franke (F. H. p. 107) says '
theyare genuine. Theyaredisenssed in an Excurms byOrelli‚ and in a paper by
Jacobs (Lect- Ven- xi.) :—

·“ Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone
Defensore tuo, pei-vincam, qui male factos
Emendare parat versus 3 hoc lenius ille
Est quo vir melior, longe subtilior illo,
Qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis
Exhortatus, ut esset opem qui ferre poetis
Antiquis posset eontra fastidia nostra,
Grammaticorum equitum doctissimus. Ut redeam illuc ;'’

ARGUMENT.

well-,1 said that anilius’ verses were rough. And who ean deny it Ρ But I gave
him eredit at the same time for his great wit. If allowing this 1 must allow him
, every thing, the farees of Laberius I must eall poems of great beauty. It is not
enough to raise a laugh, though that has its merit ς there should be terseness and
variety, going from grave to gay, from the severe orator or the keen satirist to the
polished wit. A mixture of humour and severity is the way to settle grave questions.
, 'l'his was the ground of the old comediam, whom Hermogenes and his mincing tribe
never read a word of.
¹⁸ Oh ! but Lucilius was great in the blending of Greek words with our own.” Block·
heada! Is that a great thing which Pitholeon can do P “ But a language com·
pounded of the two is surely so much sweeter, like mixing Chian and Falernian
winoess' Now I ask you, would you apply that rnle to the language of the Forum Ρ
And while our great advocates are working out their speeches with much labour in
1118 best possible Latin, would you mix up yours with Greek ἓ When I once thought
of writing Greek verses the shade of Romulus appeared to me by night, and bade me
rather oerry faggots to the forest. So while Alpinus is murdering heroes in bombast,
⁴ 1 stiek 10 my unambitious trifles. Fundanius may write comedy, as he does better
“ than any man living ; Pollio may write tragedy ; Varius bold epics3 Virgil bucolios3
my strength lies ἱ11 that style in which Varro and others have failed, though I am
not equal to Lucilius who invented it. I have no wish to rob him of the crown that
is his due.
But 1 said the flow of his verse was that of a muddy stream, carrying with it more
faults than beauties. Wess, do you never find a blot even in Homer, with all your leam-
