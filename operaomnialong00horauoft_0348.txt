HORATII FLAOCI

ALTERA jam teritur bellis civilibus aetas,
Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit:

Quam neque finitimi valuerunt perdere Marsi
Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenae manus,

Aemula neo virtus Capuae nee Spartacus acer 5
Novisque rebus infidelis Allobrox, “

Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube
Parentibusque abominatus Hannibal,

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas,

Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum.

Barbarus heu cineres insistet victor et Urbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula,

[1. Altera] If Horace reckons from
the civil wars of L. Sulla and C. Marius,
ΔΑΜ). 666 or 13.c. 88, a generation may be
supposed to have passed away. But it is
not safe to form an conclusion from the
words ‘altera aetas?

2. Suis et ipsa] Porphyrion quotes
, Livy, Pref.: “jam magnitudine laboret
sua,'’ and the commentators have gone on
quoting those words ever since. But
Livy’s meaning and Horace's are not the
same. What Horace says may be true of
any state that turns its arms against itself.
Livy’s words belong only to a state that
aims at universal dominion, and falls under
the weight of the burden. The practice
of quoting passages for the sake of a little
verbal similarity can do no good and often
misleads.

4. Porsenae] Though Niebuhr eon-
tends that the penultimate syllable of this
name is long, it is here short, and is so
used repeatedly by Silius (B. P. viii. 391.
480 3 x. 484). The losty language and
tone held by the Campanians aster the
battle of Cannae—how they expected that
Hannibal, when he withdrew to Carthage,
would leave Rome a wreck and the power
over Italy in the hands of Capua, and de-
manded of the Romans as a condition of
their assistance that one of the Consuls
should always be a Campaniam—is related
by Livy (xxiii. 6). As to the Marsic war
and Spartacus, see C. iii. 14. 19. The
Allobroges, whose country lay on the lest
bank of the Rhene, between that river and
the lsere, had ambassadors at Rome at the
time of Catiline’s conspiracy praying for
redress for certain grievances. These men
were tampered with by the conspirators,
and promised to sorward their designs,
which they betrayed, and became the

principal witnesses against the eonspimtors
(Sall. Cat. 413 Cic. in Catil. iii. 2-4).
Two years afterwards these people, having
broken out in war and invaded Gallia
Narbonensis, were defeated by C. Pomp-
tinus, governor of that province. The
restlessness of the Galli is mentioned by
Caesar (B. G. iv. 5).

[7. caerulea—pube] The allusion is to
the northern nations who were conquered
by C. Marius, ΒΛ). 102, 101, aster they had
threatened the Romans for some years.
Comp. Juvenal, xiii. 164, ‘caerula quis
stupuit Germani lumim']

8. Parentibus] This Ι understand lite-
rally as “bella matribus detestata '’ (C. i.
1. 24). Orelli and Dillenbr. take it for
the Romans of a former day, ‘our fathers?
Doering takes it in the other sense.

11. Bao-barus] This has been referred
to the Efflptians, and taken as evidence
of the ode having been written in the last
war with M. Antonius, which is not worth
notice. ‘ Insistere ’ is followed by the
accusative case sometimes ς Forcell. says
when it implies motion, as ‘insistere viam,’
a peculiarity which is found in the Greek
καθέζομαι ς but that signification is not very
marked in this passage, which he does not
quote. It more usually governs the dative
case, or is followed by the ablative aster
‘in.’ See Aen. vi. 563: ‘⁶ Sceleratum in-
sistere tmen? Ezekiel’s prophecy against
Tyre declares that Nebuchadnezzar “ with
the hoofs of his horses shall tread down all
her streets’' (xxvi. 11) 3 and Jeremiah ex-
claims: “At that time they shall bring
out the bones of the kings of Judah‚ and
the bones of his princes and the bones of
the priests, and the bones of the propheta,
and the bones of the inhabitants of J eru-
salem out of their graves, and they shall
