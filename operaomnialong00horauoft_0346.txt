310 HORATII

FL ACCI

Non feret assiduas potiori te dare noctes,

Et quaeret iratus parem,

Nec semel offensae cedet constantia formae,

Si certus intrarit dolor.

Et tn, quicunque es felicior atque meo nunc

Superbus incedis malo,

Sis pecore et multa dives tellure licebit

Tibique Pactolus fluat,

Nec te Pythagorae fallant arcana renati,

For-maque vineas Nirea,

Eheu translatos alio maerebis amores:

Ast ego vicissim risero.

which there can be little doubt he followed

1110 day, he says :—
“ Intonsi crines longa cervice fluebant,
Stillabat Syrio myrtea rore coma?
(iii. 4. 27 sq.)
Hence the expression in the text is almost
proverbial, and Neaera’s vow is one of

’ eternal fidelity. As to Apollo's hair see C. i.

21. 2, “ Intonsum pueri dicite Cynthium;''
C. iii. 4. 62, “ Qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
Crines solutos ;'’ and C. iv. 6. 26, “ Phoebe
qui Xantho lavis amne crines?

11. virtute] ‘ Virtus ’ here signifies
moral coumge, determination, and firm-
ness. See note on C. S. 58. The name
Neaera is formed from νείαιρα, which is
used by Homer, and is said to be an irre·
gular comparative of νέος, so that Neaera
signifies ‘ the younger?

14. parem] One who is his match,
equally loving and true.

15. Nec semel offensae] ‘Offensus’ is
here used as the object of dislike. Horace
says, ‘ His 111-11111000 shall not yield to the
charms of her beauty when once he shall
have learnt to hate it, and when the pain
shall have entered and settled within him.'
of this use of the passive participle ‘offen-
sus‚' Forcellini gives several example&
Bentley, admitting that ‘ offensus’ may
have this meaning, nevertheless alters
‘offensae’ into ‘ offensi ς’ for what reason,
he aska, had Horace to hate her beauty ?
The obvious reason, that he had been
cheated by it into loving her. There is
more in Bentley’s note of the same kind.
No man was ever less qualified for a judge

⁴· upon delicate points of taste or touches of
nature. The passage he says has been
corrupted by the audacity and ignorance
of the copyists and the interpreters, “me-
ram 1110 caliginem pro luce offuderunt?

But before he reaches the end of his note
new light breaks 111 upon him, and 110 will
allow the common reading to stand, if only
it be granted that ‘forma' signifies figu-
ratively Neaera herself ι “ Et tum senten-
tia sit, ‘nec constantia mea cedet tibi, Ο
formosa Neaera, semel mihi invisae? '' Any
sensible person will see that he concedes
the whole point, and that the ‘andacia,'
‘ ignorantia,’ and ⁶ caligo pro luce 01111003
are all on his own side. Ι do not find any
MS. authority for ‘ intravit ς’ the meaning
therefore is that he has not yet learned to
hate, and the wound has not yet 110001110
fixed and incurable, but that if it once
does 00, shewill seek 111 vainto recoverhis
affections.

17. Et tw] The reading of most of the
old editions is ‘ at tu,’ which Fea defends,
“ at enim particula adversans? But 00
‘ at ’ is not an adversative particle his de-
fence falls to the ground. Either conjunc-
tion would do, because neither of them 10
adversative, and an adversative particle
would be out of place. ‘ ’ ' -
reading of all the oldest known MSS„ and
of Porphyrion and Oomm. Cruq.

19. licebit] This nse of the future tense
shows the truth of Forcellini's remark, that
‘licet' and some other words which are
called by the grammarians con‘unctions
are in fact only verbs, aster whic ‘ut' is
understood. ‘ Licebit is used below (S. ii.
2. 59), and by Ovid (Ti-ist. v. 14. 3), “De-
trahat auctori multum fortuna licebit.”
The Pactolus in Lydia was not the only
golden stream of the ancients. The Tagus,
Hebrus, Po, and Ganges, had the same
