Bentley conjectures ‘capacis’ for ‘ra—

follows Servius (on Virg. Aen. vi. 152) in
reading ‘sede’ rather than ‘fine.' Tor-

GARMEN XIX.

This ode was perhaps composed at the time of the Liberalia, like the third eleg³y of the
fifth book of Ovid's Tristia, but in what year there are no means of determining. Orelli
says it appears to be copied from a Greek poem, because it approaches the character of
the dithyramb. Except in the subject the resemblance does not strike me. If Horace
had written on purpose to show the impossibility of reaching the force and beauty of the
higher order of Greek lyric poetry through the medium of his langnage, he could not
have succeeded better, and the ἐνθουσιασμός, “ furor,' &c.‚ which some commentators
profess to find in the ode, exist, 1 think, only in their own mistaken conception of
Horace's mind and writings. They create the inspiration they expect to find. The
subject is as likely to have been suggested by a Greek picture as a Greek poem, but
neither hypothesis is necessary. The scene is laid in the woods‚

ἵν’ ὁ βακχιῶτας
ἀεὶ Διόνυσος ἐμβατεύει
θείαις ἄμφιπολῶν τιθάναις (Soph. Oed. Col. 678 sqq.),
and the poet is supposed to come suddenly upon the party, consisting of Bacchus, with
his attendant nymphs, and the wild creatures of the woods, all attending with admiration
to the god as he sings his own achievements. The poet is smitten with terror, which
gives place to the inspiration of the divinity, in virtue of which he breaks out into echoes
of all he had heard. Ι cannot persuade myself that in this style Horace felt that his
strength lay, or that he made any pretension to the afflatus which his admirers claim
for him. There is skill in the poem ; but the Greek fire is wanting, as we may easily
conceive would be the case with a gentleman far-ming his own estate on the Sabine hills.
