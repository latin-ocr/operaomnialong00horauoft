1. Vile potabis modicis Sabinum Can-
tharis] It has been said before that Sabine
wine was none of the worst ; but it was
cheap and poor compared with the best, to
which Maecenas was used, and this probably

, had not had the benefit of keeping. Horace

commends it therefore by referring to the
circumstances under which it was bottled.
(1 use that term for the process diffwndendi
or condendi for want of a better.) If it
was made on his own farm, which Maece-
nas gave him, this would enhance the com—
pliment, which would be increased by his
having done it with his own hand. Jani

give his friend a hint to bring some better
wine with him—The most ordinary kind of
earthcnware jug· was called ‘ cantharus?
supposed to be the name of the inventor.
Horace had tried to improve his wine by
putting it into a ‘testa’ or ‘ amphora,’
which had contained some of the rich wine
of the Aegaean. (See O. i. 9. 7 11.)

5. Care Maecenas eques] Bentley, on
the authority of one MS, of the Royal
Society, edits ‘ clare’ for ‘care’ He admits
that ‘care' is consistent with the occasion
and the familiar friendship between Maece-
nas and Horace (C. ii. 20. 7). But he
thinks ‘ eques ’ wants an epithet: besides
Martial (vi. 58 ) has,

“Sospite me sospes Latias reveheris ad
urbes,
Et referes pili praemia clarus eqiies,''

But the character of the ode and the great
preponderance of authority in the MSS.
lead me to prefer the common reading.
Martial was not thinking of Horace or
Maecenas but of his friend Aulus Pudens.
A verbal coincidence, however unconnected
thc passages may be in other respects, is
always enough to fumish Bentley with 811
argument in support of a favourite theory.
Maecenas was content with' the equestrian
rank and would take no higher: hence the
frequent repetition of the title ¹ eques ' by
Horace and others. (See iii. 16. 20.)

7. Vaticani Montis imago] The theatro

must have been that of Pompey, which was

opposite to the Vatican hill and on the lefl:
bank of the river, the hill being on the
right or Etruscan bank, which gives pro-
priety to the words ‘paterni fluminis ripae,’
for Maecenas was of Etruscan origin (C. i.
1. 1 11.). Fea says he has obser-ved the
echoes of sounds striking on the Janiculum,
which was part of the Vatican hill. 'rho
antepenultimate syllable of Vaticanus is
long in Μαι-1181 and Juvenal. On ‘imago'
see C. 12. 3 n.

10. Tu bibes] The future has here the
same signification as above, C. 6. 1, 7.
1. ‘ You may drink if you please the richer
wines. 1 have none such? Respecting the
wines here mentioned see above, O. 9. 7 n.
Some of Lambinus' MSS. had ‘Caecubum’
which J ani says is ‘ornatius et concinnius,’
and Fea adopts it too. [Keller has adopted
the bad reading ‘ Tum bibes.’]
