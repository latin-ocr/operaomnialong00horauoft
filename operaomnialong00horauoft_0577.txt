 

Post hoc me docuit melimela rubere minorem

Ad lunam delecta.

Audieris melius. 'rum Vibidius Balatroni:

Nos nisi damnose bibimus moriemur inulti:

Et calices poscit majores.

Tum parochi faciem nil sic metuentis ut acres
Potor-es, vel quod male dicunt liberius vel

Fervida quod subtile exsurdant vina palatum.

Invertunt Allifanis vinaria tota

SATIRARUM II. 8. 541
Quid hoc intersit ab ipso
Vertere pallor 35

Vibidius Balatroque secutis omnibus ς imi

Convivae lecti nihilum nocuere lagenis
Affertur squillas inter muraena natantes

81. melimela] These were a sweet sort
of τοῦ] apple which, we learn from Varro
(R. R. i. 59) were once called ‘ mustea: and
afterwards ‘ melimela-³ The derivation of
the name sufficiently marks their flavour,
md Martial mentions them as vying with
the produce of the hive: “Dulcibus aut
cerunt quae melimela favis ” (i. 44).
[Heindorf supposes that the apples were
served up in the middle of the dinner,
whereas Nomentanus talked of these apples
during dinner, having nothing better to
”ys-2· Nos niti damnose bibimus] See
Terence (Heaut. v. 4. 9) :—

“ Oh. At ego si me metuis mores cave in
te esse istos sentiam.
Ol. Quos Ρ ΟῘι. Si scire vis ego dicam:
gerro, inens fraus, helluo, Gaueo,
damnosus.''

Vibidius means that if this stupid dinner is
to be the death of them, they had better
have their revenge first, and drink rninously
of the host's wine: if they do not they will
die unavenged. ‘ Moriemur inulti’ is bor-
rowed from the Epic style. See Aen. ii.
670; iv. 659.

35. Vertere pallor tumparoelu· faciem]
Fundanius gives two reasons why the host
turned pale when he heard his guests call
for larger cups: because when men have
drunk well they give a loose rein to their
tongues, and because wine spoils the palate
by destroying the delicacy of its taste. As
to ‘parochi‚’ see S. i. 5. 46. The host is so
called as the man “qui praebet aquam ''
(S. i. 4. 88).

39. laver-tunt Allifanis vinaria tota]
Allifiw was a town of Samnium, the capture
of which by C. Petilius in the second Sam-
nite War, Ast-c. 429, is related by Livy

(viii. 25). The Romans did not retain it
long this time, for fifteen ears afterwards
it was captured again by ¹. Marcius Ruti-
lius (Liv. ix. 38). Comm. Cruq. says that
there a large sort of cup was made of
earthenware. This the context implies.
‘Vinaria’ is properly an adjective, and
watiensem-³ aasz&
fered in shape but not in use. Both were
vessels either of clay, or sometimes lat-terly
of glass, in which the wine was kept. Their
contenta vvere usually poured into a ‘crater'
for the purpose of being mixed with water.
These persons helped themselves from the
‘lagenass and all followed their example,
except the master and his two parasites
(see above, v. 20). There was no sym-
posiarch, no ‘magister bibendi‚' and the
guests drank as they pleased.

42. squillas inter muraena natante-fl As
a> ‘squillas,’ see s. ii. 4. 58. ‘Mmfina’
was a lamprey, and accounted a great deli-
cacy by the Romans, who appear to have
sometimes kept them tame. They were
brought chiefly from the coast of Sicily.
See Martial (xiii. 80) :—

“ Quae natat in Siculo grandis muraena
profundo

Νοῒιὲ valet exustam mergere sole cu·
m.”

Macrobius (Sat. ii. 11) and Pliny (ix. 55)
relate, the one of L. Crassus and the other
of Hortensius the orator, that the each
kept a pet ‘muraena,' and each sh tears
when >his favour-ite died. See Mart. (x.

‘¹ Natat ad magistrum delicata muraena.
Nomenculator mugilem citat notum,
Et adesse jussi prodeunt senoe mulli.”
