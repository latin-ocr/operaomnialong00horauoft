buy bre-d. When he was asked who he
was, he answered in a tone of reproach that
he was a philosopher, aud that he was sur-
priseo that Atticus should ask a question
which his own εγω would enable him to
auswer. The good man’sreply was, “Vi-
deo barbam et panium philosophum nou-
dum video? ἐκ thynnos σοφοί was the
Greek way of representing such persons,—
mm whose wisdom lay in their beards.

, 18. Jam ad medium] There appear
fio have been three arches dedicated to
Janm in the Forum Romanum. They are
alluded to again Epp. i. 1. 54: “Haec
Janus summus ab imo Perdocet ;'’ i. e. the
whole Forum. Near the middle arch were
tha ‘tabernae' of the priucipal money-

21. offer—lavisset Sisyphus aere]
Homer (11. vi. 153) calls Sisyphus κέρδιστος
ἀνδρῶν. Damasippus says he used, before
hs lost all-his money-to employ himself
ffiffmmmffisamszffi
corinthi-n bronze (osten, but improperly,
mlled bum), of such antiqnity that the
flander of Corinth might be supposed to
have used them for washing his feet. This
snum upon the rage for antiquated piecoe
of fnrniture would have applied still more
to the habits of the Romans at a later
ϋηο. It appears to have gone to absurd

25

lengths during the Empire. Martial (ix.
58) speaks of the worn handles “ veterum
corinthiorum? He has an epigram on
Euctus, who was a collector of such pre·
tended antiques, one of which still showed
the dent it had received in the battle be-
tween the Centaurs and Lapithae. 'I'he
handle of another (a dove) was worn by
the hand of Nestor. Another was the cup
in which Dido drank Bitias’ health, and
so on. We have had (S. i. 3. 91) mention
of a dish handed down from Evander.
Martia] (ix. 60) speaks of a gentleman who
went about to all the most extravagant
shops, pretending he wanted to purchase,
aud ended by buying two eups for an as:

“—Consuluit nares an olerent aera Co·
Culllfilatxiizllitatuas et, Polyclete, tuas.

Expendit veteres calathos et si qua fue·
Poleuutllzi Mentorea nobilitata manu.'’

22. sculptum infabre] ‘Sculptured in
an unworkmanlike manner? The reverse
of this is ‘affabress used by Cicero (in
Verr. Act. i. c. 5): “Deum denique nul-
‘ affabre
atque antiquo artificio factus videretur
reliquit? The art of founding (fusum)
is of great antiquity, though the earliest
meta] statues were beaten out with the
hammer. Casting was a process of much
nicety, and the fitting of the parts re·
quired great skilL

24. unus] See A. P. 323 S. ii. 6. 57.

25. Mercuriale] There appears to have
been a mercantile association called Mer-

lum Siculis qui ei paulo magis

'curiales at Rome. Cicero calls it a ‘col-

legium' (ad Qu. Frat. ii. 5): “M. Furium
Flaccum equitem Romanum, hominem
nequam, Capitolini et Mercuriales de
collegio ejecerunt.'’ But Damasippus
merely means that his skill in ‘

bar-gains was so well known that he was
called all over the town a ward of Mer·
cury, and we need not suppose him ω’
