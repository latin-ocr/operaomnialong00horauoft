HORATII FLACCI

Tu mihi qui imperitas alii servis miser atque

Duceris ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.

Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens sibi qui imperiosus,
Quem neque pauperies neque mors neque vincula terrent,

Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores

Fortis, et in se ipso totus teres atque rotundus,
Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari,

In quem manca ruit semper fortuna.
Ex his ut proprium quid noscere?

σπαστα, as 116 calls them, were in use
among the Egyptians. Plato (De Legg.
lib. i. p. 644) speaks of man's passions as
Davus does: τόδε δὲ ἴσμεν, ὅτι ταῦτα τὰ
πάθη ἐν ἡμῖν οἷον νεῦρα ἢ μήρινθοί τινες
ἐνοῦσαι σπῶσί τε ἡμᾶς κα). ἀλλήλαις ἄνθ-
έλκουσιν ἐνάντιαι οὖσαι ἐπ’ ἐναντίας
πράξεις. Persius has imitated this passage
like many others (S. v. 129) :

Sed si intus et 111 jecore aegro
Nascuntur domini, qui 111 impunitior exis

. Atque 1116, quem ad strigiles scutica et
metus egit herilis ?''

 

83. sibi qui imperiosus] ‘ He who has
control over himself? Before Horace no
writer uses this word with a case after it.
Pliny uses the genitive, Seneca the dative,
after ‘imperiosus ’ in the places quoted by
Foreellini.

85. Responsare cupidinibus] ‘Responso’
is repeated in v. 103 (where however see
note), and Epp. i. 1. 68. “Fortunae re-
sponsare superbae.” lt seems to mean,
to reply to on equal terms, and so to be a
match for. The construction of the ad-
jective and infinitive is common in the
Odes, but not in the Satires or Epistles.
See C. 1. 1. 16 11.

86. in se ipso totus lere-s· atque ro—
tundus] ‘In himself entirely smooth and
round.’ ‘ In se ipso totus' is explained by
a similar passage in Cicero (Paradox. ii.) ε
“ Νο11 potest non beatissimus esse qui est
totus aptus ex sese, quique in se uno sua
ponit omnia-’³ [This passage also proves
that the line should be pointed ‘totus teres
atque rotundus: ‘completely smooth and
round‚¹ as Doederlein properly says. He
correctly remarks also that the Romans
do not use three adjectives thus, ‘totus5
teres atque rotundus? He compares S.
ii. 3. 309, ‘ab imo ad summum totus
moduli bipedalis! Ritter, who has the
wrong pointing, has also the absurd ex-
planation that ‘ teres ’ means round like a

Potesne
Quinque talenta

cylinder.] ‘Mancus’ means lame in the
hand, as ‘ claudus ' does in the foot. Au-
sonius has imitated Horace (Idyll. xvi.)‚
and his words illustrate these :—

“ Vir bonus et sapiens, qualem vix rep-

perit unum

Millibus e multis hominum consultus

,11111ἒὲ11366 6111 totum se explorat ad un-

ngidlegiroceres vanique ferat quid opinio

861111111Ξέ1, 1111111111 instar habens teres atque
rotundus

Externae ne quid labis per levia sidat.’'

Here ‘ rotundus ' is explained by the like-
ness of the heavens, which Plato (Tim.
p. 33) says the Deity σφαιροειδὲς {rupua-
σατο, as being most after his own image.
A parallelogram was also an illustration of
the ancients for a perfect man, taken from
that saying of Simonides in the fragment
quoted by Plato in his Protagoras (p.339),
and thus restored by Hermann :—

ἄνδρ’ ἀγαθὸν μὲν ἀλαθέως γενέσθαι χα·
χερὲίεῖξέκαὶ ποσὶ καὶ νόῳ

τετράγωνον, ἄνευ ψόγου τε·

τυγριενον.

Comp. Arist. Rhet. iii. 11. Eth. Nicom. i.
11, τετράγωνος. ‘ 'feres :’ C. i. 1. 28 n.
89. Quinque talenta] The Attic drachma
of this period, which is here meant. was
worth about the same as the Roman 116·’
narius, nearly 83d. (see above, v. 43 n.).
The mina was equal to 100 drachmae, and
a talent to 60 minae. It was worth there·
fore about 2125„ and five talents 10602.
Davus reckons in 1116 currency of Grec-ce.
The caprice ofthe man’s mistress is described
as before, S. 3. 260 sqq. His own bondage
is very well described by Cicero (Paradox.
v. 2): “An ille mihi liber cui mulier im-
perat, cui leges imponit, praescribit, jubet,
