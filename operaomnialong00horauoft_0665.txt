The two last verses are almost literally
translated in vv. 77, 78. Pentheus, king
of Thebes, hearing that a young stt-anger
has come to his country, giving himself out
to be Dionysus, and has tempted all the
women to go out and do honour to him,
sends his servants to apprehend him. ΤΙιε
god allows himselfto be taken, and, when
brought before the king, describes himself
as the servant of Dionysus. 'rheu follows
a dialogue, of which the above forms part.
The application is obvious. The good man
can bid defiance to the reversos of For-tune,
since at any time he wishoe he can call
death to his assistance, —a bad doctrine for
good men. Cicero did not appr-ove of it.
He says,‘ ‘vetat Ρ) thagoras· injussu impe-
ratoriS, id est, Dei, de praesidio et statione
vitae decedere'' (Cat. Maj. c. 20). [Epic-
tetus (Arrian, Diss. i. 25.18) says: isthe
house is too full of smoke, 1 quit it ; for
