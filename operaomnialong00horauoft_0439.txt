‘cicer, ’yread boiled, was sold m the streets
sorau as in ythe time of Martial (i. los.
10): “Asse cicer tepidum constatl' A
vege table dinner, with a t variety of
ffishes, is described by Martial in an inri-
tation to a friend (v. 78). ‘ Laganum’ is
described by the Scholiast as a flat thiu
cake, fried aud eaten with condimenta It
was sometimes fried under roast meat or
fowls, so as to get their dripping, and so

(See v. 108.) ‘Lapis albus’ was asmall
side· table of white marble. The wealt-hy
Romans had a great variety of tables of
the handsomest sort in their dining rooms
for exhibiting their p.late (S. i. 3. 13 ιι.)
All the plate Horacep had to show was two
cups andacya thus (C. iii. 19 12). lea
says that ‘lapis albus' does not mean a.
table, but a slab with holes, in which the

ported by another below it, the upper one
being called ‘ basis,’ the other ‘ hypobasis,'

Gruter, which records the presentation to

what he says to fix this meaning οιι ‘ lapis
albus‚’ which 1 should not have noticed if
Orelli had not adopted Fea's explanation.
The ‘ echinus ’ is a vessel nowhere else
mentioned by that name. The Scholiasts
give us the choice between a salt-cellar (in
the shape of an ‘ echinus ³), a glass bottle,
a leather bottle, and a wooden bowl in

quius says, “ locus obscurus est et ipso
echino spinosior.” Fea contends for the
salt-cellar, thinking Horace could not omit

all mention of thatg Some MSS.,aooord-1

ing to Lambinus, have‘ echino,’ making
