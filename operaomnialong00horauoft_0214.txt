HORATII FLACCI

I pete unguentum, puer, et coronas

Et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,

Spartacum si qua potuit vagantem
Fallere testa.

Dic et argutae properet Neaerae

Murreum nodo cohibere crinem ;

Si per invisum mora janitorem
Fiet, abito.

Lenit albescens animos capillus

Litium et rixae cupidos protervae;

Non ego hoc ferrem calidus juventa

Consule Planco.

Again, Cicero says (in Verr. ii. 4, 23),
‘⁶ Scuta si quando conquiruntur a privatis
in bello ac tumultu, tamen homines inviti
dant, etsi ad salutem communem dari 3911-

, tiuut.'’ Tumultus was “a sudden rising

or hostile demonstration,'’ as Mr. Long
says on the above passage. ‘Vis,' ⁴ vio-
lence‚' was either ‘publica' or ‘privata,'
aud the distinction between the two will
be found on referring to the article ‘ Vis'
in Smith's Dict. Ant. Horace, says he, is
not afraid of losing his life by any popular
insurrection and so forth, or by the hand
of an assassin or private malice.

18. Marsi memorem duelli] The Marsic
or Social War continued from A.u.c. 663 to
665, and the Servile War, headed by the
gladiator Spartacus, from 681 to 683.
Therefore the wine Horace wanted would
have been sixty·five years old at least. J u-
venal, one hundred years afterwards, speak-
ing of the selfish man who keeps his best
wine for his ownadrinking‚ says:

“ Ipse capillato diffusum consule potat

GARMEN XV.

This ode combines with the lyric something of the spirit of the Epodes. It is 1111-
possible to say why Horace chose so osten this same subject, but he always handles it
very sharply. (See C. i. 25 ; iv. 13.) Some critics suppose he wrote under 1119111110-
ence of his own disappointments, and they find particular periods of his life suitable
for the composition of each. This ode also has accordingly had different dates assigned
it. But I need not trouble the reader with such discussions. [In Atmc. 724 Chloris
was very beautiful. In A.t1.c. ’730 this ode was written. Six years were enough to
make this sad change in Chloris. This is Ritter's opinion.]

The ‘cadus,’ ‘ftesta and‘ amphora,’ were

.names for the same vessel-

[19. Si qua] If‘ qua’ is the nominative,
it is made long contrary to custom aster
‘si.' But it may be the ablative. ‘Fallere'
is equivalent to λαθεῖν. Newman’s ‘clear-
voic'd’ approaches as near the meaning as
we can render ‘argutae τ’ but, as Ritter
says, she plays on the ‘cithara,' and sings
also, we may suppose. See C. iv. 6. 25.]

22. Murreum] ‘ Myrrheum,’ Immbinus
and others. ‘ Cohibere’ is the reading of
all the MSS. Bentley prefers his own con-

Muretus: Keller}

28. Consule Planco] L. Munatius Plan·
cus was consul with M. Aemilius Lepidus
Am. c. 712, at which time Horace was in
his twenty· -third year. [‘ Albescens: ·’ com-
pare Epp. i. 20. 24, ‘praecanam ’— ‘ani-
mos: ‘spirit' ‘impetuosity,' as the plural
often signifies. ]
