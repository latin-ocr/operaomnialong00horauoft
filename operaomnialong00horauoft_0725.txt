’ Qu’rminus argutos vexat furor iste poetas ⁴?

Carmina compono, hie 818308.

Caelatumque novem Musis opus

Quanto eum fastu, quanto molimine circum-
Spectemus vacuam Romanis vatibus aedem !

Mox etiam, si forte vacas, sequere et procul audi,

Quid ferat et quare sibi nectat uterque coronam.

caedimur et totidem plagis consumimus hostem
Lento Samnites ad lumina prima duello.

Discedo Alcaeus puncto illius 3 ille meo quis?

Quis nisi Callimachus? Si plus adposcere visus,

Fit Mimnermus et optivo cognomine crescit.

Multa fero ut placem genus irritabile vatum,
Cum scribo et supplex populi suffragia capto;
Idem, finitis studiis et mente recepta,

Obturem patulas impune legentibus aures.
