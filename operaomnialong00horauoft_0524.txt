HORATII FLACCI

Aegrum ex praecipiti, mater delira necabit
In gelida fixum ripa febrimque reducet.

Quone malo mentem concussa?

Timore deorum. '295

Haec mihi Stertinius, sapientum octavus, amico
Arma dedit, posthac ne compellarer inultus.
Dixerit insanum qui me totidem audiet atque
Respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergo.'’

‘⁶ Stoice, post damnum sic vendas omnia pluris,

300

Qua me stultitia, quoniam non est genus unum,

' Insanire putas?

Ego nam videor mihi sanus.'’

“ Quid, caput abscissum demens cum portat Agave
Gnati infelicis, sibi tum furiosa videtur? '’

‘¹ Stultum me fateor, liceat concedere veris,

305

Atque etiam insanum ; tantum hoc edissere, quo me

Aegrotare putes animi vitio Ρ '²

295. Quone malo] See S. i. 10. 21 on
‘ quone.’ ‘ Timor deorum' is equivalent
to δεισιδαιμονία iu the sense of superstition.
⁴ Deorum metus ' expresses a right fear of
, the gods. But the distinction was not in-
variably observed. (Pers. S. ii. 31, “ Ecce
avia et metuens divum matertera.'') [‘Men-
tem eoneussa’ ι see C. i. 2. 31 11].

296. sapientum octavus] “ Septem
fuere sapientes Graeciae ε hune Stertinium
annumerat quasi octavum ludendo.’' (Comm.
Cruq.).

297. ne compellarer inultus] For other
instances of ‘compellare’ used absolutely
and iu a bad sense, see Forcell.

299. Respicere iynoto] This refers to
Aesop’s fable of the two wassets, alluded
to by Catullus (xxii. 20 sq.) :—

“ ——Suus cuique attributus est error,
Sed non videmus manticae quod in tergo
est 3'

and by Persius (iv. 23 sq.) ·
It is told, with the moral, in five lines by
Phaedrus (iv. 10) ε

“ Peras imposuit Jupiter nobis duas ε
Propriis repletam vitiis post tergum dedit,
Alienis ante pectus suspendit gravem.

Hac re videre nostra mala uon possu-
Alii 8111111111, delinquunt, censores sumus.'’

300. sic vendas omnia pluris] On ‘sic‚'
see C. i. 3. 111. ‘Pluris‚' Heindorf con-
siders, is simply put for ‘ magno? Other
commentators render it differently, as
‘ more than you have lost,’ or inore than
you ever got before, and so forth. [‘ Ma-
jorc pretio quam quod feras si non facia&

“ Accipe : primum

Ritter.] Horace quietly hints to Dama-
sippus that he had better leave off philoso-
phy and return to his trade, in which he
wishes him all success. In the ‚next verse
the MSS. have, with but one exception,
‘qua me stultitia: the amative, which
Lambinus 011 his own authority, and Cru-
quius on that of one MS„ changed into the
accusative. Bentley and some others have
adopted this reading. This construction
is common enough, but the ablative is a
legitimate construction and, supported aa
it is, ought to be adopted.

303. Ayave] How she and the other
Maenads tore her son Pentheus to pieees
for intruding upon the orgies, is told byOvid
(Met. iii. 701 sqq.) and others. The old edi-
tions, with scarcely an exception, have ‘ de-
mens! The oldest Blandinian MS. had
‘ manibus‚' which Bentley introduced into
the text on this authority, confirmed by three
other MSS. in his time, and since by several
mentioned by Fea. Why ‘demens’ ever
should have been forged, if ‘manibus’ is
the true reading, it is not easy to say.
‘ Manibus ' may have been invented from
Euripides, who two or three times s
of Agave with her son's head in her arms
(Bacch. vv. 967, 1137, 1275). These pas-
ffifisnfricss‘rffississd‘&tuilfffssessufftfiissifi
not proof. ‘Portat' expresses all that is
meant without the addition of ‘ manibus?
All Orelli's MSS„ which are some of the
best, have ‘demens.’ He edits ‘ manibus-⁹
The St. Gallen MS. has ‘vel manibus'
superscribed over ‘demens.’ [Ritter has
‘manibus'.]
