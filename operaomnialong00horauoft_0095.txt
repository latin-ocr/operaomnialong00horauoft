⁷29, that the ode was composed. Some, however, have referred it to the period when
thtes’ ambassadors were in treaty with Augustus, and when the fate of Tiridates
mundecided, which would put the date a year lator. Others again have assumed
unt the whole of the transactions described by Justin are to be referred to the year
⁷24, and that Tiridates never fied to Augustus in Spain at all. This is the judgment
of lachmann (Let. to Franke, p. 239), but it is rather an unwarrantable judgment.

than Lachmann what it contained Risi-cason, moreover, for wishing to place the date .

ottho ode further back is nothing more thanan objection to the rhythm of the '7th and
llth verses, which is a very fallacious argument. In favour of the earlier date is

'eight in the age ofInmis. He died asne. '786 (TaaAnn. vi. 27), and the year before
, he had held the office of praefect of the city. Ifhe was only twenty when this ode was
written, he must have been eighty-two when he died, and eighty-one when he held the
. above post, which was made one of considerable importance by Augustus, and continued
to he so under his successor. He is described as being ‘ vivida senectute’ at the close
of his life, and it is just possible he may have held the above post at that advanced age,
