M he* was dead when this Satire was written. 1 am inclined to doubt this, for
though it is possible Horaee may have used the old man's name even if he was dead, it

some chronologists aster all the others of the second book. Franke argues from the
allusion in v. 15 to the Parthiam, that it must have been written in sanc. 724, when,
aster the battle of Actium, Augustus was in Asia settling the affairs of the East (C. i.
26, lut). 1 think this is a weak foundation for his assumption. As 1 have said before,
aa conquest of the Parthians was a subject the Romans of this period had contiuually

ἵ ⁵ ὤάιω them, and to allude to the wounds of the Parthian prostrate ou the field of

hub (“aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi ”) would have been more natural
nt almost any time than when Augustus was carrying on peaeeful negotiatione with
unt puple, without any immediate intention or prospect of coming to blows with

ινα-ιο is repeated from that Satire in this (v. 22). Horace writes however as if he

in un scene, no particular inference as to time ean be dmwn fiom it. Because
Cuenr is called ‘invictus’ (v. 11), Kirchner supposes the Satire could not have been
written fill aster the death of M. Antonius and the final establishment of Augustus'
pone. He therefore assumes the date atne. 726, which 1 believe to be much too

s late.

 

Horace pretends to lay before the old lawyer a ease for his opinion, and asks what
he had better do to meet the malevolenee of his enemioe. Trebatius advises him to
ωηο. from writing‚ which Horace says is impossible. He was born to write, and must
do it. He has no capacity for heroic sulfiects, and has a passion for imitating Lucilius,
{aowhom he pays a graeeful complimeut by the way. Trebatius warns him that he

. nnn-he risk of being frozen maeath by his greatfi-iends, or of legal pennam for

 

libel. But trusting in the gooduess of his cause Horace sets these dangers at defianee,
and resolves to indulge his inclinatiou. It is not easy to suppose that a satire written
in this annin was quite the last that Horace composed3 aud it might be supposed, not
