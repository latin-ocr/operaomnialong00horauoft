“ Demetri,''—puer hie non laeve jussa Philippi
Accipiebat—“ abi, quaere et refer, unde domo, quis,
Cujus fortunae, quo sit patre quove patr0n0.’'

It, redit et narrat, Volteium nomine Menam,

did not rank him among the first mamm,
but still there was much to admire 111
him: his speech was free, his wit abun-
dant3 he was inventive‚ and perspicuous‚
and elever in repartee; and elsewhere 118
calls him “ suavis orator, gravis, facetus”
(Brut. 50).

47. octavam circiter horam] This is
Martial's description of the distribution
of a Roman's day :—The first and second
honrs were given to the ‘salutatio‚’ or
reccptiou of clients and visitors. At the
third hour the courts opened and business
went on for three hours. The sixth hour
was given up to rest (and the ‘pran-
dium'), the seventh to winding up busi-
ness, the eighth to exercise, and with the
ninth began dinner. (Mart. iv. 8.)

48. Foro nimium distare Carina-5] The
Carinae was 011 the north side of the Via
Sacra, under Mons Esquilinus, oceupying
part of the fourth and third quarters of
the city, though the greater part of it
was in the fourth, corresponding, Nax-dini
supposes, with that part which is now
called Pantani; but that part of the
Carinae which was in the third quarter
,comprised the spot on which afterwards
was built the. Colosseum, and which was
distinguished by the name of Ceriolensis.
The Carinae contained the houses of
many persons of distinction, among whom
we re ι(1 of Sp. Cassius (whose house was

pulled down after he had been put to
death), Cn. Pompeius (afterwards occu-
pied by M. Antonius), of Tiberius (Suet.
-Tib- c. 15), of Μ’ Manilius (Cic. Parad. vi.
c. 3), of Balbinus, and of this Philippus.
The temples of Concordia and Tellus were
in the same part. The fai-thest part of
the Carinae could not have been above
three-quarters of a mile from the Forum
Romanunm but Philippus was old. Ho-
race means to show that he was inclined
to be peevish, being tired with his work
in the Forum; and in this splenetic
humour 118 fell in with the man Mena,

55

whose easy enjoyment of life made a
strong impression upon him. It made
him jealous, and 118 resolved to sp 011 1115
independence if he could.

50. Adrasum quendam] The MSS. and
editions vary between ‘'adrasum and

‘abrasu1n.' [‘ Adrasum' means ‘close
shaved ;' not, ‘ with 1115 hair cropped
short,' as Ritter supposeS, that it might
not 118 necessary to come often and pay
his money.] The man had just been
shaved and was paring and cleaning his
nails leisurely (‘ proprios purgantem un·
gues ';) he did not employ the barber for
this operation, as people were in the habit
of doing. The shop was empty [or at
least, not full], because those who would
come for business came early, and those
who came to lounge came later (S. i. '7- 3).
‘Umbra,’ which here means a shop, is
used for different kinds of buildingsb
the poets, as a ‘porticus’ and a school:
See Juvenal (vii. 173): “Ad pugnam qui
rhetorica. descendit ab umbra.'' [⁶ Vacua
tonsoris umbra est arboris ad domum ton·
soris positae umbra, quae nullo alio sessore
tunc occupata erat. Unde facilius seden-
tem advertit Philippus-³ Ritter. This is
certainly a false interpretation. ‘ Umbra’
may be an awning, and the shop-front
was probably opem]

53. unde domo] This phrase, which 15
equivalent to ‘ a qua domo,’ occurs in Vir·
gil (Aen. viii. 114): “Qui genus? unde
domo ?” which Heyne explains by τίνες τὸ
’γένος ; πόθεν (for ποίας) adv-pan Philip-
pus sends to know who the man is, where
118 8011185 from, whether he is rich or poor,
if ‘ingenuus,' who is his fat-heu if a
freedman‚ who 15 1115 ‘ patronus. ’

55. Volteium nomine Menam]
man is represented as a freedman of some
person of the Volteia gens. L. Volteius‚ a
friend of L. Metellus, is mentioned· 111 Cic.

The

in Ver. ii. 3. 66. A freedman took the
gentile name of his master ou 1115 manu-
mission. The name Mena is akin to
