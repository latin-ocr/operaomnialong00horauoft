HORATII FLACCI

Aut herba lapathi prata amantis et gravi
Malvae salubres corpori,
Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,

Vel haedus ereptus lupo.

60

Has inter epulas ut juvat pastas oves
Videre properantes domum,

Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves
Collo trahentes languido,

Positosque vernas, ditis examen domus,

65

Circum renidentes Lares !
Haec ubi locutus fenerator Alphius,
J am jam futurus rusticus,
Omnem red'egit Idibus pecuniam,
Quaerit Kalendis ponere.

moor-fowl. Martial says it was one of their
most delicious birds (xiii. 61) :—

“ Inter sapores fertur alitum primus
Ionicarum gustus attagenarum.”

’ It is repeatedly mentioned by Aristopha-
neg-7· Aut herba lapathi] Both the ‘ lapa-
thum’ and the ⁶ malva’ were gently pur-
ssffiffi'- See Sat. ii. 4. 29 and Mart. x.

‘¹ Exoneraturas ventrem mihi villica malvas
Attulit.”

59. caesa Terminalibus] The 'sermi-
nalia took place in the early spring (23
February), about the time of lambing‚ and
lambs were offered to Terminus. Plutarch
says that sheep rescued from the jaws of
the wolf were thought to be better fla-
voured than others. The thrifty would
eat them for economy. That is the idea
Horace means to convey. Martia] intro-
duces the same dish to make a. plain mcal
(x. 48. 13) :—

 

Una ponetur caenula mensa
Haedus inhumani raptus ab ore lupi.”

Porphyrion explains Horace’s meaning by
saying “ factus gratior ex perdito.'’

61. ut juvat] See v. 19, “ ut gaudet?

65. vernas, ditis examen domus] “ Tur-
baque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni '¹
(Tibull. ii. 1. 23). ‘ Verna' was a slave
born in the owner's house. There was a
hcarth near which the images of the Lares
were placed, in the centre of the ‘atrium,’
the entrance-mom, and round it the slaves
had their supper. Columella (xi. 1. 19,

quoted by Cruquius) says: “ Consuescet
(villicus) rusticos circa. Larem domini fo-
cumque familiarem semper epulari.” Max·-
tial (iii. 58. 22) has :—

“ Cingunt serenum lactei focum vernae
Et larga festos lucet ad Lares silva,’'

which favours the notion that ‘renidentes’
means shining by the light of the fite,
although Orelli says it does not. ¹ Cheer-
sul' is the sense. Rutgersius refers'the
word to ‘ νει-11118] and Doering partly ap-
proves. The sense derived from J uvenal's
description (xii. 88), “simulacra nitentia
cera,'' does not suit this passage. ⁷

67. Haec ubi loeutus] MancinellL who
was an acute as well as learned man, sup·
poses Horace to mean, that on hearing him
declaim upon the chal-ms of the country
the usui-er determined to be a farmer, and
he understands ‘ sum' atter ‘locutus.’
Though no doubt he is wrong, he saw that
a good deal of the language and sentimenta
of this ode was unsuited to Alphius. H.
Stephens notices the same interpretation.
A usurer of this name is mentioned by
Columella (i. ’7. 2) as an authority on the
subject of bad deth. ‘ Redigere’ (not
‘religere,' as the Scholiasts and some of
the older editors have it) is the technical
word for getting in money out on loan,
and ‘ ponere’ for putting it out, as κατα-
βάλλειν, βάλλειν, τιθέναι. The settling
days at Rome were the Kalends, Nones,
and Ides. See Cicero, Div. in Q. Caecil.
17 3 also in Verr. (ii. 1. c. 57), “Nemo Ra-
bonio molestus est neque Kalendis Decem·
bribus neque Nonis neque Idibus.” [Sat.
i. 3. 87.]
