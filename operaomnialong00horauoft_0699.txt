were 11011 known to Cicero, who s of
him 03 “vafer ille Siculus Epicharmus”
(ad Att. i. 19. 8), “astutus nec insulsus
homo” (Tusc. Disp- i. 8). Aristotle(Poet.
c. 5) says that Epicharmus and Phormis
11010 the inventors of comedy. Bentley
(Epp- of Phalaris,p .199) takes the fact to
be that the comedies of Epicharmus were
the first that were written. [⁶ Ad exem·

comic poet was born at Mediolanum (Mi-
1011).Ηο was a slave, and while 111 that
condition received the name of Statius

His contemporaries held him in high esti-
mation. According to the text of Sueto-
nius' life of Terence as it now stands,
Caecilius was the person to whom Terence
was directed by the Aediles to carry
Andria for his jyudgment. He found him
,at dinner, and because he was shabbily
dressed 110 was directed to sit down on a
stool and read what he had got. Aster he
had read a few verses Caecilius was 3ο
struck with what he had heard, that he
made the author come to table among the
guests and finish his play. This anecdote
shows Caecilius’ position. Cicero places
him, not without some hesitation, at the
head of the comic poets(sup. v. 5611..)

110 accounts for by 1113 intercourse with
Laelius and the younger Scipio Africanus,
by both of whom Terence was supposed to
have been assisted in writing his plays:

“licet Terentii scripta ad Scipionem Afri·
canum referantur, quae tamen suntin 1100
genere elegantissima'’ (Quintil. x. 1. 100).

“Terentium cujus fabellae propter elegan-
tiam sermonis putabantur a C. Laelio
scribi’' (Cic. ad Att. vii. 3. 10). Donatus, in
his life of Terence, quotes the authorities
of Q„ Memmius, the orator, and Nepos for
the same fact ς 01111 110 himself alludes to it
as a matter mst in his teeth by his adver-
saries, but as one of which, if it were true,
he should have more reason to be proud
than ashamed. (Prologus

to Adelph. aud
Heautont.)

But there is no patchwork in
Terence’s plays. No help he could have
had from any one would account for the
uniform elegance of language, pathos, good
taste, wit, and humorous pictures of real
life and nature, that appear ughout his
writings. Afranius (in Suetonius? life,
