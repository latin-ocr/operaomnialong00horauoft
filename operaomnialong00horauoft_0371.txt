120. On’aepn'ni serinia lippi] Crispinus
serves as a deus ex machina, and helps
Horace to bring his homily to an end.
But we know nothing about him. The
fm-tility of his pen, as Estre observes,
has profited him nothing. He was more

made mirth for the rich. They were kept
hythe wealthy to amuse them as the court
fools of later days. In this character
Crispinus appears in the third Sntire of
this book (v. 139), where he is the only
attendant of the would ·‘be rex.’ Crispi-

Horace (says he) was himself affiicted with
sore eyes, and he was not so wanting in
decency as to ridicule another person for ·

anxious to write much than to write -that defect. This argument against all

well. (S. i.4. 14). The Scholiasts
say he was called ‘oguaretal s,' and
that he wrote verses on the Stoic doc-
trines. sse word ‘aretalogus' occurs

for the mental blindness which, as Cru-

means to charge upon Crispinus. See
