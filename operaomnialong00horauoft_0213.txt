Sospitam. Vos, 0 pueri et puellae

‘puellae' is not true· and his way of ac-
counting for Horace having written* ex-
pertae: whereas the masculine would be
required for his interpretation, will not
satisfy many, neither' 15 it very intelligible.
‘Virum expertae’ is clearly equivalent to
‘nuper virgines nuptae’ (C. ii. 8. 22).
‘Male ominatis' may be pronounced 85

[Ritter 1185 ‘male nominatis: for which
there is good MSS. authority 3 but it is 8
badreading.] Bentley proposes ‘inomina-
tis? All the Scholiasts have ‘ominatis,'
and some of the best MSS.

14. eaeimet] Orelli’s B 1185 *0113013 but
all his other MSS. have ‘eximet,' and Ι do
not find the other reading quoted by J ani
or Fen. Iu C. iv. 15. 18, the MSS. vary
more, though the majority and best have

‘eximet ’ there likewise. Orelli makes this
distinction, that ‘ exigere ' is more 89910-
priate to express the violent expulsion of a
good thing, 85 18 the above passage; ‘ex-
imet,’ which he has here, for the quiet 10-
moval of 88 evil: but he is almost inclined,
out of deference to his MS. B, tocontradict
himself, and read ‘ exiget' here. ‘ Eximet'
is 8 better word, Ι think, in this place, and
⁴ exiget' in the other.

-—— tumultum Nec mori per vim] ‘'ru-
multus’ and ‘vis’ are well-distinguished
ter-ms. When some would have softened
the terms of the decree of the senate against
M. Antonius by substituting the word ‘tu-
multum ' for ‘ bellum‚' Cicero told them
they did not know the meaning of the
words: “ Potest enim esse bellum sine tu-
multu, tumultus esses 51110 bello non potest.
Quid est enim tumult-us nis i perturbatio
tanta ut major timor oriatur r unde etiam
nomen ductum est tumultus. Itaque ma-
jores nostri tumultum Italicum, quod erat
domesticus; tumultum Gallicum quod erat
Italiae finitimum praeterea nullum nomi·
nebant. Gravius autem tumultum esse
quam bellum hinc intelligi lice't quod bello
vacationes valent, tumultu nou valent.'’
