CARMINUM Iv. 1. · 219

 

Et quandoque potentior
Largi muneribus riserit aemuli,
Albanos prope te lacus .
Ponet marmoream sub trabe citrea. 20
Illic plurima naribus
Duces tura, lyraeque et Berecyntiae
Delectabere tibiae
Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula;
Illic bis pueri die 25
Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum
Laudantes pede candido
In morem Salium ter quatient humum.
Me nec femina nec puer
Jam nec spes animi credula mutui, 30
Nee certare juvat mero
Nee vincire novis tempora fioribus.
Sed cur heu, Ligurine, cur
Manat rara meas laeruma per genas ?
cur facunda parum decoro 35
Inter verba eaditlingua silentio ¹?
Nocturnis ego somniis
J am captum teneo, jam volucrem sequor
Te per gramina Martii
Campi, te per aquas, dure, volubiles. 40
