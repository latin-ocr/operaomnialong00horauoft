HORATII FLACCI

Indocti stolidique, et depugnare parati

Si discordet eques, media inter carmina poscunt

185

Aut ursum aut pugiles ; his nam plebecula plaudit.
Verum equitis quoque jam migravit ab aure voluptas
Omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana.

Quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas,

Dum fugiunt equitum turmae peditumque catervam

190

Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis,
Esseda festinant, pilenta, petorrita, naves,

185. Si discordet eques] See S. i. 10.
’16 n.

186. Aut wrsum aab pugiles] Augustus
himself had a liking for boxers (Epp. i. 1.
49n..) The interruptions to the regular
drama which Horace here mentions appear
to have been of common occurrence. Te-
rence complains that the representation of
the Hecyra was interrupted in this way
(Prol. 25). At that time the plays were
represented on a temporary platform in
the circus, where also gladiators and shows
of wild beasts were exhibited (Epp. i. 1.
6n.). An amphitheatre for the purpose
of wild-beast shows was built for the first
time by Statilius Taurus in A.U.o. 725 in
the Campus Martius (Suet. Aug. 29). The
beasts were hunted by dogs or fought by
men. But though the acting of plays was
in Horace’s time carried on in a theatre
(v. 60 11.) erected for this special purpose,
it appears that the people insisted some-
times on having a bear-hait or a boxing
match there to amuse them, in spite of the
remonstrances of the equites in the front
rOWS, who however, Horace says, were
themselves taken too much with proces-
sions and shows that appealed inore to the
eye than to the ear. [‘ Plaudit :' ‘ gaudet?
Ritter, Kriiger3 the true reading]

187. Verum equitis] Here Bentley,
‘satis pro imperio’ as Orelli says, and
‘ frustra reclamantibus librariis? ashe says
himself, substitutes ‘ equiti’ for ‘ equitis '
against all the MSS. Also on his own
conjecture he substitutas ‘ingratos' for
‘incertos' in the next verse: “ingratos
vero oeulos vocat quod cito voluptatis obli-
viscantur nullumque ex ea fructum perci-
piant aut reddant? The eye is easily
dazzled and deluded. The ear takes iu
what it receives and conveysit to the mind
without err0r3 and though Horace seems
elsewhere to commend the eye as a means
of instruction above the ear, the case is
different. (A. P. 180 n.). Cicero, writing
to M. Marius (ad Fam. vii. 1. 2), speaks

with contempt of the representatione at
the opening of the theatre of Cn. Pom-
peius, in which he says: “Apparatus
spectatio tollebat omnem hilaritatem. —
Quid enim delectationi s habent sexcenti
muli m Clytaemnestra Ρ (a play of Attius)
aut in Equo Trojano (a play of Livius)
craterarum tria millia, aut armatura varia
peditatus et equitatus in aliqua pugna?
quae popularem admirationem habue-
Eunt, delectationem tibi nullam attu-
‘ssent.'’

189. aulaea premuntwr] At the back
of the stage was the ‘seena‚' or wall on
which was painted some scene suitable to
the performance. Before this ‘ scena ’ was
a curtain, which was let down (premuntur)
below the stage when the acting began,
and raised (tolluntur) when it was over.
This curtain was called ‘aulaeum.' The
raising of the curtain at the end of the
play is referred to in A. P. 154 :—

“ Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et
sepssgge donec cantor,
dicat.'’

[Compare Ovid, Met. iii. 11,

“Sic, ubi tolluntur festis aulaea theatris,
Surgere signa solent, primumque osten-
dere vultum,
Caetera paulatim, placidoque educta
Tolffaenffissen} imoque pedes in margine
γ ponun

191. reyum fortuna] This‘ rs equivalent
‘fortunati reges? Th e expression is
like those noticed at S. i. 2. 32, ii. 1. 72.
192. Esseda festinant] The ‘’essedum
was originally the name of a British or
Graulish‘³ war char-iot, derived from a Celtic
root. The name was also applied to a
travelling carriage on two wheels and
drawn by two horses. The ‘pilentum'
was a carriage used in processione, and
appears to have been of a luxurious kind,
