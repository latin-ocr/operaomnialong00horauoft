(Epodv.99)n. ‘Cadmus’ issaidbyall
the Scholiasts to have been a public exe·
cutioner of that day: “carnifex notae
erudelitatis³³ (Acron). There is another
reading, which is adopted by landinus
(Ven. 1483)‘ camo: to which he adds the
uote‘ ‘species vinculi estJ’ Constantine,
in his Greek lexicon, under the word
κῆμος, recommends the word‘ camo 'her-e,
aud it occurs in one of Cruquius’ MSS.
Landinus must also havehad it in his;
but it appears to be only an error of the
transcribet. Constantine's interpretation
obrimus—that it was a sort of bit put into
the mouth of a slave by way of punishment
-if correct, would prove that the word
has no place here, since Horace is speaking
of the punishment of citizens, not of slavoe.
Estre rather favours ‘Camo.' Gruquius
‘Bathmo’ to represent the Gemo-
niae, the declivity from which the bodies
of malefactor-s were thrown aster their
execution. I have an im on that
‘’Cadmo is not the right word3 but Ι do
not feel disposed to adopt eith’er of the

supposed to be addroesed in the previous
lines, affirms that if his birth is low, that
of his colleague Novius (who may be any
body ς see note on S. 3. 21) is still lower.
Freedmen and persons following low trades
were admitted into the senate by C. Julius
Caemr, audit was not till some years aster
this Satire was written that Augustus
purged the senate of these members. 'the
words ‘gradu post me sedet nno’ are not
easily interpreted. Cruquius' Scholiast
explains them of the fourteen first rows
at the theatre which were assigned to the
equites (Epod.' w. 15 n.)‘ ‘in quatuordecim ’
gradibus equestris dignitatis sedet uno
