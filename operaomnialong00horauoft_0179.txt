Augustus, and the spseeh is not destitute os such oratorie-1 power aa the ease admitted
of. lt alno omnim indireet exhortatione to abstinent-e and eontenttnent, and so bears
on the general scope of these odes. Suetonius, in his life of C. Julius Caesar (c. 79),
mys it wne generally reported he meant to transfer the seat of empire to Alexandria
(nn'huaspmbably, not the Egyptian city) or to Ilium. Lucan ascribes to him the
nme ἰιιῦοιιὸοιι, and makes him say (ix. 997),
“Restituam populos: grata viee moenia reddent
Ausonidae Phrygibus, Romanaque Pergama snrgent.'’

Μ such was really the ease or not, it appears that at the timesucha transfer was

ι me considered too absurd to be spoken of. We know that the abandonmeut of the

mother city for Veiirhad its advocates, who were not influenced solely by the superior

’ · atu-setium ottho city, but by <linire ιο the institutione of Rome and to hm which 00qu

only be got rid of by zucha change, Weean easily believe that in Horaee's time among
the remedies proposed for the evils of the state some may have freely spoken of traus-
flerring the seat of government to another spot, and that the site of Troy, the city of
tbn‘r supposed amem-s and the fountain of their race, may have been fixed upon for
that purpose. To meet the spirit of avariee in some, and restlessness in all that would
be mixed up 'with such a notion, seems to have been Horaee's purpose. One of Orelli’s
Barna HSS. has this inscription, “Ad Musas de Augusto qui in proposito videtur

² ’ · mmm? aa if Augustus had entertained a desire and intention like the above, and

 

someeommentators have taken up that notion. If it had been the ense, there is no
likelihood that Horace would have taken this oeeasion and means of dissuading him.
1 believe as 1 said before, he wrote these odes, if not by the emperor's desire, to second
his effoth, and with his approval.

Justin desa-ibes the meeting of the Roman soldiers with the people of the Troad,
when Scipio lauded in Asia in his expedition against Antiochus: “Cum igitur ab
auique bellum pararetur ingressique Asiam Romani Ilium venissent, mutua gratulatio
ninnium ae Romanorum fuit ; Iliensibus Aeneam ceterosque cnm eo duces a se
prefectos, Romanis se ab his procreatos referentibus3 tantaque laetitia omnium fuit
quant- eoee post longum tempus inter parentes et liberos solet. Juvabat Ilienses
nepotes snos Occidente et Africa domita Asiam ut avitum regnum vindieare, optabilem
{uqi-s ruinam fuisse dieentes, ut tam feliciter renaseeretur: contra Romanos avitos

ARGUM ENT.

The upright man and firm no terr-ors can drive from his purpose. Throngh this virtue
Pollux, Hercules, Augustus, Bacchus, have been translated to the skies. Romulus
likewise, at the instance of Juno, who thus addressed the assembled gods : “ Ilium
bath paid the penalty of the founder's crime. 'rhat impious umpire and his foreign
strumpet bave overthrown it. But his beauty is gone 3 Priam’s perjured house hath
fallen 3 the war our quarrels protracted is at an end. My wrath then Ι remit. Let
Mars have my hated grandson, let him come among us: only let sees roll between Ilium
and Rome, and let the exiles reign where they will ; let their Capitol stand, and the

But hold, my Ense, nor bring down such themes to the spor-tire lyre.
