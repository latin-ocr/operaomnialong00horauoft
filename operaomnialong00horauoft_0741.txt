Vicinas urbes alit et grave sentit aratrum,
Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis
Doctus iter melius, mortalia facta peribunt,
Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.

Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque

- Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,
Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.
Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella
Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.

Versibus impariter junctis querimonia primum,

n pooeible. The canal extended from Porum
Appii to Terracina, which is said to have
been the length of the marshes at that time.
Horace· to be speculating upon a
work which, though often attempted, has
never succeeded. For a history of these
attenupts see Penny Cyclopaedia (art.
⁸ Pmnptine Marshes ’).

67. 82- cnms· meana] The Scholiasts
say this refers to the divining of the Vela-
brum (S. ii. 8. 229) by Agrippa. But Fen
has diown this to be an error. The Vela·
brum was draincd by Tarquinius Priscus,
or whoever built the eloam Maxima (Livy
i. 38), and was occupied by considerable
buildings before the time of Augus

ns that Augustus ‘⁴ ad coemendas inunda-
tione alveum Tiberis laxavit, completum
olim ruderibus et aedificiorum prolapsi-

onibus coarctatum'' (c. 30). [Horace
⁷ seems to mean generally that a river's
ι course lna been changed. ]

68. Doctuitermelius] So itissaidof
the river in Ep p.p i. 14. 29.

69. Noa-m :emonam etet Itonos] This
construction Professor Key explains by snp-
posing the verb ‘ existumes' understood for
the sake of brevity. (L. G. 1228.)

71. εἰ volet nus] See Epp. ii. 2. 119 n.
Hor-ace uses the words in the next verse
without reference to their technical dis-
tinction. ‘ J us.' in one of its senses, wasa
rule of law (Epp. i. 16. 41). ‘Norma' a

ter's or mason’s square. The decid-

j ι ing, ordering, and shaping of words is all

that Horace means.

’ ⁷5. Versibus impariter junctis queri·
⁸ Impariter’ is not used elsewhere.
What orace here calls ‘querimonia’ is
ἐλεγεῖα Omma-ly, ‘mourning for the
dead? 'nie oldest writer in this measure
that we know is Callinus of Ephesus, who
appears to have lived during the greater
part of the seventh century sc. (Mulier,

Lit. ofGreece, p. 109.) His poetry. like
that of Tyrtaeus of Attica. was of a martial
order. Archilochus of Paros was nearly
contem with these. He too calls
himself θεράπων Ἐνναλίσω ἄνακτος (Fr. l.

Bergk). Ee lost first his reputation (by
running away) and aflzerwards his life, in
battle. His elegiae verses were convivial as
well as wax-like. He also wrote elegies for
the dead. Asius of Samos was contempo-
rary with the above, and these are the
earliest writers in the elegiae metre- It was
therefore of Ionian origin, whichever of
these poete first employed it. That ques*
tion which was not settled in Horace’s day

tus, -is not likely to be settled now. The next

elegiae poet in order of time was Mimner-
mus, also an Ionian (Epp. i. 6.65; ii. 2. 101
ιι.). His verses were chiefly of the erotic
order, which is referred to in v. ¹76. The
political and gnomic elegies of Solon and
Theognis (some of whose poems were con·
vivial) coms next, but Theognis morethan
half a century later than Solon: and con-
temporary with him, or a little older, was
Xenophanes, the founder of the moetic
school of philosophy, whose verses, as far
as we know, were of the sympesiac order
without being very conducive to mirth.
The great master of threnetic poetry was
Simonides of Ceos, the contemporary and
rival of Aeschylus. “The elcgy in the
hands of different masters sometimes at-
tained a soster and more wthetic, and
sometimes a more manly and robust tone.
Nevertheless there is no reason for dividing
the eleg) ·into different kindz, such as the
military, political, symposiac, erotic, thae-
netic, and ς inasmuch as some of
these characters are at times combined in
the same poem. Thus the elegy wasusnally
sung at the symposium, and' ιιι most cases
its main subject is politic-11, aster which it
assumes either an amatory, a plaintive,
or a sententious tone. At the same time
the elegy always retains its appropriate
