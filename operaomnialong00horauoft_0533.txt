Sunt quorum ingenium nova tantum crustula promit.
Nequaquam satis in re una consumere curam,

Ut si quis solum hoc mala ne sint vina laboret, x

Massica si caelo suppones vina sereno,
Nocturna si quid crassi est tenuabitur aura,
Et decedet odor nervis inimicus3 at illa
Integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem.
