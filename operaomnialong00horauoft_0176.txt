HORATII FLACCI

ANGUSTAM amice pauperiem pati
Robustus acri militia puer

Condiscat, et Parthos feroces
Vexet eques metuendus hasta,

Vitamque sub divo et trepidis agat
Illum ex moenibus hosticis

In rebus.

Matrona bellantis tyranni
Prospiciens et adulta virgo
Suspiret‚ eheu, ne rudis agminum

Sponsus lacessat regius asperum

Tactu leonem, quem cruenta
Per medias rapit ira caedes,
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori z
Mors et fugacem persequitur virum,

Nec parcit imbellis juventae

1. amice] Some MSS„ which Lambinus
and Bentley follow, read ‘amici ;' and the
ancient title ‘ad amicos’ shows that the
Grammarians who first affixed that title
had ‘amici’ before them. And Acron says,
“ Hanc oden generaliter ad amicos scribit
commonens‚'' ἕω. But Horaee’s advice is
addresscd to the young, as he shows not
only in the introductory stanza of the first
ode, but in the opening also of thisj ‘ Amice
ferre' is plainly the reverse of ‘ moleste
ferre,' and corresponds to ‘elementer’ in
Cicero’s letter to Atticus (vi. 1. 3): “Gnaeus
noster clementer id fert'' (the loss of his
money). “ Ferendum est molliter sapienti'’
is another form of expression for the same
bll'efid‘rhliffegffscnottengteildgdtby? inoelrlliiii? νῖᾏῗὲ
probably read ‘ amici-³ 1 observe he'chiefly
used Lambinus' Horace. ‘Militia,' in the
next verse, may depend either on ‘robustus'
or ‘condiscat.'

3. Parthos seroces]
nere'' (Acron).

5. sub divo et trepidis] Doering omits
‘et' against all MSS. and editions, to the
injury of the verse and sense. ‘ Et’ is
wanted to couple ‘trepidis rebus' with ‘di-
vo‚’ as ‘que’ couples ‘vitam agat ' with
‘ Parthos vexet?

6. Illum ea: moenibus] This picture, re-
presenting the fears of the Parthian mother
and maiden, the danger of the son and
lover, and the prowess of the Roman soldier,
has been much commended. Itis not in
Horace’s usual style, and is perhaps better

“Species pro ge-

suited to an ode addressed to the young
than to any other. To them it might be
inspiring, but hardly to older minda.
Helen, looking out with her damsels from
the walls of Troy (11. iii. 139 sqq.)‚ or the
description of Hoeiod (Scut. Herc. 242),—

αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἐῢδμήτων ἐπὶ

 

χάᾞείζΐν ὀξὺ βόων κατὰ δ’ ἐδρύπτοντο

παρειάς,

or Antigone Iooking from the walls of
Thebes (Eurip. Phoen. 88), were perhaps
before Horace’s mind.

13. Dulce et decorum est] In Horace's
mind there was a close connexion between
the virtue of frugal contentment and de-
votion to one’s country. They are asso-
ciated below (C. iv. 9. 49 sqq.).

14. persequitur] In this word is oon-
tained all thatBentley would gain by chang-
ing it against the MSS. to ‘consequitur-,³
and it is more graphio. The line is a trans-
lation from Simonides (65 Bergk),— ⁵

ὁ δ’ αὖ θάνατος κίχε καὶ τὸν φυγόμαχᾰν.

Horace may have seen Tyrtaeus' elegy (7
Bergk), which begins—

τεθνάμεναι γὰρ καλὸν ἐν) προμάχοισι
πεσόντα
ἄνδρ’ ἀγαθὸν περὶ ᾖ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον.

‘Persequi' signifies ‘to pursue and over-
take? Bentley prefers ‘ ve’ to ‘que‚’ with
‘timida’ [There is better authority for
‘ timidove? which Ritter and Keller have]
