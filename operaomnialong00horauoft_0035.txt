INTRODUCTION. uxi

C. i. 6.-'rhis metre consiste of three Asclepiadem verses, such as
C. 1, aud a Glyconeam as in C. 3. In C. i. 15. 24 and 36 a trochee
occurs in the first foot (see note). ΤῙιε other Odes are i. 24, 33 ; ii. 12;
iii. 10, 16; iv. 5, 12.

C. i. 7.—This measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyric poet
of Sparta. It consists of two verses, of which the first is a complete
hexameter, and the second is made up of the four last feet of an
hexameter. To this belong C. i. 28, and Epod. xii.

C. i. 8.·-—There is no other Ode in this metrc, which also consists of
two verses. The first consiste of a dactyl and two trochees, or a trochee
and spondee, ,- υ υ Ι - υ Ι -, ε. This takes its name from Aristo-
phanes. The second is a verse, of which the first half consiste of two

¹wochees and a dactyl, with a long syllable added, and the second half

is the first reversed, thus:

-υΙ-εΙ-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υΙ-ε

Horace always has a spondee in the second place.

¹C'. i. 9.-This is the ordinary Alcaic metre, in which each stanza
consiste of four verses. The first two are divided thus=

zl-ul-ul-uul—u:

- though Horace usually substitutes a spondee for the second troehee,

the only exception being iii. 5. 17. The caesura usually falls after the
fifth syllable, to which rule exceptions will be found in C. i. 16. 21, 37;
5, 143 ii. 17. 21 ς iv. 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did not observe.
The first syllable of the verse is more commonly long than short. It
is usual to look upon the first part of the verse as iambic, and to divide
it thus:
z - Ι υ - Ι - Ι·

But 1 have no doubt it is trochaic. The third verse is also trochaiQ
consisting of a syllable (usually long) followed by four trochees, a

spondee being substituted by Horace for the second trochee. sse
fourth verse consiste of two dactyls and two trochees.

C. i. 11.—This is an Asclepiadean metre, rather peculiar. The

*division to which we are guided by the ear seems to separate each

verse into three parts, as follows:

ν This classes it with the ἀσυνάρτητα. Those who resort to the division

by choriambi desti-oy the natural rhythm. To this· belong i. 18;
iv. 10.
