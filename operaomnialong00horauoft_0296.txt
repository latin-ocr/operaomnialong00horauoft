HORATII FLACCI CARMINUM IV. 15.

Virtute functos more patrum duces

Lydis remixto carmine tibiis

Trojamque et Anchisen et almae
Progeniem Veneris canemus.

29. Virtute functos] This is a concise
way of expressing ‘virtutis munere func-
tos,' as in Cicero (Tusc. i. 45): “Nemo
parum diu vixit qui virtutis perfectae per-
fecto functus est munere.”

—- more patrum] Cic. (Tusc. i. 2, and
iv. 2) tells us that in the Origines of Cato
it is stated that it was the eustom of old to
sing songs at their meals upon the virtues
of great men. Valerius Maximus (ii. 1. 10)
refers to the same custom: “Majores nostri
in conviviis ad tibias egregia superiorum
ἓὲθζῖῗξῖῗῖἲέηἳιᾝἣῗῗέἓέἔιξῖἕὲιῖᾚὸὲθᾚ
redderent? The practice may have been
partially revived in Horace's day. The
conclusion of this ode recalls C. iv. 5. 31
s .

q30. Lydis] Plato (de Rep. 3. 10, p. 398,
» Ε) tells us that the Lydian and Ionian
melodies were best suited to delicacy and
feasting‚ the Dorian and Phrygian to war3
and Aristotle is of opinion that they (the
Lydizm) were most suitable to the tender

age of boyhood, as harmonizing the mind
and trairiing it to good. There is no par-
ticular force, however, here in the word
‘ Lydis? It should be observed, that when
‘ tibia’ appears in the plural number (C. i.
1. 32 3 Epod. ix. 5) it hnsreference to two
of these instrumente played by one person.
Their pitch was different, the low-pirched
tibia being called ‘dextra5' because it was ,
held in the right hand3 the high ‘sinistram
because it was held in the lest. The pipes
used by the Lydians themselves are called
by Herodotus (i. 17) αὐλὸς ἄνδρήῖος and
αὐλὸς γυναικήῖος, as representing the voices
of a man and a woman respectively. This
interpretation has been doubted, however,
and it is the opinion of some that the

The family of Anchises, the grandfather of
Iulus, ιε mentioned here, because Augustus
belonged to the Julian family, of which
Iulus was the reputed founder.
