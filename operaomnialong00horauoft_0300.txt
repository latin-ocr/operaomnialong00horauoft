lent in Latin ; it is therefore no proof that
Horace used the Greek form iu the one
case because he did so in the other, as
Bentley affirms. Besides which it would
seem that the, Latin names are purposely
introduced in contrast to the Greek.
‘ Producas’ here signifies ‘to rear’ as in
C. ii. 13. 3. The ‘lex J ulia de maritandis
ordinibus’ is referred to in the fifth stanza.
See C. iv. 15. 10. [Ritter interprets ‘ de-
creta super jugandis feminis' as a reference
to the ‘Lex J ulia de adulteriis ;’ and he

This is a mistake. ‘Jugare’ means ‘to
marry.’ Ritter observes that the chorus
of boys sing the fifth stanza, which it was
proper for them to sing, and not the vir-
gins. But if the virgins understood it as
he does, it would not be decent for the
boys to sing it or for the girls to hear it.]
21. Certus undenos] The notion that
the Saecular Games were celebrated every
110 years, which seems to have been the
length of a saeculum as measured by the
Etruscans, was a fiction invented probably
at this time. There is no trace of their
having been so celebrated either before or
aster Augustus. They lasted three days
and nights. They were celebrated by
Claudius AD. 47, and again by Domitian.
25. veraces cecinisse] A great deal of
difficulty has been raised respecting the
meaning of this stanza, and the reading,
which in the MSS. varies between ‘dictum
est’ and ‘dictum’ without ‘oetss ‘ servat '
and ‘servet.’ Bentley has increased the
trouble of commentators in attempting to
lighten it by the substitution of ‘stabilis
per aevum' for ‘stabilisque rerum' and

omitting ‘ est? The great majority of
MSS. read ‘ est ' and ‘servet 3' the mean-
ing in that case being made plain by sup-
posing ‘ stabilis-servet' to be parenthe-
tical: ‘ ye Parcae who tell truly what has
once been determined (and may the fixed
order of events preserve it so),’ not as Dill.
explains, ‘ye Parcae who truly prophesy,
add good destinies to those that we have
known, according to that which has once
been deolared and which may‚' Soc. ‘Ve-
races cecinisse ' cannot properly stand
alone, particularly with ‘ quod' imme-
diately following. But ‘servat’ (which,
however, has little authority from the
MSS.) appears to be the simplet· reading,
for ‘quod’ does not 111 this case, as Bentley
states, require the subjunctive mood. Sup-
posing ‘servat' to be the reading, Horace
merely states a fact, that the Parcae truly
foretold the destined
which, once for all decreed, the course of
events was daily confirming. I agree with
Orelli in prefer-ring this reading, which
Lambinus also preferred, though he
adopted ‘servet.’ ‘ Semel,’ 111 the sense
of ‘once for an’ (καθάπαξ), is common.
The Parcae could not but be true expo·
nents of the decr-ees (fata) of Jove, since
to them their execution was entrusted.
Ther'e maybe some inconsistency in askiug
them to give good fates to Rome, since
they could only executa ministerially ‘ quod ,
semel dictum est?

[31. aquae salubres] ‘ Healthgiving
rains? Comp. C. iii. 1. 31.]

33. Condito mitis placidusque telo] On
the promontory near Actium there was a
statue of Apollo with his bow bent and n
fierce aspect, which was an object of terror

greatness of Rome
