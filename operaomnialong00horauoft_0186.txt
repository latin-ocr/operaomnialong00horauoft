HORATII FLACCI

Visam Britannos hospitibus feros
Et laetum equino sanguine Concanum,
Visam pharetratos Gelonos 35
Et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.
Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
Fessas cohortes addidit oppidis,
Finire quaerentem labores
Pierio recreatis antro. 40

can Sea is an unusual limitation. It must
not be confounded with Mare Siculum.
Palinurus on the western coast of Lucania
is Capo di Palinuro.

31. urentes] There is a reading ‘aren-
tes.’ Acron read ‘ urentes,’ as it appears,
Four of Orelli's best MSS„ with the Leiden
of the tenth century, have the same. He
prefers it as less otiose, and because all
sands are dry, but all do not burn as the
Syrian beach does. There is not much in
this argument. The participle of a tran-

· sitive verb is not commonly used as an

epithet by Horace3 and if ‘urentes' is
neuter, it is not less idle than ‘arentes,'
which Bentley, Lambinus, and Cruquius
prefer. Authority is in favour of ‘ uren-
tes‚’ but on their own merits it would be
hard to decide between the two words,
‘Litoris Assyrii,’ Orelli says, may mean
either the deserta east of Syria, in which
Palmyra is situated, or the Syrian coast.
‘ Litoris ¹ can hardly mean any thing but
the latter. See note on C. ii. 11. 16.
[Ritter says that the ‘Assyrium litus’
means the shore of the Persian guis, to
which the ancient Assyrian empire ex-
tendedff' a most forced and absurd expla-
nation.

33. Visam Britannos] Our ancestors
had a bad name. St. J erome says he saw
a tribe in Gaul, the Atticoti, of British
asaza{aenszzffisfffla
too authentic to be doubted. See Tacitus
(Ann. xiv. 30), where he says of them,
“cruore captivo adolere aras et hominum
fibris consulere deos fas habebant? Virgil
(Georg. iii. 463) relates of the Geloni that
they ate chcese dipped in horses' blood.
Whether the Comani, who were a Canta-
brian tribe, did the same is doubtful.
Horace perhaps got his idea from virgil,
and Silius copied Horace (iii. 360) 2—-

“ Nec qui Massageten monstrans feritate
parentem
Cornipedis fusa satiaris, Concane, vena.”

[The ‘ Scythicus amnis' may be the Ta-

nais, Don.

38. addidit] The MSS. appear to be
almost equally divided between this read-
ing and two others, ‘abdidit’ and ‘reddi-
dit ;’ and Bentley, with Fea and Meineke,
prefers the last.
the conquest of the Salassi (Livy, Epit.
135 aud Dion Cassius liii. 25), Augus-
tus assigned their territory to some of the
praetorian troops, and there they built
Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), and about the
same time lands were assigned to others
in Lusitania, on which they built Augusta
Emerita (Merida). ‘ Reddidit’ may be
right, but ‘addidit' is a word used in a
like case by Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 31) z “ Co-
loniae Capua atque Nuceria additis vete-
ranis firmatae sunt.” It also comes nearer
to ‘ abdidit,’ which is the reading of all the
Scholiasta, who explain it of the soldiers
being sent to winter-quartem. 1 have no
faith in this reading, and believe it to be
a corruption of ‘ addidit: Dillenbr. thinks
‘abdidit' much the best: “mirifice con·

junctus cum finiendis veteranorum mili-

tum laboribus? The truth lies, in my
opinion, between ‘reddidit’ and ‘addiditl

40. Pierio recreatis antro] Suetonius,
in his life of Augustus (84, 85), relates that
he followed literary pur-suits with great
zeal, and dabbled in poetry. He could not
have had much time for such pursuits when
this ode was written, but he may have said
enough to let it be seen that he desired
leisure to follow them.

41. Vos lene consilium] The penulti-
mate vowel coalesces with the next, as in
‘ principium ’ (iii. 6. 6). ‘Alfenius ’ (S. i.
3. 130). ‘ Nasidieni ’ (S. ii. 8. 1). So Vir·
gil says (Aen. i. 73): “ Connfibio jungam
stabili? This appears to be no more than
a general commendation of the Muses.
‘Ye give peaceful counsel and rejoice in
giving it, because ye are gentle (almae)'
[or ‘ helping,' ‘ beneficent.’]

wars of the Titanes (with uranus), the
Gigantea the Aloidae, Typhon or Typhoeus
