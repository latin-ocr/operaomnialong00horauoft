HORATII FLACCI

Cur optas quod habes? Non nosti quid pater, inquit,
Chrysippus dicat: Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam

Nec soleas fecit, sutor tamen est sapiens.

Qui ?

Ut quamvis tacet Hermogenes, cantor tamen atque

Optimus est modulator ς ut Alfenius vafer, omni

means to affirm in reply to the taunt ‘ cur
optas quod habes ?’ is. that a man may be,
in the Stoic sense, a king, and yet not be
in a condition to exercise authority, as an
artisan or a singer may still be great in
his calling even when he has laid aside the
practice of it.

127. crepidas—soleas] ‘Crepida' (κρῆ-
ἶιζὶ) ἕέἑέιῗ. ¹3Xd⁸32ffi15¹2313ffi2ffiffl³
was a plain sandal fastened over the instep
by a strap, and worn by men as the ‘ san-
dalium ’ was worn by women. Gellius
(xiii. 21) makes the ‘ crepida ' and ‘ solea ’
identical, which they evidently were not in
Horace's day at least. “Omne ferme id
genus quibus plantarum calces tantum in-

, timae teguntur, caetera prope nuda et tere-

tibus habenis vincta sunt, ‘soleas ' dixerunt,
nonnunquam Graeca voce ‘crepidulas,'—-
ejusque calceamenti sutores ‘crepidarios'
dixerunt.'' The ‘soccus' was not mate—
rially different from the ‘ crepida,' and the
‘ Gallica,’ adopted from Gaul, was like the
⁴ solea! None of these were walking shoes

(⁴ calcei ') fit for wet or dirty roads, but'

were ordinarily worn only in the house.

129. Hermogenes] It has been stated
in the Introduction to the Second Satire
that this person has been confounded with
Tigellius whose death is mentioned in that
Satin-e, and whose character is described at
the beginning of this. Hermogenes is also
called Tigellius in S. 4. 73 3 10. 80, 90.
But as he is always spoken of as alive, he
cannot be Caesar's friend, Tigellius the
Sardinian, to whom, as observed before,
there are no grounds for giving the name
Hermogenes, though the Scholiasts give it
him. Hermogenes Tigellius was a teacher
of music (S. 10. 90), aud (whether ironi-
cally or not it is not easy to say) Horace
calls him a. first-rate singer herc, and im-
plies as much in S. 9. 25. But he had a
contempt for him in other respects, as
appears from S. 4. 723 10. 18 (where he
calls him a coxcomb)‚ and 10. 79 (where
he introduces him with a fool for his friend
or parasite).

130. Alfenius vafer] Ι have adopted
the orthography of this name which Orelli
says is found in an inscription respecting
P. Alsenius, who was consul Λα). 2. · He is

130

called Alphinius by Clinton (F. H. ΑΔ). 2).
Acron says on this passage, “ Urbane satis
Alfenum Vafrum (varum Ρ) Cremonen-
sem deridet, qui abjecta sutrina quam in
municipio suo exercuerat Romam venit;
magistroque usus Sulpicio jurisconsulto ad
tantam pervenit scientiam ut et consula-
tum gereret, et publico funere efferretur.'’
Porphyrion has nearly the same words,
and Comm. Cruq. has compounded the
two, only changing ‘Alfenum Vafrum ’ to
‘Alfinium Varum‚' and giving Sulpicius
the name of Marcus. Estre (p. 18¹7),
agreeing with Weichert (beet. Ven. pp.
45 sqq.), thinks there is nothing impro-
bable in the Scholiasts’ statements. They
appear to me to be compounded of different
elementa, one of which is the passage before
us. The Scholiasta, it is obvious, occa·
sionally give as information that which
they appear only to have gathered from
the text. That the disciple of Servius
Sulpicius, who died ΔΑΜ). 710, was not
the consul of A.U.c. ¹755, we may be pretty
sure. I have little doubt the jurist‚ the
consul, and Horace’s ex-sutor (most pro·
bably a different person froin either of
them), have all been dragged in to make
up the story of the Scholiasta. It should
be said however that a jurist Alfenus
Varus is reported by Pomponius (Dig. i. 2.
2. § 44) to have attained the consulship.
But no consul of that name appears till
the above Publius, who is with more pro-
bability supposed to have been the jurist’s
son than the jurist himself. In Cruquius'
oldest Blandinian MS. ‘sutor’ in v. 132
appeared as a corrected reading for ‘ton-
sor,’ the original word. Cruquius likes
‘tonsor’ better than ‘sutor,’ and quotes
Alexander ab Alexandro GeniaL Dier. lib.
vi., who says that Alfenius practised the
trade of a barber till he took up the study
of the law. Bentley prefers and edits
‘tonsore He relies partly on a. MS. of
Acron, in which ‘tonstrina’ appears in-
stead of the ‘sutrina’ of the above pas·
ffiggkeigggsffieffiffiassgg, 01ξὲἓίἰέΐὲ
rather for Horace's sake it should be taken
to have been a barber’s, lest he should be
convicted of repeating himself unneccssa-
rily. From ‘erat’ it has been infer-red
