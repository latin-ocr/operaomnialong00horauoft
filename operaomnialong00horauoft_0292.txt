HORATII FLACCI

Te copias, te consilium et tuos

Praebente divos.

Nam tibi, quo die
Portus Alexandrea supplex

35

Et vacuam patefecit aulam, .
Fortuna lustro prospera tertio
Belli secundos reddidit exitus,

Laudemque et optatum peractis

Imperiis decus arrogavit.

Te Cantaber non ante domabilis
Medusque et Indus, te profugus Scythes
, Miratur, o tutela praesens
Italiae dominaeque Romae.

Te fontium qui celat origines

Nilusque et Ister, te rapidus Tigris,
Te beluosus qui remotis
Obstrepit Oceanus Britannis,

gets his word from Homer (Il. xi. 67), οἱ δ’
ὥστ’ ἀμητῆρες ἐναντίοι ἀλλήλοισιν Ὄγμον
ἐλαύνωσιν.

32. εἰπε clade] See note on v. 13.

33. zie—praebente divos] See C. i. 7.
27 ιι. Augustus had the ‘ auspicia‚’ and
his stepsons were his ‘ legati.’

34. quo die] See C. i. 37, Introduction;
iv. 4, Introduction. There may have beeri
some representation of Alexandrea Sup-
plex in Horaee's day, such as the well-
known figures ofJudaea Capta and J udaea
Restituta on medals of Vespasian and
Hadrian. We do not hear of Augustus
having caused such a meda-1 to be struck,
but, as he had a triumph for the capture
of Alexandrea, such a commemoration of
the event may very well have taken place.
On the reverse of a medal of Hadrian
Alexandrea is represented as a matron re-
clining with three ears of corn in her hand,
aud the same number springing out of her
foot ; while her left arm rests upon a cup
with a vine-branch springing out of it, and
a bunch of grapes hanging over its side.

40. Imperiis decus arrogavit] ¹ Claimed
for the wars carried on under thy impe-
rium the glory thou didst desire? At-
tempts have been made to fix other mean-

suits both passages. What follows is a
compendious review of the successes of
Augustus. Before the present ode was
written the Cantabri had been finally sub-
dued by Agrippa ς the Parthians had re-
stored the standards of Crassus and M.

Antonius; the Scythians had prayed for an
alliance3 the distant nations of Asia had
done the same (see C. S. 55 sq. ), the suc-
cess of Lentulus had ehecked the inroads
of the tribes of the Danube (O. ii. 9. 23);
Egypt had long been a tributary provinee;
Armenia (Tigris) had been ceded by the
Parthians, Britain, though only threat-
ened, had sent tokens of submission. Au-
gustus was just returned from Gaul and
Spain, where he had put down the last
efforts of rebellion, having also driven back
the German tribes, whose success against
Lollius had thrown a stain upon the arms
of Rome (C. 2 of this book, Introduction).

45. Tesontium qui celat origines] This
applies only toNilus. Ι am not aware that
it was ever said of the Ister. The ancient
representatione of the Nile exhibit him as
covering his head with his robe, or with the
waters flowing from under his robe3 while
the Ister is exhibited with his urn in a
medal of Trajan, on whose column heis
represented as rising out of his stream to
do homage to Rome.

47. beluosus] This word does not occur
elsewhere in any classical writer. It re-
duces to the form of an adjective‘ scaten-
tem beluis' (O. iii. 27. 26). It corresponds
to πολυθρέμμων of Aeschylus, πολυκήτης
of Theocritus, and Homer’s μεγακήτης.
[Here ‘remotis’ means ‘distant ’ as well
as‘ separa ted ’ from the rest of the world.
See C. ii. ρωᾮ2. 10.]

persuadere (Druidae) non interire animos
