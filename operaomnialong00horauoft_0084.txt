48 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XIX.

Glycera (Γλυκέῥα) is one of Horace’s favourite names. She is set down as the cinara
of C. iv. 13. 21 (see n.), but with what show of reason, beyond their having the same
number of syllables, it is not easy to see. We need not take Horace too much at his
word when he says that his days of love were over. Many a young sentimentalist has
imagined this and found himself mistaken as the poet appears to have done. Thone
who choose to insist that Horace is confessing on his own account that “the heyday of
his blood was tamed‚'’ put this ode rather late, A.U.c. 729 οι· 7 30. Others find in the
allusion to the Parthian (v. 12) occasion to fix the date a few years later (¹734 or 735),
when the standards of Crassus had been recovered from that troublesome enemy. This
important epoch is ever before the minds of one section of the chronologists: “dies
noctesque quidam veluti spectris territi cogitassent de signis et captivis a. '734 a Parthis
Augusto redditis,” says Franke‚ whose acumen, however, while it has led him on the
whole into a more consistent and probable chronological scheme than Kirchner and
others, is not above being misled by too much zeal for its own inventions. 1 should be
no more disposed with him to say Horace wrote this ode while the Arabian expedition
(i. 29) was pending, than with his adversaries that he wrote it five or six years later.
When or under what circumstances or to whom (if any body) he wrote, we must be
content to be ignorant. (See C. iv. 1, Introduction.)

ARGUMENT.

The mother of love, Semele’s son, and wantonnaes recall my heart telove 1 thought I
had put away for ever. 1 burn for Glycera purer than marble, and that mischievous ⁷
face so dangerous to look upon. With all her strength hath Venus come upon me,
and bids me sing no more of idle themes, the Scythian and the Parthian. Build me
an altar, slaves, bring boughs and incense and wine, for I would sosten the goddess
with a victim.

MATER saeva cupidinum
Thebanaeque jubet me Semeles puer
Et lasciva Licentia
Finitis animum reddere amoribus.
Urit me Glycerae nitor v 5
Splendentis Pario marmore purius 3
Urit grata protervitas
Et voltus nimium lubricus adspici.
In me tota ruens Venus
Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas ιο

cation of the forms of ἔρως was derived tive as well as the nominative and accusa-
from the Greeks by the Romans. ‘ Seme· tive ? Such assertions have no meaning.

now. The older editions and the great the verb ‘labor-,³ He quotes this passage,
majority of MSS. have ‘Semelae’ But, and 1 have followed his interpretation in
as before obser-ved, Horace seems to prefer the Argument. It is hard to get a word

whieh occurs in some MSS„ and in Ven. ter compares σφαλερός. The English word
