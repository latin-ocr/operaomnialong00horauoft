192 HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN XXI.

The history of M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, of his learning and eloquence‚ and the
origin of his double cognomen, under both of which he appears in Horace’s poems, are
fully given in Velleius, ii. 71. The date of this ode, which is addressed to the testa
containing the wine intended for Messalla at a supper to which he has invited himself at
Horace’s house, cannot by any sort of evidence be even conjectured. Dillenbr. says it
was a song composed extempore at a party at which Messalla was symposiarch. In such
extemporaneous effusions Dillenbr. puts more faith than 1 can ; but the ode may have

been recited at the supper-table, and composed for the occasion it professes to have been
composed for.

ARGUMEN T.

Thou amphora, who wast filled at my birth, whether thy mission be one of sorrow or
joy, of strife, or love or sleep, come down, for Corvinus would have my better wine.
Learned though he be, he will not despise thee, for neither did old Cato. Thou dost
soften the inflexible‚ aud open the heart, aud bring back hope, and give strength and
courage to the humble. Liber, Venus, and the Graces shall keep thee company till
the dawn of day.

O NATA mecum consule Manlio,
Seu tu querelas sive geris jocos
Seu rixam et insanos amores
Seu facilem, pia testa, somnum,
Quocunque lectum nomine Massicum ⁵
Servas, moveri digna bono die,
Descende, Corvino jubente
Promere languidiora vina.

1. Ο nata memcm] Horace was born
A.U.c. 689, or 13.c. 65, when L. Manlius
Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta were con-
suls, in which year the amphora addressed
is here said to have been filled (C. iii. 8.
12 n.). ‘ Testa‚’ which signifles properly

5. Quocunque—nomine] ‘ On whatever
account.' Orelli quotes Varro (de Re R. i.
1. 6) : ‘⁴ Item advenerer Minervam et Ve-
nerem quarum unius procuratio oliveti, al-
terius hortorum, quo nomine rusticaVinalia
instituta? On the technical meaning of
‘ nomen’ signifying an entry in an account,
see Mr. Long’s note on Cic. in Verrem, ii.

it obviously means the latter. In Epod.
xiii. 6, Horace had before referred to this
wine: “Vina Torquato ’ move consule
pressa meo.'' ‘ Pia testa' Dacier renders
‘ aimable houteille.’ The force of the epi-
thet is more easily felt than described.
‘ Gentle cask' is Francis's translation, and
1 know nc better, for the meaning is to be
derived from its connexion with ‘facilem
somnum? [‘ Kindly jar‚' Newman.] Jahn
(in whose judgment Orelli always places
great faith) says Horace calls the testa
‘ pia‚’ because it was contemporary with
himself. 'rhat does not bring us much
nearer to the meaning.

1. 38. The derived sense of the word as
used here is better illustrated by Cic. de
Am. c. 25 z “ Multis nominibus est hoc
vitium notandum‚” i. e. on many accounts
or in many particulam. [The reference is
to the preceding stanza‚‘ quocunque effectu
sive quacunque potentiax as Ritter rightly
says, to the effect of the wine, not to the
name, as some take it literally, for the
name, as he tells us, is ‘Massicum ³] Lec-

tum,’ which Forcellini interprets‘ selecta&

rather applies to the gathering of the grape
Massic
wine was from Mons Massicus in campa-
nia. The word ‘ descendc’ is used because

from which the wine was made.
