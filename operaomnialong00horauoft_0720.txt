684 HORATII FLACCI

Talibus officiis prope mancum, ne mea saevus

J urg-ares ad te quod epistola nulla rediret.

Quid tum profeci mecum facientia jura

Si tamen attentas? Quereris super hoc etiam, quod
Exspectata tibi non mittam carmina mendax. 25
Luculli miles collecta viatica multis

Aerumnis, lassus dum noctu stertit, ad assem

Perdiderat; post hoc vehemens lupus et sibi et hosti

Iratus pariter, jejunis dentibus acer,

Praesidium regale loco dejecit, ut aiunt, 3ο
Summe munito et multarum divite rerum.

Clarus ob id factum donis ornatur honestis,

Accipit et bis dena super sestertia nummum.

Forte sub hoc tempus castellum evertere praetor

21. ne mea saevus jurgans] ‘Mea’
belongs to ‘epistola‚' and is out of
place. ‘ J urgo,’ which Varro derives from

Foroell.) The reading of the best MSS.
' and the editions of the fifteenth century is
⁶ rediret.’ Later editions, including Bentley,
have ‘veniret,' which also has MS. 811-
thority. Orelli, Dillenburger, Pottier, and
some others of the latest editors, have gone
back to the old reading. It is not easy to
understand how ‘rediret’ should have got
into such MSS. as the four Blandinian, the
Berne, and Parisian, if‘ veniret' were the
true reading. Nearly all Torrentius' MSS.
had ‘rediret‚’ and he approveS, but does
not edit, that reading. His text and his
notes are constantly 81 variance‚ and on this
account 110 18 osten quoted as an authority
for reading s he does not approve. As his

udgmentg was g‚ood this is to be re gretted.
Florus had written probably more thau
once, expostulating with Horace ou his
silence, and had received no answer.

24. Sa· tamen attentas] This word

Forcellini explains “labefactare et con-
vellere conaris :'' and he quotes Dig. 12. 6.
23. l: “Quum de sententia indubitata,
quae nullo remedio attentari potest, trans-
i itur.’'
8- super hoc] It is doubtful whether
this means ‘ besides this,’ as in S. ii. 6. 3,
“ Ε1 paulum silvae super his,’' or ‘about
this‚' as “ Palloecet super his” (A. P. 429).
Orelli takes it the former way.

26. Luculli miles collecta viatica] As
to Lucullus, see Epp. i. 6. 40 n. The
soldier of whom this story is told Por-
phyrion calls Valcn‘anus Servilianoe, and

he makes him an officer of rank, ‘praefec-
tus,' perhaps one of those who had oom-
mand of the auxiliary troops, though the
title was not confined probably to these.
(Caesar, B. G. i. 39, Long>s note.) Τ110
office of ‘praefectus castrorum,' which Orelli
supposes Porphyrion to mean, is not men·
tioned so early as the time of Lucullus.
VVhatever groundwork of truth there may
be in it, Horace has evidently altered the
story to suit his purpose. ‘Viatica’ would
include money as well as e and ‘ kit’
as our soldiers call it. Cicero uses the word
metaphorically for money (de Senect. 0. 18):

“Avaritia vero senilis quid sibi velit non
intelligo. Potest enim quidquam 0880
absurdius quam quo minus viae restat eo
plus viatici quaerere ?'’

30. Praesidium regale] A fortress in
which Mithridates kept part of his trea-
sures.

33. bis dena super sestertia] The ‘ses-
tertium ' was a sum equal to about δί. 17⁸.
ofour money, twenty of which (1662. laam.)
would not be a large sum for an officer of
rank. But he must be supposed, from
his exploits, to have held some command.
[⁶ Super ’ is used as an adverb, ‘besides.’]

34. Forte sub hoe tempus] ‘Soon aster
this time ' (Epod. ii. 44 n.). Lucullus had
been ‘praetor urbanus,' but he went into
Asia at the expiration of his consulship,
and therefore with the title of ’111-0001181113
A ‘praetor’ taking a province generally
went with the title of ‘propraetor,’ as
Brutus did into Macedonia. (S. i. 7. 18.)

[36. addere mentem] ‘ Give spirit to.'
Comp. Epp. 1. 2. 60 n.; and C. iii. 21. 18,
‘ addis cornua.’]
