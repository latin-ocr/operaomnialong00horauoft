HORATII FLACCI

Scilicet uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos
Et genus et formam regina Pecunia donat,

Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.
Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum rex :

Ne fueris hic tu.

36. Scilicet uxorem cum dote] On the
¹ dos ' see the Dict. Ant. ‘ Fidem' here sig-
nifies ‘credit.' ⁸ Pecunia' is here personi-
fied and made a royal lady, and Juvenal
apostrophizes her thus :—

“ —— funesta Pecunia, templo
Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum erexi-
mus aras '' (i. 113).

Arnobius, writing with the zeal of a cate-
chumen, says: “Quis ad extremum deam
Pecuniam esse credat Ρ. quam velut maxi-
mum numen vestrae indicant literae donare
annulos aureos, loca in ludis atque in spec-
taculis prima, amplitudinem magistratus?
&c- (contra Gentes, lib. 4, p. 125.) Au-
gustin (de Civitate Dei, iv. 21, and else-
where) speaks of Pecunia as a goddess
worshipped by the Romans} but there is
’ no foundation for this as a literal fact.
Mammon was not more worshipped at
Rome than it is among ourselves. Horace
here repeats in effect what he said in S. ii.

, “ ---— omnis enim res,
Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque
pulchris

Divitiis pareut.''

⁸ Suadela' is another form of Suada, who
represented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Per-
suasion. The name, Cicero tells us, was
latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15). Πειθώ wns
usually associated with Ἀφροδίτη, and
their statues stood together at Athens,
where Horace may have seen them. Ι can-
not find that Suada had any temple or sepa-
rate worship at Rome. She was supposed
to assist Venus in presiding at mam-ingess,
and she, the Graces, and Mercury were the
acknowl companions of that goddess.
Therefore Horace associates them here.
Cicero tells us that Ennius called the elo-
quent M. Cethegus “Suadae medullam ”

(Cat. Maj. c. 14), the marrow of persua-v

sion.' (Epp. ii. 2. 117 n.)

- 39. Mancipiis locuples] See S. ii. 7.
3 n. Cappadocia was governed by king-s
from an early period. A list of them is
given by Clinton (F. H. vol. iii. p. 430,
Append.). The last was Archelaus, who
was appointed by M. Antonius, A.U.c. 718.
Ariarathes VII„ who represented the liueal

kings of Cappadocia, having been deposed
and put to death. Archelaus was king at
the time this epistle was written, and he
reigned fifty years. At his death (ΔΑΜ).
770) Cappadocia was reduced to the form
of a Roman province, in the third year of
Tiberius (Tacitus, Ann. ii. 42). The king
had lauds and slaves on them, but he
wanted the precious metal. Ariobarzanes,
who was king of Cappadocia when Cicero
was governor of Cilicia, is described by him
as “rex perpauper '' (ad Att. vi. 3, 5).
‘⁶ Nullum aerarium, nullum vectigal habet.
Nihil illo regno spoliatius, nihil rege egen-
tius ’' (vi. 1, 3). M. Brutus had advanced
him large sums of money at exorbitant
interest, which he was unable to pay, and
Cicero, though he got 100 talents from
him, was unable to extract all the debt.
Cn. Pompeius too was his creditor, and all
he could get was a promissory note for 200
talents payable in six months, (ad Att. vi.
3). Horace advises his man not to be like
this king. ‘Hic’ is an adverb, like ἐν·
ntea. [The nominative, perhaps.]

40. chlamydes Lucullus, ut aiunt] L.
Licinius Lucullus began his public life under
Sulla, and assisted in checking Mithridates
and bringing him to terms, and, when the
war with that king broke out again after
Sulla’s death, he was appointed to the com·
mand. His extraordinary success against
Mithridates and Tigranes, king of Armenia,
are related by Plutarch in his life of Lu-
nullus. He was prevented from complet-
ing his work by the intrigues of his ene·
mies and the mutiny of his army, and being
superseded in his command by Cn. Pom-
peius, he returned to Rome with great
wealth accumulated by himself in Asia (for
he inherited nothing from his father),
which he devoted to self-indulgence3 so
that Plutarch (c. 39) compares his life to
an ancient comedy, the first part of which
is taken up with politica! and military af-
fairs, and the latter part with all sorts of
revelling. His houses (especially at Naples
and Tusculum), his gardens and works of
art, and preserves of fish, and household
fumiture, and the extravagance of his
meals and way of living, surpassed any
thing that had ever been known before.
and even in the imperial times his gai-dens,
