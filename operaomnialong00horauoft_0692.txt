656 HORATII FLACCI

us new arts, and drove out that rough old Saturnian measure, though even now there
remain traces of the old rusticity. It was not till after the Punic wars that we began
to turn our minds to the writings of Greece, and tried if we could translate their
tragedies. We were successful, for we have a spirit lofty and bold and tragic enough,
but our style needed correction.

(v. 168.) Comedy is supposed to have less labour than tragedy, because the subjecta
are common 3 but the fact is it has more difficulty because it' has less indulgence·
Don't you see how elever Plautus is in rakish youths, stingy fathers, tricksy bawds Ρ
How great is Dossennus in parasites, and how slip-shod he walks over the stage? All
he cares for is to put money in his purse 3 while those who take to writing for fame
rise and fall with the mere caprice of the spectator. Farewell the stage for me, if
applause is to make me fat and the refusal of it lean. The boldest poet is sometimes
disconcerted when the mob in the middle of the play call for bears and boxers. And
even the educated have turned to shows3 for hours the curtain is down for the ex-
bibition of processions and beasts, such as would make Democritus laugh, not at the
scene but the spectators. As to the noise that goes on in the theatres, the foresta of
Garganum and the roaring of the sea are nothing to it. And what is it all about Ρ
Has the actor spoken Ρ Not a word. They are applauding his fine clothes!

(v. 208.) But lest you should think I bestow grudging praise on an art 1 cannot
practise, Ι declare there is nothing that man is not capable of, in my opinion, who
can move my soul with fiction and magician-like transport me from place to place.

(v. 214.) But Ι pra)r you bestow some pati-onage on those who write, not for spectators
but for readers3 so shall you worthily fill Apollo’s library, and give us poets a spur of
encouragement‚ though we do a great many wrong things 1 must admit5 for in-
stance, when we intrude upon you out of season 3 are offended at being told of a.
blemish3 repeat our verses again and again without being asked 3 mourn that our
difficulties are not appreciated; expect you to send for us instantly, and bid us write,
and make our fortunes. But we ought to consider who is worthy to be entrusted
with the recording of 'such virtues. Choerilus got gold from Alexander for his
wretched verses ; but such, like ink, only stain the deeds they profess to praise.
Alexander judged better when he ordered that none should paint him but Apelles, or =
make his statue but Lysippus. But in the matter of poetry his tante was Boeotian.
Virgil and Varius do no disgrace to your generosity ς and no statue ever expressed
the face of heroes more vividly than the poet's craft their souls. Much rather would
Ι sing of your noble decds, of conquered lands, and rivers, and lofty heights, and bar-
barian realms 3 of peace restored and Parthians terrificd, if what I would Ι could.
But I may not venture beyond my strength. Officiousness often stupidly tormenta
the object of its love, especially when it is allied with verse. Men easily remember
what gives them mirth‚ and for my part I have no mind for such oppressiva atten-
tions. I don’t wish to have my features murdered in a bust of wax, or to be cele-
brated in clumsy verse, lest 1 be carried out along with my poet like a corpse on the
poor man’s bier, and consigned with him to his tomb in the grocer's shop.
