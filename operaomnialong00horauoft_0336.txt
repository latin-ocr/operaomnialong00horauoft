300 HORATII FLACCI

GARMEN XI.

Supposing that Inachia (v. 6) were admitted to be the same as the Inachia of the
next ode (which is very doubtful, for the name is fictitious, and the person is most
probably fictitious too), we should be at liberty to say that at least two years elapsed
between the composition of that ode and this ς but as neither contains any certain evi-
dence of its date, this compat-ison even then would be of no value for determining when
they were written. Franke compares Sat. ii. 3. 325, where Damasippus charges Horace
with “Mille puellarum, puerorum mille furores,” with his own excuse for writing so
little in this ode, “Amore‚ qui me praeter omnes expetit Mollibus in pueris autin puellis
urere ” (vv. 3, 4) 3 and from this infers they were written about the same time. But
the Satire appears to have been written at the end of A.U.o. 721; wherefore he infers
the Epode was written in that year; which however is not very convincing. Ι can see
nothing in the ode but a specimen of that species of composition to which Horace first
betook himself in imitation of the Greek amatory writers. The metre is artificia] and
difficult of adaptation to the Latin language, and the last that any writer in that lan-
guage would resort to for the expression of passion, though in the Greek it is very
expressive and tender. Ι do not believe therefore that this ode can be identified with
any precise period of Horace’s lise ; and to imagine him deeply in love with some young
Lyciscus is quite foreign to the view I take of Horace’s love poems. The name Lyciscus
is probably formed from Lycus, Alcaeus’ favourite boy (C. i. 32, 11).

ARGUMENT.

Pettius, Ι am so smitten with the heavy hand of Love, who makes me above others his
victim,'that Ι cannot write as 1 used. ’Tis two years since I gave up Inachia. Ah!
what a byword was I then ! How I sighed in company and poured out my complaints
to thee when wine had opened my heart! “Has the poor man’s wit no chance
against the rich man’s purse? My wrath is kindled: I cast my modesty and my
sighs to the winds· I will contend with such rivals no more.’' Thus did Ι boast-
but my feet carried me still to her cruel door. Now Lyciscus has caught my beart,
who boasts that he surpasses every woman in delicacy, nor can counsel or raillery
deliver me, nor aught but some new flame.

PET'H, nihil me sicut antea juvat
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
