PREFACE. ix

Profaoe has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the several
books, without stating the grounds on which he founds it. It
will be seen that I prefer Franke’s opim'on on this subject to
Kirehner's‚ but that there are many instances in which his zeal
appears to outstrip his judgment in determining the date of

particular poems.

¹ Of the other books that Ι have used I have been most indebted
to Estre’s Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most
favourable specimen of industry and judgment. ·

I have studied with much pleasure the fragments of the Greek
Lyric poets, with whose entire works Horace must have been
familiar. The little that is lest may make us mourn for what is

lost. So much beauty has perished as the world will never see
again. There is more power of tendeiness and passionate feeling

in some of Sappho's small fragments than in all that Horace ever ”

wrote. Such passages of these poets as he appears to have imitated,
intentionally or otherwise, I have given, so far as they can be
gathered from the fragments now remaining, the edition of which
by Bergk (Leipzig, 1843) is that which I have used. Most of
them had been quoted before.

This leads me to say that I have not loaded the notes with nearly
so many quotations as most who have gone before me. I have
tried to confine myself to such passages as throw light upon the
text, or appear to have been imitated by or copied from Horace.
When I have met with a quotation in any of the late commentators
that appeared to have originated from himself, Ι have given his
name. Where, on the other hand, as is the case very often, the
quotation is only one of the common stock that has accumulated
from the Scholiasts downwards, I have given credit for it to no one,
but do not on that account wish to have the credit of it myself.
If any have been suggested by my own memory or reading, I have

, not inquired whether others had thought of them before, and shall

hope that I may not appear to have defrauded any one. I have
