70. plagosum mibi parvo Orbilium die·
tm] Orbilius Pupillus was a native of
Beneventum. He early lost his parents,
who had given him a good education, and
beiuglest destitute, became an apparitor
to the magistrates in his native town. He
aster-words served iu the army, and then
returned home and taught. In his fistieth
year (A.u.c. 691) iu the consulship of
Cicero, he came to Rome and set up a
school, which brought him more fame than
profit. He wrote a book on the ill-treat-
ment that teachers experienced from the
parents of their pupils. Perhaps they had
reason to find fault with him if Horace’s
epithet gives a right notion of his charac-
ter. He seems to have held the rod as the

ing long lost his memory. His towns-
people were prond of him and erected a
marble statue to his memory. These parti-
culm are from Suetonius’ treatise De
Illustr. Grammaticis, c. 9. Orbilius was
in his forty-eighth year when Horace was
born. He was therefore not young when
the poet went to his school. Perhaps
Horace’s judgment of Livius may have
been influenced by his early recollections‚
and “what it then detested still abhorred‚”
as a modern poet has said of Horace him-
self, “the drill'd dull laeson forced down
word by word.” The author of the Dia-
logus de Oratoribus complains (c. 23) that

thinks the boys learnt the Latin Odyssey
to enable them to understand the Greek.
If so Orbilius deserved an application of
his own cane. He ap to have been
one of the old school, and perhaps he
thought that pleasant learning was not
good sor young minda 3 but Bentley,
thinking it improbable a schoolmaster of
repnte would teach boys of noble birth such
language as that of Livius, has changed Livi
into Laevi, with the support of one MS.
Laevius (if he ever existed) was a writer
of small love verses and a contemporary of
Cicero. He bas therefore no place here.

75. ducit venditque pok’ma] The mean-
ing of ‘vendit ’ is the same as in Juvenal
(vii. 135), ‘⁸ purpura vendit Causidicum,
vendunt amethystina.'' It commends the
whole poem. [Kriiger quotes Cicero (ad
Att. xiii. 22) where ‘vendidisti' means
‘ commendasti.’ Compare ad Att. xiii. 19,
‘ commendavit.’] ‘ Ducit ’ seems to mean,
‘brings it fon-ward: or ‘carries the poem
with it.' A great many interpretations
have been given, and Bentley can find no
sense. in this word. He therefore, on the
authority of one MS„ which he calls “egre-
gius eodexss’ changes ‘vendit’ to ‘venit‚’
and makes ‘poema ' the nominative to the
verbs, and ‘ ducit ' he interprets “ decipit,
fuco fallit, palpo percutit,” ‘takes in pur-
pgasersss as “emptorem ducat hiantem ''
