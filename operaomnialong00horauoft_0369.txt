Denique sit finis quaerendi, quumque habeas plus
Pauper-iem metuas minus et finire laborem

Incipias, parto quod avebas, ne facias quod

Ummidius quidam, non longa est fabula, dives 95
Ut metiretur nummos; ita sordidus ut se

Non unquam servo melius vestiret ς adusque

Supremum tempus, ne se penuria victus

Opprimeret metuebat.

At hunc liberta securi

Divisit medium, fortissima Tyndaridarum. 100

to the obvious meaning of this passage,
which the Scholiasta mistaking make
Maenius 8 sordid fellow and Nomentanus

arodigal. They 810 united again in S. i.
8. 11; ii. 1. 22, where the former appears
under the name Pantolabus, one who lays
his hands on any thing he 088 get. He
spent his money and turned parasite.
This is in accordance with what the Scho-
118818 Acron and Comm. Cruq. affirm on
Epp. i. 15. 26 :—

“qunius ut rebus maternis atque pa-
rms

Fortiter absumptis?

Buton S. i.8.11theytclladifferent
story ry, and say that the real 118810 of Pan·
tolabus was Mallius, to which Acron 8811
Porphyrion add Verus, whether as 8 110-

(Heusdius, Studia erit. in C. Lucilium,
p. 230.) But we had better admit some
confusion to exist in the Scholiasts' state·
ments or text. Both Maenius and No-
mentanus are names used by Lucilius sor
characters of the same kind,y aud Horace
may have only borrowed the names to re·
praeent some living characters whom he
dom not choose to mention. Nomentanus
(whom the Scholiasts on this passage ml]
L. Cassius) was the name of one of the
guaets at Nasidienus’ dinner (S. ii. 8. 25),
and the Scholiasts tell us a story of the
historian Sallust hiring his cook for an
enormous sum of money. Cruq uius’ Com·
