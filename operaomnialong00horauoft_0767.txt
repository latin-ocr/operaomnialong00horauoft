 

NOTE on anmzz ΙΙ. 3. 69,

‘ Scribe decem a Nerio!

'nze reading in the text is ‘ Scribe decem Nerio? and if that is the true reading, the
explanation in the notes may be as good as any other. But as the reading ‘scribe
decem a Nerio ' has the better authority, we must attempt to explain it. There is no
occasion to show here that ⁸ decem ' means a sum of money. That is proved clearly in
the note on S. ii. 3. 69, and by Krfiger in a usefnl excursus on this passage. The expla-
nation of Orelli and Ritter that ‘decem ’ means ‘ decem tabulas ’ is a mistake which
we could hardly expect such excellent commentatore to make.

We must next consider what ‘ scribe a Nerio' means. The preposition ‘ab ' is thus
used in a passage of Cicero (pro Flacco, c. 19, quoted by Krfiger), ‘Si praetor dedit, ut
est scriptum, a quaestore numeravit ; quaestor a mensa publica ; mensa aut ex vectigali
aut ex tributo :' which means, the praetor paid by an order on the quaestor ; the quae·
ator gave an order on the public bank, and finally the bank paid the money out of
the fnnds which it had in possession. The passage in Livy (24. c. 18, ‘a quaestore
perscribebatur ') may also be compared with this in Horace.

The conclusion is that ⁶ scribe decem a Nerio ’ expresses a payment of money made by
the banker Nerius to some borrower, and made pursuant to the order of some lender,
who may be Perillius (v. 74, ‘ Perilli dictantis quod tu numquam rescribere possis ’).
'l'he entry in the books of Nerius of the loan made on the order of Perillius would be
evidence against the borrower, for the entry would be made with his knowledge and
consent. As ‘ scribere ’ here expressesthe lending of the money, so ‘rescribere ' expresses

- the rep-yment3 for the evidence of the repayment would be an entry in the books

which would have the effect of annulling the entry of the debt.

Ifit should be asked to whom is the word ‘ scribe ’ adds-essed, to the lender or the
borrower, the answer is that it is not necessary to suppose the word to be addressed to
either. It means no more than ‘ suppose Nerius to advance a sum of money to a bor-
rower upon the order of a lender.’ Further, ⁸ suppose a hundred written securities
besides, such securities as wily Cicuta employs! All these words in the second person,
‘ scribe? ‘adde‚’ ‘ rapies) ‘ tu rescribere possis ' must beinterpreted generally ι ‘ suppose
the money lent ς’ ‘ suppose the additional written securities ;’ ‘ suppose the debtor brought
into court ;' and lastly, in ‘ tu nunquam rescribere possis? ‘ tu’ is Damasippus or any
man who borrows and does not repay.

A like use of ‘ adde ’ occurs in S. ii. 3. 321, ‘ adde poemata ,nuncl

The passage, though it is difficult and has given the commentators much trouble, is
perfectly plain, if we look at it in the right way. Krfiger’s is the only true explanation
that 1 have seen. G. 1..
