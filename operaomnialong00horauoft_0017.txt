PREFACE. ⁷ xiii

Ritter’s Commentary, and I have got good matter stom it. Ritter
is a sharp critic and a learned man, who has done something for
the explanation of Horace, and I acknowledge my obligations to
him. It is his business to excuse himself, if 113 can, for writing
some absurd notes and proposing some interpretatione which no
sensible man will accept.

I have also used for the Satires and Epistles Kriiger's school
edition, with German notes. It is 3 very useful book. The notes
prove that the editor has good judgment‚ 311(1 what we in this
country call sound common sense, in which many learned editors
arc very deficient.

1 have not touched Mr. Macleane’s arguments and introdwtions,
except in very few cases; nor have I added any thing on the chro-
nology of the poems, except 3 little 11313 311(1 there. Mr. Macleane
has done this very well. He judiciously abstained from fixing
dates where there is no evidence, unlike many critics who have
sometimes fixed them without evidence and sometimes contrary to
evidence. Indeed‚ most commentators have very imperfect concep-
tions of the nature of proof; and it would be a great improvement
if they could be taught in some way not to confound hypotheses
311(1 guesses with probable conclusions 311(1 (13111011311311011.
⁸ 1 shall here put a question which some people may think unne-
cessary; but I do not think so. When a manhasbeen used‘w
read 3 book 31 intervals for half 3 century, he may reasonably ask
himself whether 113 1133 113311 wasting his time, and whether other
persons may not do the same. There 313 only few books worth
reading of’oen or much ς but Horace is one of them. He lived with
some of the chief men of 311 age when the Roman polity was chang-
ing into a form which has had a lasting influence on Europe, and
through Europe on the rest of the world ; and his writings have
made us familiar with the man himself, with the times in which he
lived, the character of his contemporaries, 311(1 the manners of the
day. Horace’s good sense makes his Satires and Epistlae almost as
intelligible and 33 instructive as if they were written now3 for the
boet partos them is independent of the 'allusions to things and per-
sons, and many of the allusions are not more obscure than similar
