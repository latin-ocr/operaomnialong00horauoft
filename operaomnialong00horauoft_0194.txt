HORATII FLACCI

ARGUM EN'r.

On you will be visited your fathers' guilt, Ο Romans, unless ye shall restore the worship
and acknowledge the sovereign power of the gods. Already have they afflicted our

land ; twice the Parthian bath checked our arms, the barbarian hath well nigh
destroyed us in the midst of our strife, the age is so fun of shameless adultery and
lasciviousness. Not from such parents were born the conquerors of Pyrrhus, Antiochus,
and Hannibal, the manly offspring of soldiers who had handled the plough and
carried the faggot. So doth time spoil all things. Our fathers were not as their
fathers, nor we as they; and our children shall be worse than oui-selves-

Dnmcm majorum immeritus lues,
Romane, donec templa refeceris
Aedesque labentes deorum et
Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.
Dis te minorem quod geris imperas : 5
Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum.
Di multa neglecti dederunt
Hesperiae mala luctuosae.
J am bis Monaeses et Pacori manus

Non auspicatos contudit impetus

Nostros et adjecisse praedam
Torquibus exiguis renidet.

1. immeritus] 1 do not see the difficulty
said to exist in this word. Tbe' ode is ad-
dressed, like the others, ‘ virginibus pueris-
qne‚’ and they could not be said to be re·
sponsible for the guilt of the civil wars
(delicta) just brought to a close 3 but if they

failed to do their duty in restoring the “Tu

temples, and so repairing the consequences
of the wars, they must be prepared to reap
the fruits of them in the displeasure of the
gods. Suetonius (C. ii. 15, Introduction)
relates how Augustus applied himself to
the restoration of the sacred buildings,
which Ovid also records (Fast. ii. 59 sqq.)‚
and Virgil thus amplifies his piety :—

“At Caesar triplici invectus Romana tri-
Mgemniliihdis Italis votum immortale sacra·
Mgiliiiia ter centum totam delubra per

urbem.'’ (Aen. viii. '714 sqq.)

‘Delubra' mere way· -side shrines, each con-
taining an image or an altar οι· both,
must not be confounded with ‘ltempla
'liberius followed up the work that Angus-
tus began (Tac. Ann. ii. 49). “Iisdem
tem poribus deum aedes vetustate aut' igni
abolitas, coeptasque ab Augusto dedicavit?
The temples he built or completed were

three in number, dedicated to Liber, Libera,
and Ceres, to Flora, and to Juno. See C.
ii. 15. 20. S. ii. 2. 104.

2. Romane] Horace uses the same form
again, “Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane,
caveto ’⁹ (S. i. 4. 85) ς and Vin-gil likcwise,
regere imperio populos, Romane, me-
mento'’ (Aen. vi. 852). Livy often ex-
presses himself so, as Quintilian observes
(Inst. viii. 6), “Maxime in orando valebit
numerorum illa libertas: nam et Livius
saepe sic dicit ‘Romanus proelio victor‚’
cum Romanos vicisse significat?

6 principium] See C. 4.41n. Orelli
quotes Livy (xlv. 39):

9. Monaeses et Pacori manue] Pacorus
was son of the Parthian king, Arsaces
XIV, or Orodes, as he is named, and ap
pointed by his father to command the army
against the Romans in the place of Surenas,
who defeated Crassus mmo. ¹701, and was
afterwards put to death by Orodes (Plu—
tarch, Crassus, c. 33). Pacorus was asso-
ciated with the renegade Labienus, and
overran Syria and a great part of Asis
Minor, while Μ. Antonius was' amusmg
himself with Cleopatra. Who Monaeses

was is not so certain. The principal person
