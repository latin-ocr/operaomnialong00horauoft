Stultitia caruisse.

HORATII FLAeffl

Vides quae maxima credis “ “”

Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam,
Quanto devites animi capitisque labore.

Impiger extremos curris mercator ad Indos,

45

Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes:
Ne cures ea quae stulte miraris et optas

Discere et audire et meliori credere non vis?
Quis circum pagos et circum compita pugnax

Magna coronari contemnat Olympia, cui spes,

50

Cui sit conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?

Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.

“ O cives, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est 3
Virtus post nummos.'' Haec J anus summus ab imo

may at least begin to learn, aud the first
step towards virtue is to put, away vice.
What follows is an illustration of this.
As to ‘ repulsa? see C. iii. 2. 17. He who
would secure au election must have a com-
mand of money.

44. capitisque labore] ‘ Caput' is here
put for the whole body. We do not use it
so, but for the seat of intefligence, which
the Romans placed in the heart, not in
the brain. On ‘per saxa, per ignes: see
C. iv. 14. 243 S. ii. 3. 56.

47. Ne cures ea] ‘ In order that you
may cesse to care for those things which
{51³5 ‘¹521 ῗοῖοῗὲῗέὶῖΥ ..3¹⁰3ssss (18ῗὲ ἧιῗζέ
the eicperience of a better man than your-
self ?'

49. Quis circum pagos] Suetonius says
of Augustus (c. 45) that he was very fond
of observing boxers, “ et maxime Latinos ε
nou legitimos atque ordinarios modo sed
et catervarios oppidanos inter angustias
vicorum pugnantes temere ac sine arte.”
These latter are what Horace alludes to:
boxers who went about the streets and the
country villages and fought for the amuse-
ment of the inhabitants and for what they
could pick up. Horace does not merely
mean what took place at the Paganalia
and· Compitalia, but frequently. ‘ Coronari
Olympia' is a Greek way of speaking.
Horace says, what boxer who goes about
the country towns exhibiting would de-
spise the Olympio pri ees if he had a hope,
still more a promise, that he should be
crowned without a struggle Ρ By this he
means, men strive after happiness iu the
shape of richeri, ἃς. 3 but if they will learn
wisdom, that shall give them all they can
desire without trouble 01· pain. The world

may judge otherwise, and make wealth
the standard of worth 3 but the world is
not to be listened to, it is foolish and in-
consistent. ‘ Sine pulvere’ is like the
Greek ἀκονιτί.

54. Janus summus ab imo] See S. ii.
3. 18. Most modern editions have ‘ pro-
docet‚’ which appears in good MSS„ but
was first edited by Lambinus. The word
does not occur elsewhere. The Greeks
used προδιδάσκειν, as Demos. p. 1231. 26 ς
Soph. Aj. 163; Trach. 681, and elsewhere.
It signifies ‘to warn‚’ ‘to teach before-
hand? Lambinus, Doering, Fen, and
others, explain ‘ prodocet' by ἐκδιδάσκει,
i. e. ‘ publice, palam docet? [meten who
has ‘prodocet‚' explains it thus: ‘palam
docet, sine rubore tamquam rem bonam
docet.'] Ven. 1483 has ‘praedocet' and
many old editions and some MSS. have
the same. The editio princeps has ‘ per-
docet,' and so had some of Cruquius' MSS„
and all the editions of the sixteenth cen-
tury. It is defended by Torrentius and
H. Stephens (Diat. pp. 45, 127), in whose
time it was the vulgar reading. 1 think
it is the true one. ‘Perdocet' means it
persists in teaching, it enforces. Horace
says that as gold is more precious than
silver, virtue is more precious than gold3
whereas from one end of the Forum to
the other (not only by the money-leaders,
as Orelli says) the opposite doctrine is iu·
sisted upon, and old and young go there
to learn it, as boys going to school. and
repeat it as school-boys repeat their tasks
dictated to them by the master. Vei-se 56 .
is repeated from S. i. 6. ¹74. Ounningham‚
Smadon, and others omit this verse, but
no MSS. omit it, and this is not tho only
instance in which Horace repeats himself.
