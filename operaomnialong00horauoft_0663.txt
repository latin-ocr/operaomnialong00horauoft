where Suetonius says it was of no great
extent: ‘¹ Forum angustius fecit, non ausus
extorquere possessoribus proximas domos ''
(c. 56). The allusions to the Forum Au-
gusti are common. Servius on Aen. i.
298, “Furor impius intus Saeva sedens

tially destroyed by fire, and roetorcd by
Hadrian. Other ‘sora’ were asterwards
elected by different emperors (Nerva,
'lh-ajan, Vespasian). But in Martial's time
there were only three in which judicinl

businaes was transacted (iii. 38):
“Causas inquis, agam Cicerone disertius

In every ‘forum ’ there was a ‘ basilica '
(or more than one), a building devoted to
the joint purposes of judicial and com-
mercial business. At the end of the build-
ing was a part mlled‘ tribunal‚' devoted
to law (for which the early ones were ex-
clusively intended); and in a later‘ basi—
lica’ (that of Trajan) there was a ‘tribunal'
at each end. Tbere was in the Forum
Romanum the Basilica Porcia, erected by
M. Porcius Cato when he was Censor,
Anu c. 570. Plutarch mentions its erec·
tion' ιιι his life of Cato the Censor (c. 19),
and in that of Cato of Utica (c. 5) he says
that here the tribunes did their business,
and herc Cato first distinguished himself
as aspeaker. There were also two Basi-
licae Aemiliae eret-ted or restored b)
