HORATII FLACCI

Cum recte tractent alii laudare maligne,

Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur

210

Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,

Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,

Ut magus, et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis,
Verum age et his qui se lectori credere malunt

Quam spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi

215

Curam redde brevem, si munus Apolline dignum
Vis complere libris et vatibus addere calcar,

Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem.
Multa quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae,

(Ut vineta egomet caedam mea,) cum tibi librum

220

Sollicito damus aut fesso3 cum laedimur unum
Si quis amicorum est ausus reprehendere versum ς
Cum loca jam recitata revolvimus irrevocati ;
Cum lamentamur non apparere labores

Nostros et tenui deducta poemata filo3

'225

Cum speramus eo rem venturam ut simul atque
Carmina rescieris nos fingere commodus ultro
Arcessas, et egere vetes, et scribere cogas.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales

Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique

Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae.
Gratus Alexandro regi Magno fuit ille

trary, he considers that he who could suc-
ceed in exciting his feelings with fictitious
(inaniter) griefs and fears, and transport
himin imagination to distant places, could
do any thing he chose to try, dance on a
tight rope if he pleased‚ m which there' is
a little jocular irony perhaps. The Greek
name for a rope-dancer was σχοινοβάτης,
and those who exhibited at Rome were
usually Greeks. [‘ Laudare maligne,' ‘to
give scant praise? Comp. ‘malignus‚' C.
i. 28. 23.

216. gua-am redde brevem] From one
MS. (Trinity College) Bentley substitutes

‘impende ’ for ‘ redde, ' the reading of all

other MSS. and all but a few editions
which have followed his own. [¹ Curam.
brevemz' ‘to these also (et his) pay some
little attention which is their due. '] ‘Mu-
nus Apolline dignum' is the library men-
tioned C. i. 31, Int. Epp. i. 3. 17.

220. Ut vineta egomet caedam mea]
Τ110 man who damages his own vines hui-ts
himself more than any one else, and this is

the meaning of the proverb.

223. revolvimus ist-revocati] The com-
pounds of ‘ volvere ' are used for reading,
from the shape of the books rolled up.

‘Revolvere ’ is to read again. One of the
ways therefore that he says authors get
themselves into trouble is by reading over
again and again passages they think very
fine, but which their patron h'as not taken
the trouble to ask forp again.

44225. deducta poemata filo] S. i. 10.

11.

[227. rescieris] ‘ Found out,’ ⁸ heard!
Caesar, Β. G. i. 28, ‘Quod ubi Caesar re-
sciit.'

230]. Aedituos] As to the orthography
of this word see the authorities quoted by
Mr. Long on Cic. in Verrem, ii. 4. 44. It
means the keeper of a temple. Horace says
it is worth while to see what kind of
persons should be entrusted with the keep-
ing of Augustus’ fame, what poets should
be allowed to tell of it.
