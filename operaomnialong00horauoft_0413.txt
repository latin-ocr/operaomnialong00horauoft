ronst. cos. 111. oonsumvrrss' Horace
speaks elsewhere of the traveller “qui
Capua Romam petit imbre lutoque Ad-
spersus” (Epp. i. 11. 11). 1 think with
Orelli that Horace means the rond was
bad, and that they who took the Journey
leisurely eaenped 1ιοΙιιιις md mconvenience.

In one of the verses of Luciliua’ Satire
mentioned in the Introdudcion he sn ys,

Foro Appii viatores propter aquam quae
ibi deterrima est manere vitant. Dicit
ergo Horatius se ibi coenare noluisse ne
necesse haberet bibere'' (Porphyrion). At
Appii Forum they embarked at night‘ ιιι ιι

Yon-acina. A party were waiting at the
same inn ιο go with them, and Horace
waited with impatieuce till they had done
supper. ‘These he means ‘comitem’
This canal, which was constructed by Au-
gustus ιιι his attempt (A. P. 65) ιο drain
the Pomptine marshes, ιιι referred ιο by
Strabo (ιαμ .233·) Πλησίοντῆς Ταρῥακίιης

There are still traces of this canal, which
was nineteen miles long, and was called
in consequence Decennovium. It is also
mentioned by Lucan (iii. 85): “Et qua
Pomptinas via. dividit uda paludes? The
road may have been defective herenbouts,
as it was the general practice of travellers
to exchange it for the canal, and to make
the journey by night, as Strabo informs ns
in the above passage.
