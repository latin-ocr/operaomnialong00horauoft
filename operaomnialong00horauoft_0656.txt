620 , HORATII FLACCI

Me facit invisum, gelida cum perluor unda

Per medium frigus.

Sane murteta relinqui 5

Dictaque cessantem nervis elidere morbum

Sulphura contemni vicus gemit, invidus aegris,

Qui caput et stomachum supponere font-ibus audent

Clusinis Gabiosque petunt et frigida rura.

Mutandus locus est et deversoria nota ιο

Praeteragendus equus.

Quo tendis? Non mihi Cumas

Ἴ Est iter aut Baias, laeva stomachosus habena

order of the names is inverted, as in C. ii.
2. 33 11. 2.

3. et tamen illis me facit invisum]
‘Though it is all Musa’s fault, he makes
Baiae hate me as if it was my own fault :
that instead of enjoying her pleasant cli-
mate and warm baths, 1 am being drenched
. with cold water in the middle of winter?
This seems to be Horace’s meaning, and he
remarks that the town is angry with all
the patients for deserting it. ‘ Murteta’ are
groves in which houses were erected for
vapour baths. [‘ Quarundam naturalium
sudationum, ubi e terra profusus calidus
vapor aedificio includitur, sicut super Baias
in murtetis habemus? Celsus ii. 17. These
were natural sweating-baths. Celsus says,
iii. 21, ‘maxime utiles naturales et siccae
sudationes sunt ' like those at Baiae. They
were supposed to be good for chronic com-

laints.
p 8. (2Ξὶ eaput et stomachum] A douche
bath ou the head or stomach would now be
thought a strong remedy even by hydro-
pathists 3 but it is one of those which Musa
recommended and Celsus likewise (i. 4 3
iv. 5 . ⁷

9. ) Clusinis Gabiosque] Clusium (Chiusi)
was one of the chief towns of Etruria, the
capital of Porsenna, and the place where
the Gauls received that insult which ledto
their siege of Rome (Liv. v. 33). ⁵It was
situated on the Via Cassia, about 100 miles
north of Rome. The river Clanis (la
Chiana) flows hy it. As to Gabii, see Ep.
11. 7 n. Fea says there are sulphur baths
there still. But it was not for sulphur
baths that the Romans went there. Strabo
(p. 238) mentions several cold streams here
called τὰ Ἀλβυυλα, which were useful in
many complaints both for bathing and

drinking. The baths of Clusium may be

those that Tibullus refers to (iii. 5. 1) :— ·

“ Vos tenet Etruscis manat quae fontibus

unda,
Unda ub aestivum non adeunda
Can m.
Nunc autem sacris Baiarum maxima
lymphis,

Cum se purpureo vere remittit humus.”

10. deversoria] See S. i. 5. 2 n. [The
traveller would go along the Via Appia till
he came to Sinuessa or somewhere there-
abouts, and then he would turn to the right
to reach Cumae. If he were not going to
Cumae, he would keep his horse on the
main road to the lefl: and go to Capua and
so ou to Salernum, if that was the place
that he was travelling to.] This explains
‘laeva habena? The horse would attempt
to turn to the right as usual to go to
Cumae, from whence the rond was con-
tinued to the Luci-*ine Lake and to Bauli
and Baiae.

13. sed equi frenato est auris in ore]
Bentley, on very slender authority, changed
‘equi‚’ the common reading, to ‘equis’
It gives a little more meaning to the
words to apply the-m to the horse to
which the words of the rider are ad·
dressed.

[15. Collectos imbres] Rain-water eol-
leeted in cisterns or tanks. ‘Jugis aquae‚’
S. ii. 6. 2.
