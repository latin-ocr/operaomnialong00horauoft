reading I have followed is that of all the
old editions, and of every other that Ι have
seen till the present century. Bentley
adopts it without remark. But Lambinus
mentions that six of his MSS„ and Cru-
quius that some of his, had “ si quis sanus
facit et sanus facies tu 3’' and Torrentius
in two of his found the same reading, ex-
cept ‘facias' for ‘facies' Fea quotes
many authorities for ‘ facit et sanus facies
tu,' which he adopts. Orelli quotes one
or two MSS. that support that reading,
which he also follows. Dillenbr. does the
same without remark. There is so much
good authority for the common reading
that 1 see no reason for deserting it.
Either way there is not much consistency
in Damasippus urging Horace to write at
the beginning of the Satire, and calling
him mad for doing so at the end of it.
323. horrendam rabiem] Doering and
’ others apply this to the spirit which

breathed in his “criminosi iambi” (C. i.·
16). It more probably refers to his tem-

per generally, but the charge against him-

self need not be taken seriously. We have

no reason to believe Horace was an ill-

tempered man. He lamenta the facility

of his temper on one occasion (S. i. 9. 11).

[‘ Cultum ε’ ‘way of living? Compare

S. ii. 2. 66. Caesar, B. G. i. 13 vi. 19.]

324. Tenem—tuis te] ‘Mind your own .

business? .

326. Ο major tandem] The scene winds
up with a pretended deprecation of the
severe truths of Damasippus, to whom the
poet submits as the greater madman of the
two, and humbles himself before him ac-
cordingly. Ι think this interpretation
gives more force to the Satire than Da-
cier’s, which Orelli commends, that after
trying to coax the Stoic into silence Ho-
race loses all patience and exclaims, “O
major tandem,” duc.

SATIRE IV.

This Satire is an essay on good living put in the form of precepta delivered to Horace
at second hand by one Catius, who professes to have got them from some sage more
learned in the art, but whom he does not name. Horace meets him accidentally as he
is hurrying away from the Professor's lecture to think over what he has learnt, and to
store it in his mind. Catius recites from memory or from notes what he has heard, and
enters without preface upon the question of the first course. The Professor may be
supposed to have carried his hearers through an entire dinner, “ab ovo usque ad mala”
(S. i. 3. 6 n.). Catius only gives the heads of the lecture and one or two of the sage’s
reflections. The precepts he delivers inflame Horace with a desire to see and hear the
great man himself, and he prays Catius to introduce him. It may be that Horace had
some third person in his eye, but we have no means of knowing who it was. If it be
so, there were those no doubt who would understand the allusion at the time. That it
was Maecenas Heindorf supposes 3 Wieland that Horace meant himself ; Acron says
he meant Nasidienus, but who Nasidienus was we *do not know (S. 8. Introduction).
Conjecture is thrown away. As to the man Catius himself the Scholiasts call him M.
Catius, and Comm. Cruq. (on ver. 47) Catius Miltiades» Cicero, writing to Cassius
(ad Fam. xv. 16) mentions one Catius Insuber, an Epicurean, who was lately dead,
and for whom he expresses some contempt, meant perhaps for the sect he belonged to
more than for himself. Quintilian (x. 1. 124) speaks of a Catius (probably the same as
Cicero’s) as “ in Epicureis levis quidem sed non injucundus tamen auctor est Catius.”
There was therefore in Cicero's time a person of this name who was pretty well known,
and who probably wrote on the opinions of his sect, the Epicuream. The Scholiasta
tell us that he wrote “quattuor libros de rerum natura et de summobono ;'’ and Comm.
Cruq. on ver. 47 says Horace “irridet eum quod de opere pistorio in suo libro scribit
