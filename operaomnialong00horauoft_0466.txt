Maecius (Metius the Scholiasts call him)
Tarpa was the lord-chamberlain of that
day, and lieensed plays before they were
acted. It appears from a letter of Cicero to
Marius (Ad Fam. vii. 1) that he was ap-
pointed to that duty by Cn. Pompeius, on
the opening of his theatre‚ ΛΑΜ). 699. He
is mentioned again in the Ars Poetica
(v. 387), though it is not certain from
that passage that he still retained these
duties. The ‘aedes,’ Comm. Cruq. says,
was “Aedes Apollinis seu Musarum? and
Bentley on Epp. ii. 2. 92, says it was
either the library attached to the Pala-
tine temple of Apollo, or the temple
called ‘ Herculis Musarum,’ rebuilt by
Philip, the step-father of AugustuS, and
· called from him ‘Porticus Philippi? But the
former temple was not built till the autumn
of A.U.c. 726. (C. i. 31, Iut.). The latter
(though this has been denied‚ see Estre,
Prosop. p. 209) was probably the same
temple, restored and beautified, as that
erected to the Muses by Fulvius Nobilior,
about A.U.c. 567. Temples of Apollo and
the Muses are referred to by Juvenal (S.
vii. 37) as the resort of poets, and there
can be no doubt that other temples besides
(Ovid. Trist. iii. 1. 69) had buildings at-
tached where men of letters assembled.
In one of these, therefore, or some build-
ingespecially consecrated to the Muses (for
⁶ aedes ’ in the singular number cannot sig-
nify a private house, nor does the context
admit of that interpretation, which Masson,
Franke, and others give it), poets who had
plays they wished to get represented recited
them, probably in the presence of Tarpa.
Comm. Cruq. says that this duty was com-
mitted to Tarpa in conjunction with five
others. It had previously formed part of the
functions of the aediles, and it was not till
political allusions became common, and the
position of affairs too critical tobear them,
that this special censorship was created.
42. Unus vivorum, Fundani] Of this
Fundanius, who Horace says was the only
man of the day who could write a comedy

letters, Weichert (Poet. Lat. p. 51, n. 41)
conjectures he may have been C. Fun-
danius, an eques who, we are informed by
the author of the Bellum Hispaniense,
(c. 11) deserted Cn. Pompeius, and went
over to C. Caesar. But this is not a very
good argument. He is mentioned with·
Pollio, because the one wrote comedies
and the other tragedies. Fundanius is the
narrator of the scene in S. ii. 8, the supper
of Nasidienus. 1 think it probable Horace
exaggerated his merits as well as Pollio's
out of affection for the men. As to Pollio,
see C. ii. 1, Int., and v. 10 n. “ Pollio's
political greatness might easily dazzle the
eyes of his contemporaries as to the true
value of his poetical works‚” is Schlegel's
opinion (Drama, Leet. xv.) ς and he thinks
that thoug h“ we cannot exactly estimate
the extent of our loss (in the tragedies of
the Augustan age), to all appearance it is
not extraordinarily great? ‚’such
as the‘ saeva Pelopis domus’ (C. i. 6. 8 ιι.).
‘Pede ter percusso ’refers to the trimeter
iambic, the common measure of

to follow them. As applied to a poem itis
supposed by some to be taken from the
process of spinning, which receives support
from Epp. ii. 1. 225: “tenui deducta.
poemata filo,’ and S. ii. 1. 4. “Mille die
versus deduci posse.” Others suppose it to
be applied to a
making of which both in metals a‘nd in
marble the word ‘’ducere is employed.
Whether Virgil had at this time published
his Georgics or not is uncertain, from
the doubt that hangs over both the date
of this Satire and the publication of those
poemS. But at any rate pVirga ‘lhad them· m

great part of them recitedp m private. The
Scholiasta say that virgil appears to have
written the Georgica and Bucolici„ but
they only gather this probably from the
text. The Bucolics had been published
