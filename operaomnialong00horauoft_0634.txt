HORATII FLACCI

The man whose ignorance cannot distinguish the dye of Aquinum from the dye of Sidon

will not more certainly suffer burt than he who consounds truth and error.

He who

is elated by prosperity will be eonfouuded by adversity. If you have specially set
your heart upon a thing, you will be sorry when you lose it. Seek not great things.
, The poor man may be happier than kings and the followers of kings. Take warning
by the horse in the fable: he who forfeits his liberty for money will be a slave all his

life to a hard master. As a shoe trips a man is it be too large, and galls him if too
small, so is it with him whose means do not fit his desires.

Be content and wise, my friend, and when you see me heaping up riches you may chas-

tise me in your turn as you will. Money is the mistress or the servant. It should .
ever be the captive, never the conqueror.

Dated by the ruins of Vacuna: in good spirits, though they would be better if you were

with me.

URBIS amatorem Fuscum salvere jubemus

Ruris amatores, hac in re scilieet una

Multum dissimiles, ad caetera paene gemelli,-

Fraternis animis, quidquid negat alter et alter ;

Annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi. ¹ 5
Tu nidum servas 5 ego laudo ruris amoeni

Rivos et musco circumlita saxa nemusque.

Quid quaeris ⁴? Vivo et regno simul ista reliqui

Quae vos ad caelum fertis rumore secundo,

thue sacerdotis fugitivus liba recuso 3

3. ad caetera] Most of the old editions
have ‘ad caetera‚’ and that is the reading
of all the Parisian‚ the St. Cranen, three
Beme, aud many other MSS. The oldest
Blandinian has ‘ at,’ which Bentley de-
fends, and so does Orelli. [See v. 50.
Ritter and Kriiger have, ‘at cetera pene
gemelli fraternis animis? See v. 50. 1 am
inclined to prefer the· pointing of the text.
The next line means ‘ of a brotherly mind,
whatever one does not like, neither does the
other.’

5. vituli notique columbi] I do not know
whether Horace means to be jocular here;
but the notion of these two middle· -aged
gentlemen billing and cooing like two old
pigeons has something rather absur’d 1n it.
[‘ Noti’ means ‘known to one another?
So ‘vetuli notique' is the same as old
friends] There are some (Dacier‚ Sana-
don, and others) who take ‘noti' to refer
to some well· known story of two doves.

8. Quid quaeris] This is equivalent to
‘yWh need you ask ?’

Orelli' s MSS.

‘ in short?
9. fertis rumore ysecundo]

‘fertis’ has equally good authority, and
appears in nearly all the old editions. Vir-
gil (Aen viii. 90) has‘ ‘Ergo iterinoeptum
celerant rumore seeundo? Tacitus, speak-
ing of the honours conferi-ed on Nero, says

“ut haec secundo rumore ita adversis ani-
mis acceptum quod filio Claudii socer Se-
janus destinaretur” (Anu. iii. 29). He
uses ‘adverso rumore' in the opposite sense
(xiv. 11). Here it means with unanimous
assent.

10. fugitivus liba recuso] He likens
himself to the slave who rau away stom the
priest his master because he fed him too
much on the sweet eakes offered 111 sacri-
fice. He grew tired of them and wanted
plainer food. These cakes, ‘libass which
the Greeks called πέλανοι, were made of
flour sw eeteued generally with honey and
sometimes made 111 the shape of animala as
a substitute for more oostly sacrifices.
Orelli suggests that a scene in some ‘mi-
ffiilds sosstygtkgerynsszrssd 111111111δῖ 3111111108 033
derives the name from ‘ Liber’ (Fast. iii.
