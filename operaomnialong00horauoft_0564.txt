HORATII FLACCI

Furcifer?’' “Ad te, inquam.'’ “Quo pacto, pessime ?’' “Laudas
Fortunam et mores antiquae plebis, et idem
Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat usque recuses,

Aut quia non sentis quod clamas rectius esse,

Aut quia non firmus rectum defendis, et haeres
Nequicquam coeno cupiens evellere plantam.
Romae rus optas, absentem rusticus urbem

Tollis ad astra levis.

Ad coenam laudas securum olus ac, velut usquam

Vinctus eas, ita te felicem dicis amasque
Quod nusquam tibi sit potandum. J usserit ad se
Maecenas serum sub lumina prima venire

Convivam ε ‘ Nemon oleum fert ocius?
Audit ’θ’ cum magno blateras clamore fugisque.

ego credam, furcifer ?”) as a slave who for
some slight offence was obliged to go about
with a ‘furca' round his neck, a sort of
- collar shaped like a V, in which the hands
also were inserted. The master begins to
see that Davus is aiming a stroke at him,
and is growing angry.

23. antiquae plebis] ‘ Plebs' has not its
distinctive meaning in this place. (C. iii.
14. 1 n.) Horace is no doubt tonching his
own infirmity here. He was fond of prais-
ing the simpli‹·ity of the olden time, but
he was not the man to extricate himself
from the degenerata habits of his own day
(‘ nequicquam coeno cupiens evellere plau-
tam,’ which is taken from the Greek pro-
verb ἐκτὸς πηλοῦ πόδα ἔχειν). He had
been but lately perhaps writing the praises
of a country life and sighing for his farm
(in the last Satire) ; but when there we
may believe he felt dull enough, and
missed the society and elegancies of the
city. Whatever his ordinary fare may
have been, he had no objection to the
tables of the rich, and was proud to be
invited to the Esquiliae. It is this good-
tempered raillery of himself that makes
some of Horace’s writings so agreeable,
and the man himself appear so amiable.
There is much humour in this part of the
Satire. He is supposed to be congratu-
lating himself upon being suffered to dine
quietly at home when he gets an unex-
pected invitation from Maecenas to a late
dinner. He immediately shouts for his
lantern, scolds the servants if they keep
him waiting a moment, and runs off as

Etenim fateor me, dixerit ille,

fast as he can, leaving in the lurch some
persons to whom he had promised a din-
ner, and who go away disappointed and
muttering abuse. [Ritter and others also
suppose that ‘ nemon oleum' refer: to the
lantern. But Horace may mean oil for
his hair, as Lambinus interpreted it.]

[24. usque] Doederlein connects ‘ usque'
with ‘ ad illa’ as in S. i. 2. 26, ‘inguen ad
obscoenum subductis usque.']

[30. velut usquam] ‘As if you went
any where on compulsion (vinctus).'—
‘Amasque quod :³ ‘and are well content
that you are not required to drink any
where.⁵]

33. sub lumina prima]
after the lighting of the lamps.' (Epod.
ii. 44 n) The ordinary dinner·hour was
earlier (C. i. 1. 20 n.), but Maecenas’ oc-
cupations protracted his ‘ solidus dies? at
the end of which he might be glad to get
a cheerful companion like Horace to dine
with him. ‘ Blaterare ' is to bawl‚ or more
commonly to babble and talk nonsense.
‘Mulvius' may be any body, one of the
numerous tribe of parasitos. ‘ Non refe-
renda precati‚' uttering curses which the
servants heard but must not repeat. See
last Satire, v. 30, “iratis precibus.” Estre
observes (p. 441): “ Habuit parasitos quo-
que suos Horatius. Quid mirum? Pascebat
Diogenes mures: (Diog. Laert. lib. vi. c.
40). Collocaudos autem censemus infra.
servos.'’ ⁴

37. dixerit ille] Mulvius may be sup-
posed to mutter this, as Horace goes off
and leaves him without his expected din-
