80. Lam et effigies erat, altera cerea]
The meaning of the woollen' image which
was to punish the waxen oue is not very
ele-r. The waxwastomelt, andasit
nelted 80 was the lover to consume in the
fimo of love, according to the witch's
chum inTheocritus (ii. 28). See Epod.

nngfimM— modis] There was
fletwely any imaginable form of cruelty to

which slaves were not liable through the
caprice of their owners, and this of roast-
ingor half roasting alive may have hap -
pared to more than one poor wretch of
this class. Tacitus (Hist. ii. 72) says of a
rmaway slave. “Sumptum de eo suppli-
ciuminservilemmodum? 'andagainof
a steedman of Vitellius (Hist. iv. 11).
“Asiaticus malam potentiam servili sup -
plicio expiavit?¹ The old reading was
‘lutque ‘Ut quae‚’ which Lambinus
strongly denounces, Bentley very properly,
and on good authority, received into his
34. cerpentes—iqs'mae errare canes]
Snakes inber hair, round her waist, and
inber handfor a whip, are insigniaal-

phone. The infernal hounds are those
that Virgil mentium as howling at thie
approach of Hecate (Aen. vi. 257)· .
saeque canes ululare per umbram Adveni-
tante Deass’ So the witch in Theocritus

(ii. 35) knows Hecate is coming by the
howling of the dogs:

must suppose then that aster* part of the
ground was cleared of the bones, there
was still a large cemetery that was lest.
nntouehed, on which there were funeral
monuments. It is instructive to observo
the various ways in which people look at
the same things ς and it is a. n dis-
cipline for thooe who wish to leam. For
this reason, as there is room, I translate
a note by Doederlein ι “ It is impossible
that there could have been great funeral
monuments, behind which the moon could
hide herself, for a. burial ground for the
poor, as it is represented in v. 10, has no
such monuments; and if it had contained
such, they would have been removed when
the place was changed into a park. That
this‘ change was not yet eompleted, as Dil-
lenburger conjectures, is a desperate sug-
gestion, which is hardly satisfactory. If
the moon must hide herself to avoid seeing
the scandal, why does not the poet rather
make her hide behind clouds, which is
certainly more natural? In fact he does
this : we have only to understand ‘quasi,’
as is oflaen the case3 for instance, S. i. 1.
116; 7. 29; ii. 3. 8, 274; and 5. 47. The
masses of clouds, in which she hides her-
self in the heaven, are compared to great
funeral monuments, behind which she
would conceal herself for the same pur·
pose, ff she moved about on the earth? ']
