‘ 9. Quid Titius Romana] The Scho-
liam-sy that Titius was a tragic and lyrie
poet. Acron says that Horace is ridi-
culing 111111101- imitating Pindar, and that
his poetry was worth nothing: “ libri ejus
nullius momenti erant.” Porphyrion, on
the other hand, says he was a person of
great learning, and Comm. Cruq. calls
him Titius Septimius, and that he had
“insigne monumentum infra Ariciam.”
From the last of these notices he has been
su to be the same as Septimius, to
, whom C. ii. 6 is addressed, and whom Ho-
race commenda to Tiberius 111 the ninth
Epistle os this book. Weichert (Poet.
ht. Bel. de Titio Septimio) entertains
this opinion, but the Titia and Septimia
were Roman gentes, and though those who
belonged to Italian families might have
two gentile names, those who belonged to
Romu could not at this time, though in
later times they might. Resides, this
person appears to have been younger than
Septimius. There are several ns of
this family whom we hear of, among others
0118 who held a high command at the battle
of Actium, and was made consul suffectus
that year. But there is 110 0118 upon re-
cord with whom the person 111 1;118 text
ean be identified. Some suppose he may
be the person Tibullus mentions (i. 4. 7 3),

’ “Haec mihi quae canerem Titio Deus

edidit ore.’'

9. venturus in ora] This was pro-
bably a couventional expression, and may
have taken its rise from Ennius’ “ volito
vivu’ per ora virum,’' which Virgil has
imitated. ‘Lacus’ and ‘rivos apertos’

(tanks aud water chaunels) are opposed to
the deep and hidden springs of Pindar's
genius, for which Horace had the greatest
reverence (C. iv. 2, Introduction). ‘Ex-
palluit ’ is used as in C. iii. 27. 27, “medi-
asque finudoe Palluit audax.'’

14. An trayica desaevit et ampullatur]
The first of thoee verbs refers to the pas·
sions represented in tragedy, the other to
the pompous words employed by inferior
writers to express them. ⁸ Ampulla' sig-
nifies a sort of bottle with a big round belly,
and co nds to the Greek λήκυθος,
which was used to signiFy great swelling
words. Horace appears to have been the
first to substitute the Latin words ‘ ampul-
lari' and ‘ ampulla ’ (the first of which he
probably coined) for ληκυθίζειν and λήκυ·
θος. See A. P. 97, ‘⁶ Projicit ampullas et
sesqui 'a verba? Porphyrion says
Horace took the idea from Callimachus,
and he uses the term Μοῦσαν ληκύθειον
(Fr. 319. BL). 1 do not think Orelli is
right in making the point os Aeschylus’
taunt against Euripides (Arist. Rau. 1208)
fitting the words ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν to
every other verse he composcs, to turn
upon the above proverbial use of the word.
He is speaking of his rhythm, particularly
in respect to the use of trisyllabic feet. In
the other sense it wouldbe absurd to make
Aeschylus censure any one as a ληκυθισ-
τής.

15. Quid mihi Celsus agit] ‘Quid
agis ³ is the common formula for ‘how d’ye
do? ' See S. i. 9. 4, “ Quid agis, dulcissime
rerum ?’' and Epp. i. 8. 3, “ Si quaeret
quid agam.'' Celsus is probably Celsus
Albinovanus, to whom the eighth Epistle
is addressed. We know nothing of him

Albinovanus, to whom Ovid wrote one of
his Epistles from Pontus (iv. 10), but it
was not the same man. The advice Horace
here sends him is to write something
