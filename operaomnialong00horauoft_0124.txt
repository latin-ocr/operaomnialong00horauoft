HORATII FLACCI

Insigne maestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti, Pollio, curiae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores 15

Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,

Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

10. mox ubi publicas Res ordinaris]
‘ When you shall have finished your history
of public events? Thus Bentley also takes
it, saying the Greeks used συντάσσειν for
writing a book. Plutarch uses σύνταγμα
for a book. Ἀνατάξασθαι occurs in the
preface to St. Lu‘ke's Gospel, and is thus
rendered in the Vulgate translation, “ Quo-
niam quidem multi eonati sunt ordinare
narrationem '' (quoted by Orelli). The
Scholiast Acron says that Pollio was writing
tragedy at the same time with his history,
and that the style of the oue affected the
style of the other: so that Horace advises
him to lay aside his tragedies in order that
he may do justice to his history. As the
theme is delicate and he is well able to
adorn it, he should put aside his tragedies,
the only obstacle to its proper accomplish-
ment. They were probably of no great
merit. None have survived, and he has
no credit for them, except with Horace
and virgil, who were ‘under pomonal obli-
gations to him. See S. i. 10. 42, and Virg.

terpretation (Adv. x. 21).

21. Audire—videor] ‘ 1 seem to myself
to hear‚' as C. iii. 4. 6. Cicero uses the
word with ‘videre' not unfrequently, as
(de Am. 12) “videre jam videor populum
a senatu disjunctum.” Divin. in Q. caecil.
c. 14: “ Te, Caecili, videre jam videm-‚³³ &c-

23. cuncta terrarum subacta] It is
probable that Pollio had given a very stir-
ring account of Caesar's African campaign,
in which he himself served‚ and that his
description had made a great impression

world. Bentley reads ‘videre' for ‘audii-e?
as being more appropriate to ‘ cuncta term-
rum.' But Horace is plainly referring to
what he had heard Pollio read. The MSS.
have ‘audire.’ [‘ Cuncta terrarnm’ means
the same as ‘cunctas terras? Comp. ‘amara
curarum,' C. iv. 12. 19.
