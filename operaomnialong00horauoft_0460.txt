S. ii. 6. 92. ‘Vin tu,’ that is ‘visne tu‚’
means ‘ surely you will not.’]

¹72. Huncine solem tam myrum surrexe]
‘ Huncine' is compounded of the pronoun,
the demonstrative enclitic ‘ ce ³ (for ‘ ecce,'
‘behold ’), and the interrogative enclitie
‘ne ' (Key's L. G. 293). As to ‘snrrexe,’
see S. i. 5. 79 ς and Terence (Ad. iv. 2.
22), “Nou tu eum rus hinc modo Pro-
duxe aibas i’ ’'

74. Casu venit obvius illi adversarius]
Whether this ‘adversarius' is the same
person who was plaintiff in the action
above referred to has been questioned. The

’ point turns on the expression ‘rapit in jus’
(v. 77). ‘ In jus vocare’ is atechnical ex-
pression having reference to the first step
in a civil action when both parties appeared
before the praetor or other magistratus
having ‘jurisdictio‚’ with the view of fixing
a day for the commencement of the trial.
On this occasion the ‘ vadimonium' above
described was entered into. This first step
was usually avoided by the parties arrang—
ing the day between themselves, and giv-
ing each other security for their attend-
ance. But when the defendant was obsti-
nate and ill-disposed, the ‘ in jus vocatio'
was resorted to. ‘ In jus vocare‚’ therefore,
being the first step, could not follow upon
the neglect of the ‘vadimonium' by Ηο-
race's companion 3 and the ‘ adversarius ’ in
this case cannot be the plaintiff in the
other, unless Horace is speaking loosely.
But as this unprinoipled fellow may very
probably have had plenty of creditore, there
is no reason why Horace's deliverer should
not be a new one sent by Apollo to his
rescue. If we are to suppose the two to be
identicaI, then Horace means that the
plaintiff, not satisfied with the forfeit of
the ‘ vadimonium,' would go through with
the action, and hurried his adversary off to
the praetor. If that be so, Horace uses a
legal term in an unusual way, from want
of accurate knowledge of the language of

the eourts. The above will be found better
stated in Mr. Long's note referred to on v.
36, where the ineonsisteney between Orelli’s
views and his quotations from Plautus is
also shown.

76. Dicet ante-stan] This word significa
the calling a bystander to witness that there
was nothing illegal in the conduct of the
plaintiff in such a case as the above, and
that the defendant had resisted, and that
force was necessary. The process was by
touching the ear of the person whose tes-
timony was asked, who could not be com-
pelled to be a witness, but after he had
consented he was boundto appear and give
evidence if required. Horace was only too
glad to help in the forcible removal of his
persecutor, and gives his earwith allreadi-
ness. The parties begin to wrangle: a Α
crowd of idlers of course forms round them,
and Horace makes his escape. 'mie mean-
ing of ‘injus vocatio' and ‘antestari’ is
marked in a passage of Plautus (Pers. iv.

“ S.. A-ge ambuI'a in jus, leno. D. Quid me

causa, carnifex,

The words of the XII. tables quoted here
by Porphyrion are “SI IN πε ῪΟΟΔΤ, NI
rr, ANTESTATOR. IGITUB EM cumo?
[Dirksen‚ zwfflf.Tafel-Fragmente‚ p. 129]
A Scholiast on Virg. Ec. vi. 4, “ Cyn·
thius aurem Vellit et admonuit? says,
“ Solebant testium aures tenere et ita.
dicere: Memento, quod tu mihi in illa
causa testis eris: quod est antestari?
Pliny (N. H. xi. e. 45. 103) accounts for
the practice by saying the seat of the me-
mory was in the bottom of the ear (‘est
in aure ima memoriae sedes, quam tangen-
tes autestamur’).
