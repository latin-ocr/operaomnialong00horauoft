-EPISTOLARUM

LIBER SECUNDUS.

 

EPISTLE Ι.

Axona other anecdotes connected with Augustus, Suetonius, in his life of Horace, says,
“ Post Sermones quoque lectos, nullam sui mentionem habitam ita est questus: ‘ Irasci
me tibi scito, qnod non in plerisque ejusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. An
vereris ne apud posteros tibi infame sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse ἰν Expres-
sitque elogium, cujus initium est, ‘ cam tot sustineas‚’ '’ sse. Porphyrion, upon Epp.
i. 20, init„ has this note:“ Ex his versibus et in principio sequentis libri apparet
Horatius hoc volumen quasi novissimum totius operis habuisse. Nam secundum episto·
hrum cinctus adjecit 3³³ and at the beginning of this Epistle he says: “Apparet hunc
librum, ut snpra diximus, hortatu Caesaris scriptum esse: cnjus rei etiam Suetonius
auctor est.'’ This Scholiast's authority therefore was probably no other than that
which we' possess in the above memoir‚ which· as early at least as his day was attributed
to Suetonius. But there is no improbability in the story. A similar theory has been
advanced in respect to the sixth Ode of the first book, addressed to Agrippa, which,
like this Epistle, deprecatos the task of attempting the praisffl of a great man. Assu-
r ming the truth of Suetonius' statement, we must place the date of this Epistle aster
the publication of the first book. It is generally supposed, with some probability, that
the Secular Ode was in Horace's mind when he wrote v. 132 sq. lf·so, the Epistle
was not written till aster ΔΑΜ). 737. Beyoud this there are no safe data for fixing the
time of composition. [Ritter concludes that this Epistle was begun at the end of
sanc. 742, and sent to Augustus about the end of 743. The foundation of his argu-
ment is v. 16, ‘jurandasque tuum per numen‚' as he reads that line; and he fixae the
date of the altar' of Augustus at Lugdunum in ΛΑΜ). ’742 or 1³.c. 12. Suetonius
(Claud. 2) says that the altar was dedicated on the first of August B.c. 10, on the
birth-day of Claudius, who was born at Lugdunum. Dion Cassius (54. c. 32) speaks
of the festival at the altar of Lugdunum as existing in 13.c. 12, and he does not speak
of the altar being then dedicated. We should rather infer from him that it was dedi-
cated before Le. 12. Livy's Epitome 137 places the dedication after the disturbance
in Gallia on account of the census, and this appears to be in B.c. 12. Clinton suggests
that Suetonius means the anniversary of the dedication 3 but that is certainly not the
meaning of his words.]

Horace begins by excusing himself for not having written before (supposing the
truth of the above story) by the great labours and anxieties of Augustus, on whose
attention it was not for him to intrude. He goes on to commend the discrimination
of the people, who, contraryto that usual practice by which great men are loaded with
envy and abuse when alive and with honours only aster they are dead, had recognized
Augustus' divinity already. But having given the age that credit, he reproaches their
