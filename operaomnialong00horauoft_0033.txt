INTRODUCTION. xxix

ipsius habui ostendi ’' (on S. i. 6. 41). The same Scholiast refers more
than once to books that had been written on the persons mentioned by
Horace. A reference to Estre's work spoken of in the Prefaoe will
show that a catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin-
guished men of the day, with most of whomgfloraoe was on friendly
tel-ms.

The Metres adopted by Horace from the Greek are thirteen in
number in the Odes, and six in the Epodes. 1 purpose saying only a
few words on each.

C. i. l.—The metre of this Ode is oue of three, called aster .

Asclepiades, a lyric poet of uncertain date. It consiste of single lines
divided thus t

sse caesura usually fixlls on the long syllable after the end of the
¹second foot. There are two exceptions only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and
iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did not follow this rule, and their lines were
less monotonous in consequence. The division of this metre by
choriambi is against the obvious rhythm. C. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to
the same.

G. i. 2.—This metre takes its name from Sappho. It consists of
stanzas of four verses each. The first three are alike, and consist of
four trochees, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always sub-
stitutes a spondee for the second trochee, with one uncertain exception,
C. S. 70. The fourth verse consiste of a dactyl and spondee, and is
named an Adonio.

This is one of the commonest metres. It differs in Horace's hands
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trochee
in the second place, and from the caesura usually falling after the
fifth syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from the
vigour of the metre, a defect which Horace seems to have perceived

when he wrote the Carmen Saeculare and the Sapphic Odes of the
fourth book ⁷.

ἰ’ Ι subjoin some remarks from the “ Journal of Education‚'' 1832 (vol. iv. p. 356),
on Dr. Carey’s “ Latin Prosody made Easyff’ The author observes ε “ It greatly con·
duces to the harmony of the Sapphic verso to make the caesura at the fisth semifooss, as
‘Dive, quem proles Niobea magnae ;’ not as ‘ Haec J ovem sentire Deosque cunctos: ’'
- —a very common opinion. To which the reviewer replies: “ To our ears the latter is at
least as melodicus as the former, consisting of a dactyl interposed between two accentual
ditrochees, as in the lines quoted by Dr. Carey from Catullus and Sappho:

⁸ roanzMOpov’ ἀθάνατ’ Ἀφροδίτα.’
‘ Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ;’
