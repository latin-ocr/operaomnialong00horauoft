240 ⁷ HORATII FLACCI ’

Si chartae sileant quod bene feceris

Mercedem tuleris.

Quid foret Iliae

Mavortisque puer si taciturnitas

Obstaret meritis invida Romuli?

Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum 25
Virtus et favor et lingua potentium

Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.

Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori :

Caelo Musa beat.

Sic J ovis interest

Optatis epulis impiger Hercules,

Clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis

Quassas eripiunt aequoribus rates,
Ornatus viridi tempora pampino
Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.

sta-nd, these words refer to Scipio Africanus
Minor ; and that they do so may be inferred
from S. ii. 1. 65, where he is mentioned in
the same way as the man

20. Calabrae Pierides] The muse of
Calabria, i. e. of Ennius, who was born at
Rudiae, a Calabrian town. He wrote, as
observed above, a poem on the elder Scipio.

25. Aeacum] The praises of Aeacus and
his family are frequent in Pindar, particu-
larly in connexion with the island of Aegina.
(Pyth. viii. 21 sqq. Nem. iii. 28. Isthm. vii.
23, ἕω). ‘Virtus et favor’ are generally

taken like ‘lingua’ as belonging to ‘poten-⁷
tium vatum’ so that ‘ virtus’ is ‘ vis in-
genii, facultas poetica.’ I rather think the
meaning is that, though Aeacus was vir-
tuous (and he was much celebrated for his
justice), his virtue would not have raised
him to the skies but for the applause won
him by the poets3 the causes therefore are
his virtue and the public esteem (favor),
and the poet's praise that made hisvirtue
known. The other heroes are those men-
tioned in a former ode (iii. 3). Concern-
ing the ‘ divites insulae,’ see Epod. xvi. 42.
The last line is only a way of expressing
the apotheosis of Liber.—Hermann has re-
constructed this ode with more even than
his usual boldness. (See Orelli’s Excursus.)

OARMEN IX.

aaa. 737 (Ρ).

It is singular that the ode which of ull others dwells most on the moral virtues of the
person addressed should be written to one whose moral character has been so much
blackeued as that of M. Lollius. The integrity which Horace so highly commends is
that particular virtue in which, according to the testimony of the histor-ian Velleius·
(ii. 97. 102), and of Pliny (N. H. ix. c. 35), and of the emperor Tiberius (Tac. Ann. iii.
48), he was most wanting. But he was a personal enemy of the emperor, and Velleius was
Tiberius’ worst flatterer. Pliny wrote what he heard, and this would come down through
