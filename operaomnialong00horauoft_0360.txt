324 HORATII FLACCI

ARGUMEN'P.

Maecenas, why is it that no man is content with his own lot, but every one envies his
neighbour? The weary soldier envies the trader 3 the trader 011 the stormy deep
envies the soldier ς the jurisconsult‚ impatient of his early client, envies the country-
man, who dragged up to town by a law suit envies the inhabitants of the town.
There is no end to the instances. Well, suppose some god were to offer them their
wish, and bid them change places,—they would refuse it 1 What hinders the wrath
of heaven from visiting these murmurers, and the ears of Jove being closed against
them for ever Ρ But to be serious (though truth may be told in jest), the toiliug
ploughman, the cheating host, the soldier, the venturous trader, pretend their only
object is to secure a provision for old age, like the ant provident of the future. But
she retires when the winter comes, and enjoys her store 3 while winter and summer, fire,
sword, and waves obstruet not your pursuit of wealth. What is the use of treasure
which you hide like a coward in the ground ‘r‘ “ O, but if you take from it you will
soon reduce it to nothing.'’ Be it so3 but if you do not, what charm has the pile of
coin Ρ If you thresh thousands of bushels of corn, you cannot eat more than I can. The
slave that carries the bread eats no more than he who carries none. Live within the
bounds of nature, and a hundred acres are as good as a thousand. “But it is so
pleasant to take what you want from a huge heap!'’ Nay, I do not see why my
baskets are not 88 good as your barus, if I can take as much from my store as you
from yours. You might as well prefer to draw a cup of water from the swollen
Aufidus rather than from the little stream by your side ς but so you may find that your
life is the penalty of your greediness, while another gets his water clear, and keeps
his life from drowning. But most men think they never can have enough. The more
you have, say they, the more you will be thought of. Now what is to be done with
a man of this sort Ρ You can only leave him in the misery 110 prefers ; as the miser
at Athens, when the people hissed him, said, “ Never mind3 1 look at my money-
box when Ι get home, and applaud myself.'’ Tantalus catches at the retreatiug
waters—why smile Ρ Change the name, and the story belongs to you. Even thus
you gloat over your money as you would gaze at a lovely picture, but you dare not
use it. What is the use of money? To buy the necessaries of life. To lie awake
and tremble for thieves, is this your happiness? Save me from such happiness!
“ But if you are rich you have anxious friends to nurse you in sickness.” Nay, you
have not one. Your wife and children, your neighbours, and all the town detest you.
How should it be otherwise Ρ You prefer your money 1ο them. Suppose you were
to bestow a little pains in keeping the affections of your kindred—-a blessing nature
has given you at no eost of yours—would it be all lost labour Ρ 111 short, oease your
getting ε having more than enough, enjoy what you have got, and remember the fate
of Ummidius the miser. “ Well, but what does all this mean P am Ι to be a spend-
thrift like some we know? ” Nay, this is only to bring opposite extremes into com-
parison: all things have their limite, on either side of which right cannot stand.
So I go back to what Ι began with—that greedy men are always dissatisfied and
envy others3 and instead of comparing themselves with those who are poorer, are
always hastening to overtake some one abead of them, like the driver in the chariot
race; so that few retire from life as satisfied guests from a banquet‚ acknowledging
with thankfulness the blessings they have enjoyed. But enough, or you will say 1
have ransacked Crispinus’ desk. '
