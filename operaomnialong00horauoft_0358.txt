HORATII FLACCI EPODON LIBER, 17.

Optat Prometheus obligatus aliti,

Optat supremo collocare Sisyphus

In monte saxum 3 sed vetant leges J ovis.

Voles modo altis desilire turribus, 70
Modo ense pectus Norico recludere,

Frustraque vincla gutturi nectes tuo

Fastidiosa tristis aegrimonia.

Vectabor humeris tunc ego inimicis equeS,
Meaeque terra cedet insolentiae. 75
An quae movere cereas imagines,

Ut ipse nosti curiosus, et polo

Deripere lunam vocibus possim meis,

Possim crematos excitare mortuos

Desiderique temperare pocula, 80
Plorem artis in te nil agentis exitus ⁴?

And Hypsipyle says of Medea (Ovid. He-

Orelli edits ‘nectes' with Bentley, who

· says Horace, if he had written ‘innectes’

would have said ‘vinclis’ and ‘guttur-3
ev'r'rvamacrss might easily, as Orelli
says, be read —‘ gutturi innectes ς’ but he is
not sure which Horace wrote, and is not
much inclined to desert his best MSS. B
and the Ziirich. Dillenbr. has ‘innectes'
The steel of Noricum (Carinthia and
Styria) is mentioned C. i. 16. 9.

74. Vectahor humeris] She threatens
to bestride his shoulders in triumph, and
to spurn the earth in the pride of her re·
venge. I doubt the correctness of Forcel-
lini’s interpretation of ¹ insolentiae,’ which
Orelli adopts: “novis ausis, insolitis ac
novis viribus, quibus ulciscar et deprimam
omnes?

76. movere cerea-s· imagines] To give
life to waxen images made to represent an
absent youth, and inspired with the ten-
derness or the pains he should feel. In
S. i. 8. 30, such an image is introduced

(see note), and the witch in Theocritus (ii. ι

28) melts a waxen image, aud says.

ὡς τοῦτον τὸν καρὸν ἐγὼ συν δαίμονι
ὧςτίτίῖοιθ“ ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ὁ Μύνδιος αὐτίκα
Aemus,

which virgil has imitated in 1118 eighth
Eclogue (v. 81) :—

“ Limus ut hic durescit, et haec ut cera

Uno eodemque igni, sic nostro Daphnis
amore.''

roid. vi. 91) :—

“ Devovet absentes simulacraque cerea
Etfigigerum tenues 111 Jecur urget acus.'’

¹78. Deripere] The variations of the
MSS. in the last lines are numerous. There
is as usual ‘diripere’ for ‘deriperess of
which the latter alone can be admitted ς
and ‘possum' for ‘possim.’ Most of the
MSS„ and all the old editions of the
thirteenth century, have the subjunctive,
which is right. [“ Shall 1, who have the
power (‘quae possim ’), or though 1 have
the power, ἀφ, bewail the results of an art
ineffectual towards thee Ρ ”] ‘ Poculum’ is
the reading of some MSS. of weight, and
of all the editions Ι have seen, till Bentley
introduced ‘pocula’ [Keller has‘ pocu-
lum. ³] I see no particular reason for pre-
fer-ring either3 one reason which weig hed
with some, though Ι see no force 111 it,‘ 1s
removed by the reading ‘exitus’ for‘ exi-
tum‚’ which was supposed to jingle with
poculum? The plura] ‘exitus’ appears
in Orelli's three Berne MSS„ and is the
reading, among others, of Torrentius, who
has ‘habentis ' for ‘agentis.' ‘Nullum
habentis exitum’ is Lambinus’ reading,
‘Nil habentis exitum’ that of the Vene-
tian (1483). ‘Nil valentis exitum’ is that
of Sanadon and others; ‘nil agentis ’of
the three Berne and z’urich and others.
[Ritter 1188 ‘exitum.'] This is a mmmon
expression in Horace, and it appears to
me the most suitable reading here, with at
least as good authority as any other.
