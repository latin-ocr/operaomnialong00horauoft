646 HORATII FLACCI

Vina fere dulces oluerunt mane Camenae. 5
Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus 3
Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma

Prosiluit dicenda.

“ Forum putealque Libonis

Mandabo siccis, adimam cantare severis :²³

Hoc simul edixi non cessavere poe‘tae , 10
Nocturno certare mer0, putere diurno.

Quid, si quis vultu torvo ferus et pede nudo

Virtutemne repraesentet moresque Catonis?

of Dionysus· (See Pind. Ol. xiii. 18.) In
C. i. 12. 21 he is spoken of as ‘proeliis
audax,' with reference to the wars of Bac-
chus with the giants and in India. In the
ode celebrating the praises of Dionysus
(C. ii. 19) we have “Evoe, parce Liber,
Parce, gravi metuende thyrso;’' and be-

low (Epp. ii. 1. 5) his apotheosis is spoken
of (as also in C. iv. 8. 34), where there is
the additional confusion that he is called
q by his essentially Latin title ‘ Liber pater?

But though the poets confound these
names, Liber was a Latin divinity, while
Dionysus was entirely Greek; and when
the orgies of Dionysus were introduced
into Italy they were expelled again, the
Liberalia, an innocent and cheerful festi-
val, being substituted for the impure rites
of the Dionysia.

5. Vina fere dulces] The ancients did
not spare the reputation of their poets in
this matter ς for besides the fame of Crati-
nus mentioned above, Alcaeus, Anacreon,
Aeschylus, Aristophanes, and many others,
are said to have indulged freely in wine.
As to Homer, there is no foundation in his
poetry for Horace's absurd statement.
David might as well be charged with ex·
cess because he speaks of wine as making
glad the heart of man. Ennius said of
himself that he only wrote when he had
got the gout· “Nunquam poetor nisi
podagerl'

8. Forum pateatque Libonis] See S. ii.
6. 35 n. Horace speaks as if he had de-
livered an ‘edictum' that the business of
the Forum was only fit for the sober and
dull, who had nothing to do with poetry ‚-
whereupon all who would be thought
poets took to drinking day and night.
The old editions, and a large number of
MSS. have. ‘ edixit? Bentley restored
‘ edixi,' for which there is ample authority.
‘Patere’ is a sti-onger‘ word for ⁴ olere?

used above, v. 5.

12. Quid, siquis vultu torvo] Cato of
Utica is here referred to, of whom Plutarch
says that from his childhood he showed in
his voice. and countenance, and also in his
amusements, an immovable, unimpres-
sive, aud firm temper. He seldom laughed
or even smiled; and, though not pas-
sionate, when his anger was roused it was
not easy to pacify him. He set himself
against the fashions of the times' m dress
as in other things, and osten went out of
doors after dinner without his shoes and
tunic; and the fashion being to wear a
‘lacerna' of bright colour, he chose to
wear a dark one. (Cat. o. 1. 6.) He
may have worn his toga of smaller dimen-
sions than other people, from the same
dislike to the usages of the day. [‘ If he
should imitate Cato by the help of the
man who makes for him a scanty .’
Ritter supposes that the elder Cato is
alluded to, which, I think, is not s0.]

15. Eup it Iarbitam Timaqenis The
person here called Iarbitas was a auri·
tanian by birth, and his Roman name was
Cordus or Codrus. (Scholiast quoted by
Cruquius m his Supplement, and by Fea.)
Timagenes was a native of Alexandria,
where he was taken prisoner by A. Gabi-
nius and sold as a slave. He was sent to
Rome and bought by Faustus, the son of
Sulla, who gave him his freedom. He
afterwards taught rhetoric, and came into
favour with Augustus, but was so free with
his tongue that he offended his patron,
and was forbidden his house. He aster-
wards ingratiated himself with Asinius
Pollio, who gave him a home in his house
at Tusculum, where he died. 'rho Scho-
liasts agree in saying that Cordus, mlled
Iarbitas (whether by Horace in joke or
generally by his contemporaries, from
Virgil’ s Numidian king Iarbas, en eavour-
