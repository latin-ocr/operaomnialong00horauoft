46 HORATII FLACCI.

Incontinentes injiciat manus

Crinibus immeritamque vestem.

GARMEN XVIII.

There is preserved iu Athenaeus, x. p. 430, a single line of Alcaeus, of which the first
verse of this ode is almost a literal translation. The metre also is the same. The verse
is as follows (44 Bergk) : μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἆμπέλω. The rest of
the ode is, in all probability, a close adaptation of the poem of Alcaeus. If we were not
put upon the right scent, as I think we are, by the above fragment, we should suppose
Horace had a friend Varus, who had a villa at Tibur, and who was making· a plantation
there. Varus was the cognomen of his and Virgil's friend Quintilius, whose death is
lamented in C. xxiv. of this book. But whether or ιιο he is the person here referred
to, or (which appears to Buttmann, and 1 agree with him, the better way of putting it)
whose name is used for the purpose of giving spirit to the ode, itis quite impossible to
say. “Sterilem agrum frustra rimeris,' ’as Franke judiciously says on another equally
impossible question. It has been doubted whether Horace wrote ‘’Vare or‘ vere,’ in
consequence of a note which appears in the two Scholiasts‚ Acron and Comm. Cruq„

“suadet ut cum vernum competens tempus est nullam arborem prius quam vitem ponat,”
from which it has been inferred that they had‘ vere' in their copies. Some confirma-
tion of this theory‘ ι5 derived from Virg. Georg. ii. 319 sq.. ·--

“Optima vinetis satio cum vere rubenti
Candida venit avis longis invisa colubris.'’

All existing MSS. and editions have ‘Vare.' Jahn affirms that the person is ‘haud
dubie,' the same as Canidia's old lover, Epod. v., and Weichert (de L. Varii et Cassii
Parmensis vita) says the same. Such boldness appears to me most irrational. The
respectable names of these scholars have misled the writer of the article Varus (xii.) in
Smith’s Dict. Biog„ who might have corrected his judgment by referring to Estrfi, to
whose work he refers others. , ’

Torrentius believes the person to be that unfortunate Varus whose legions were cut
off by Arminius in Germany, ΔΛ). 10. But as he supposes Catullus to have addressed
the same person (C. x.), who was his junior by at least half a century, his judgment is
worth nothing. Other conjectures have been hazarded by scholars of repute, which
Estre has stated and disposed of very clearly.

“Of Quintilius’ Villa ruins yet remain at 'rivoli‘ m the quarter called aster him Quin-
tigliolo,'’ says Fea, a credulous but industrious commentator.

ARGUM ENT.

The vine is the first tree thou shouldst plant, Varus, by the walls of Tibur. Hardships
are only for the sober, wine drives away all cares. Who croaks of battles and poverty
, rather than of Bacchus and Venus, when he is mellow Ρ But that no man exceed,
let him think of the bloody frays of the Centaurs, and Lapithae, and of the Thraciam,
