12. Laevinum, Valeri genus] The Va-
leria ‘ gens' was one of the most ancient
in Rome, and embraced some of the most
distinguished families, among others that
of Publicola, the earliest member of which
mentioned in history is Valerius Publicola,
the eolleague of Brutus after the expulsion
of the kings. The family of Laevinus was
another branch of the same gens, the most
conspicuous of whom were P. Valerius
Laevinus, who conducted the war against
Pyrrhus, and M. Valerius, who in the
. second Punic war was governor of Sicily.
of the Laevinus in the text we know no-
thing but from the text and the Scholiasts
Porphyrion and Comm. Cruq., who say
that he was a man of most abandoned cha-
racter, so bad that even the populace, who
were not easily deterred from conferring
their honours upon the vicious, could not
be prevailed on by admiration of his high
ancestry to advance him beyond the quae-
storship 3 that is to say, he never held a
curule office. ‘ Valeri genus ' is like ‘ au-
dax Iapeti genu3‚' C. i. 3. 27 n. On ‘undeff
which is equivalent to ‘ a quo,' see G. i. 12.
17 n.; ii. 12. 7. ‘Fugit' is the reading
of the best MSS„ including all the Blan-
dinian and others of high authority quoted
by Lambinus, Orelli, Fea, Bentley, the
three last of whom have adopted it, I think
rightly. Most of the older editions have
‘ fuit ;’ but there is no objection to the use
of the present tense: it is the historic.
‘ Licere’ is ‘to be put up for sale? and the
correlative term* is ‘ liceri‚’ ‘to bid for an
article at a sale by auctione ‘Notare’ is
to set a bad mark upon, to brand, and was
technically applied to the censors (v. 20 n.).
‘ J udice quo nosti ' is an instance of attrac-
tion, which figure the Romans borrowed
from the Greeks, but did not use so com-
monly. See Key’s L. G. 1061, and add
Terence, Heaut. i. 1. 35 ε “Scire hoc vis Ρ
Hac quidem de causa qua dixi tibi ;'’ and
Cicero (ad Fam. v. 14): “cum scribas et
aliquid agas eorum quorum consuesti gau-

Quid oportet

deo.” The editions of the fifteenth cen-
tury all have ⁸ quo,' and that is the read-
ing of Ascensius (1519). The edition of
Aldus of the same year, and nearly au sub-
sequent editions till Bentley, have ‘ quem‚’
for which there is no authority among the
MSS. now existing or known to have been
collated. ‘Titulis et imaginibus’ were
inscriptions and waxen busts recording the
distinctions of any member of a family who
had borne a curule office. See Polyb. vi. 53.

[13. unius assis, δια] ‘ Was never valued
one penny more :³ Ritter, Doederlein,
Kriiger. ‘ Pluris ’ must be taken with
‘ lieuisse‚’ and ‘pretio ’ is not the ablative
directly dependent on ‘pluris-³ This seems
better than the explanation in the Argu-
ment.

17.]Quid oportet mesfacere] Bentley
says he certainly never saw any thing
“pravius tetriusque '' (epitheta it is hard
to understand, especially the latter) than
this reading ‘ nos.' He therefore proposes
‘vos :' “Vos dico A tos, Maecenates,
Polliones, Messallas, ἄεξ’ It is the ffishion
with some critics to exclaim against all
manifestations of sels-satisfaction, however
legitimate the occasion, and to explain
away and alter passages in which Horace
says a word for himself. But there is
neither pride nor humility here. He means

to say that those who by education and ·

profession and experience were very far
removed from the common people ought
to judge differently from them, and better.
In this number he was quite justified in
placing himself. The MSS. are unanimous
in favour of ‘nos.’ The MSS. nearly allread
‘longe longeque 3’ a few have ‘longe la-
teque,' which is the reading of all the old
editions. Cruquius first edited ‘longe
longeque,' quoting Cicero (de Fiun. ii.
21) ε “ plurimum se, et longe longeque
plurimum, tribuere honestati? Ovid uses
the same expression (Met. iv. 325) : “ Sed
longe cunctis longeque potentior illis.’' lt
occurs also in Dig. 4. 4. 39. “Vendentibus
curatoribus minoris fundum emptor exstitit
Lucius Titius et sex fere annis possedit, et
