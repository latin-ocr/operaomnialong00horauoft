HORATII FLACCI

Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum,

Mane domum veniant.

Quid tum?
Verba facit leno : Quidquid mihi, quidquid et horum

Venere frequentes. 230

Cuique domi est, id crede tuum, et vel nunc pete vel cras.
Accipe quid contra juvenis responderit aequus:
In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus ut aprum

Coenem ego ς tu pisces hiberno ex aequore verris.

of the city that lay between Mons Capito-
linus and Mons Aventinus, from the Tiber
to the Circus Maximus. The Tuscus re-
ceived the name, according to Livy (ii. 14)
and Dion. Halic. (v. 36), from a. body of
fugitives from Porsena's army, who were
hospitably entertained by the Romans, and
allowed to occupy this street. It appears
to have been filled with shops, some appa-
rently of the better sort. Martial speaks
of the richest silks being sold in the Vicus
Tuscus (xi. 27. 11) ς “ N ec nisi prima velit
(amica) de Tusco serica vico.” But in
Plautus' day the worst characters were
found there (Curcul. iv. 1. 21) : “ In Tusco
vico, ibi sunt homines qui ‘ipsi sese vendi-
Tbe Velabrum is said by Varro

from the verb ‘ vehere,' because the ground
was originally a swamp traversed by boats.
Here too “prostabant omnia quae ad victus
rationem atque delicias pertinebant ’'
(Comm. Cruq.). There were in earlier times
different markets sor the sale of different
provisions, as the ‘ forum boarium’ for oxen,
‘olitorium' for vegetableS, ‘piscarium’ and
‘piscatorium’for fish, ‘cupedinis’ for deli-
czrcies, dcc. All these were afterwards trans-
ferred to one large market on the site of the
‘ forum cupedinis,' on the north side of the
Sacra Via, not far from the Forum Roma-
num. This market was called Macellum,
the diminutive form of ‘maceria‚' the wall
with which it was surrounded (Cic. in
Verr. ii. 3. 62, Mr. Long's note). See
Terence (Eun. ii. 2. 24) :—

“ — interea loci ad Macellum ubi ad-
venimus,
Concurrunt laeti mi obviam cupediarii
omnes,
Cet-arii, lanii, coqui, fartores, piscatoreS.''

‘ Fartores ' Becker (Gallus, sc. ix. n.) says
were σιτεῦται, whose business was to fatten
fowls. The ‘ scurrae,' parasites‚ were sent
for to help to consume all this quantity of
provisions, and to entertain the new heir.
230. Quid tum] This is the reading of
all but a very few MSS. Bentley found
‘ qui tum ' in one, and changed it to ‘qui
eum,' which reading has since been found

235

in three MSS. by Fea, who adopts it. ‘Quid
enim ?' is another various reading 3 ‘quid
tu P’ a third3 but this is only ‘ quid tum ’
with the mark (ῡ) omitted. The common
reading is not likely to have been in-
troduced if Horace wrote ‘qui cum?
[‘ Verba facit :’ ‘is the spokesman? Cicero
uses both ‘ verbum ¹ and ‘ verbafacere.']

232. vel nunc pete vel cras] This
sounds like a conventionalism for ‘ when-
ever you please.’

233. aequus] This is ironical. The
young man, affecting to be just, shows a
wauton extravaganee towards the most
profligate persons.

234. In m‘ve Lucana] Bentley puts
‘tu’ for ‘in ;’ but the pronoun does not
appear in any MS. Dramatic transitions
like this are effected, not by pronouns, but
by turning to the person addressed. It
appears from this passage and S. 8. 6, that
Lucanian boars were particularly prized.
Martial mentions an Etrurian boar as a
great present he had received. Horace, in
the next Sat-ire (ver. 40) recommends the
Umbrian boar above the Laurentina, or
that found in the mar-shy land on the
coast of Latium, in the neighbourhood of
Laurentum. The Umbrian and the Luca·
nian boar were fed upon the acorns and
chestnuts of the Apennines, which are still
considered in Italy the best food for hogs,
wild and tame. The boar was usually
served up whole at large tables, and formed
the principal dish. The ‘ocrea’ was a
leather gaiter that came up tothe knee and
round the ealf like the soldier-'s greaves.

— [‘Aprum coenem ε’ Ep. i. 5. 2, ⁴ coenare
olus?

2353. verri-5] Many MSS. and the old
editions have ‘vellis,’ which Acron (who
mentions the reading ‘verris ¹) explains
“ cum difficultate trabis.'' Crnquius says
all his MSS. have ‘vex-ris? which Lam-
binus also adopts. Bentley does the same
and most modern editors. See note on S.
4. 37. Silius uses ‘verro’ in this sense
(xiv. 262) :—

“ Seu silvis sectere feras, seu retibus aequor
Vertere seu caelo libeat traxisse volucrem .”
