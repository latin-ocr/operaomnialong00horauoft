HORATII FLACCI

Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum ⁷

Lucana mutet pascuiS,

Neque ut superni villa candens Tusculi

Circaea tangat moenia.

Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit: haud paravero

Quod aut avarus ut Chremes terra. premam,
Discinctus aut perdam nepos.

‘meis' (v. 26) are both supported by au-
thority3 the latter was generally adopted
till Bentley edited ‘ mea,’ rightly observing
that the possessive pronoun ought to be
joined with the nearer substantive, and
that the two adjectives ‘ meis ’ and ‘ plu-
ribus' agreeing with ‘juvencis’ are bad.
[Ritter and Keller have ‘ meis.'] The
editors generally understand Horace to be
alluding to the rewards of service in the
field. He appears ratherto be impressing
on Maecenas that he wishes to follow him
not for his bounty but his love.

28. pascuis] Several MSS. have ‘pas-
*cua.,' which Torrentius prefers, though all
his MSS. have ‘pascuis' I do not see
much force in Bentley’s objection that with
‘pascua’ we should have three lines all
ending alike, ‘nitantur mea‚' ‘mutet pas-
cua,’ ‘tangat moenia‚’ and Ι have some
difficulty in choosing. I have followed the
later editors. ‘Mutet’ is used as it is
elsewhere by Horace. See C. i. 17. 2 n.
Varro (de Re Rust. ii. 1. 16) says, “Gre-
ges ovium longe abiguntur ex Apulia in
Samnium aestimtum, atque ad publicanum
profitentur ne si inscriptum pecus paverint
lege censoria committant‚’' where ‘ inscrip-
tum’ means ‘ unregistered‚’ it being re-
quired that the cattle put to graze on the
public lauch should be registered with a
view to the payment of the tax (scriptura).
Cic. Verr. ii. 2. 70, Long's note. The
plains of Calabria were hot (‘· non aestuo-
sae grata Calabriae armenta? C. i. 31. 5),
and the woody hills of Lucania formed a
pleasant contrast in summer.

29. Neque ut] The older editions have
‘nec.’ ‘ Nor that 1 may have a white
marble villa near the walls that Telegonus
built, the walls of Tusculum on the hill.³
He says he does not want a villa at Tuscu—
lum where there were many handsome
houses besides that of Lucullus. See Cic.
de Legg .iii. 13. The ancient Tusculum,
Fea says, was built on the top of the hill,
but the modern town, Fraseati, is on the
slope. Fea says he has frequently seen the
ruins of the old town, w hich was destroyed

Λα). 1181 in the civil wars. ‘Circaea’ is
explained by C. iii. 29. 8 ιι. Bentley con-
jectures ‘ supini ' for ‘ supemi,’ referring
to “Tibur supinum,'’ C. iii. 4. 23. But
there is no variation in the MSS„ and even
if what Bentley says were true, that ‘ su-
perni’ could only be used relatively, we¹
may imagine that the higher part of the
town (“superius Tusculum,’' as Gesner
says) was more agreeable than the lower.
But the word is used absolutely. It is
extraor dinary that the explanation of Lam-

binus should have found favour with so
intelligent an editor as Doering, ‘that the
buildings on my farm should be extended
and reach to Tusculum? which was fifteen
miles off. Lambinus says he speaks in an
hyperbole, as he certainly would if that
were his meaning. Many editors have
adop ted that notion and Porphyrion

caea tangat moenia: Tusculum intelligen-

dum. Sensus est autem ut neque in Tus-

culo possideam villam quae ibi aedificia
habeat usque ad ipsam urbem. ’³ Others
after Acron (Turnebus, xii. 14) think of
a villa and farm reaching from 'I‘usculum
to Circaei' ιιι Latium, taking ‘villa Tus-

culi' tog ether. [‘ Candensz’ S. i. 5. 26.]

31. Satis superque] Epod. xvii. 19: and
C.' 1i. 18. 12- , iii. 16. 38.

33. Chremes] The allusion is perhaps to
a character in some play of Menander.

34. perdam nepos] This is amore agree-
able reading than the common one ‘ut
nepos’ [which Ritter and Keller have]. -
It has the authority of Orelli's B. ‘Ut ’
is not omitted by any editor earlier than
Orelli, and the question is not raised by
any earlier commentator that Ι have seen.
The Scholiast Porphyrion had‘ ut’ in his
copy, and the oldest known MS„ the Blan-
dinian of Cruquius, must have had it, or he
would have notieed the omission. Never-
theless it is probable that 'Horace wrote

‘perdam nepos‚' and that the second ⁶ ut ’
was inserted by copyists to coi-respond tc
the first. Comp. S. i. 1. 101.
