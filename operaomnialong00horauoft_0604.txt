568 HORA'PII FLACCI

Privatas ut quaerat opes, et tangere vitet
Scripta Palatinus quaecunque recepit Apollo,
Ne si forte suas repetitum venerit olim
Grex avium plumas moveat cornicula risum

Furtivis nudata coloribus.

Ipse quid audes? 20

Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma? Non tibi parvum
Ingenium, non incultum est et turpiter hirtum.

Seu linguam causis acuis seu civica jura

Respondete paras seu condis amabile carmen,

Prima feres hederae victricis praemia.

Quodsi 25

Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posses,

Quo te caelestis sapientia duceret ires.

Hoc opuS‚ hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli

Si patriae volumus, si nobis vivere cari.

Debes hoc etiam rescribere, si tibi curae 3ο

original, and not confine himself to the
ideas of other authors, either in the way
of translation or imitation. Augustus
(C. i. 31, Introduction) attached a library
*tn the t’emple 116 built for Apollo on tlse
Mons Palatinus. Aesop’ s fable of the
jackdaw, who dressed himself' 111 the pea-
cock’s cast-off feathers‚ is told by Phaedrus
(i. 3). Αἶα-ὧπιος κολοιός was a proverb.

21. Quae circumvolitas] This similitude
of a bee gathering honey from thyme is
applied by Horace to himself (C. iv. 2. 27
11.). As to ‘ orator ' and ‘ respondere‚’ see
S. i. 1. 9 11., and on ‘hederae praemia‚’
see C. i. 1. 29.

23. seu civica jura respondere] Pliny
has “jus civile respondere ’³ (Epp. 6, 15).
[The usual form of expression is ‘de jure
respondere,' or ‘jus respondere‚' both of
which Cicero uses] >

26. Frigida curarum fomenta] Some
{mih-&¹22 ssssi’fisstflssngssiniissiefflff
which seiam to foster (‘fovere’) care: and
which make the heart col-d and the feel-
ings dn-ll. Others apply it to similar
objects 3 but as the remedies by which care
is sought to be alleviated are “fomenta
vulnus nil malum levantia '' (Epod. xi. 17
3.), 1 incline to the latter myself. [Cicero
(Tuscul. ii. 24, quoted by Kriiger) has
‘haec sunt solatia, haec fomenta sum-
morum dolorum‚’ which may be applied
to this passage. Florus might be
a philosopher, if he would neglect ‘the
cold consolations for cares‚' that is, such
things, whatever they may be, which are in-
efi‘ectual and do not alleviato our troubles]

They are still ‘frigida,' in the sense above
given.

28. parvi properemus et ampli] As to
‘properemus‚' see Epp. 2. 61, 11., and with
the sentiment compare Epp. 1. 25, “Aeque
pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque.'’

30. si tibi cua-ae] Many of the MSS.
have ⁸ sit,' but ‘ si’ is better, and has suffi-
cient autbority. ‘Si' and ‘sit’ are con-
fused in the MSS. See Epod. i. 5 n.
Horace says, ‘You must write meback
word whether you make as much of Mun&
tius as he deserves, or whether your mutual
regar-d (which had been interrupted), like
a wound ill· sewn, refuses to unite and is
torn open again.' Munatius has been
mentioned before (C. i. 7, Introduction) as
the son of Munatius Plancus, the consul
of Amne. 712. We know nothing more
about him except that he was consul in
A.u.c. 766, and that he was afterwards
sent as one of the commissionem from the
senate to the mutinous German legions
(Tac. Ann. ·i. 39). It appears he and
Florus had quarrelled ς we are not told
what it was about ς but Horace attributes
it to youthful heat and ignorance of the
worldy He likens them to unbroke horses,

and' m terms more affectionate than gram- ,

matical tells them that they ought to
make it up, and that when they come
home they will find the fatted calf ready
for sacrifice. Compare C. i. 36, written
on the return of Numida. It is impossible
to put the different parts of the sentence
together so as to make the construction
regular and natural, but the sense is clear
enough. Horace fiequently uses ‘dignus’
