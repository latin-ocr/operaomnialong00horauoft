HORATII FLACCI SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 8.

Ridetur fictis rerum Balatrone secundo,
Nasidiene, redis mutatae frontis, ut arte

Emendaturus fortunam ς deinde secuti

'85

Mazonomo pueri magno discerpta ferentes
Membra gruis sparsi sale multo, non sine farre,
Pinguibus et ficis pastum jecur anseris albae
Et leporum avolsos, ut multo suavius, armos,

Quam si cum lumbis quis edit ;

tum pectore adusto 90

Vidimus et merulas poni et sine clune palumbes,
Suaves res, si non causas narraret earum et
Naturas dominus3 quem nos sic fugimus ulti
Ut nihil omnino gustaremus, velut illis

Canidia afflasset pejor serpentibus Afris.”

83. Rideturfictis rerum] They pretend
to be laughing at something else when
Nasidienus comesin. As to ‘fictis rerum,'
see C. iv. 12. 19 n. 3 and 4. 76. ‘Bala-
trone secundo‚’ Orelli sayS‚ is a metaphor
from a favourable wind, as if it meant that
Balatro helped the joke. This is not very
' satisfactory. Acron interprets it “ ex tristi
hilari facto‚'' which belongs more to ‘mu-
tatae frontis? Comm. Cruq. 1 think is
nearer the meaning when he renders it
“ hypocritam agente, subsequente, subser-
viente3 pocula etiam poscens secundabat
omnia jocis suis.'' He played δευτεραγω-
viarm who supported the principal actor,
but was not so prominent. (Epp. i. 18. 14.)
Balatro was a wit and sarcastic. He sup-
plied jokes and the others laughed. ‘ Ma-
zonomus’ was a large round dish, properly
one from which bread (μάζα) was distri-
buted. Cranes became a fashionable dish
with the Romans, but not till after this
time, when stoi-ks were preferred (S. 2. 50
n.). Thc liver of a white goose fattened

ou figs, the legs of a hare served up sepa-
rately, as being (according to the host),
better flavoured when dressed without the
loins, blackbirds burnt in roasting, and
wood-pigeons with the hindei· parts, which
were most sought after, removed, these
composed the last ‘ferculum’ brought in
as special delicacies to make up for the late
catastrophe. But the officiousness of the
host destroyed the relish of his dishes, aud
the guests had their revenge by tasting
nothing he put before. them, and presently
taking their leave.

[90. pectore adusto] Doederlein follow-
ing Schol. Cruq. contentis that ‘adusto'
means ‘ well roasted,' ‘ browned.’]

[— edit] Ritter supposes that this is
the indicative and not the subjunctive as
in Ep. iii. 3: but his reasons for this
opinion are not satisfactory]

95. Canidia afflasset] Here is this wo·
man again, the last time we meet with her.
See Ep. iii. 8 n.;> v. and xvii„ Introduc-
tion, and S. i. 8, Introduction.
