to ‘thia edition. Franke however denies that this ode has reference to. that voyage.
He even thinks it doubtful whether it is addreased toVirgil the poet3 and though he is
in general very acute and judiciem, his real for the theory he advocates ran away with
his judgment when it led him to think that Quintilius, whose death is lamented in C. 24
of this book, is the person here addressed, and that perhaps he was drowned on the
voyage, since it is clear, says he, from that ode that he met with an untimely and vio·
lent death. Coming from most other people this theory would not be worth mentioning.
'l'hat it is the resort of an advocate in difficulty is clear on the fiice of it. He thinks these
two odes are closely connected, though the link has been lost to us from the obscurity of
the allusione, but he finds a trace of it in the words “Navis quae tibi creditum Debes '’
(v. 6 ofthis ode), and c.24. 11, “'l'u frustra pius heu! non ita creditum? There is no
'eight in this argument at all 3 nevertheless, there is no certainty that the ode was
written on the occasion supposed. Virgil may have made or contemplated a voyage
before his last, and there is so much difficulty attending the date Amne. 735 that 1 am
inclined to think such must have been the case. 'l'his leaves the date of the ode in
uncoetainty. Franke’s best argument is, that if the publication of these odes took place
aster Virgil’s death, it must have been immediately or very soon aster, even according
to the chronology of Kirchner and others who are opposed to him; and that it would
lnve been in the worst taste and feeling to have inserted this ode at such a time. There
can be little doubt, 1 think, but he would have suppreased it, or acoompanied it with one
exprening his own and the universal sorrow. I cannot imagine a greater mockery than
the insertion of an ode addressed to Virgil on the death ofhis friend, and an ode praying
for his safe voyage, at a time when all Virgil's friends must have been bewailing his
‹le-th: to which no allusion is made in any part of Horace's writings. Thia last fact
would be accounted for ifwe supposed Virgil to have died during the time when Horace
had almost if not entirely suspended this kind of writing. Franke's attempt to show
that there was not that mutual affection between V‘ugil and Horace which would warrant
the expressions in this ode is very weak. But others have affirmed the same because
Virgil nowhere mentions Horace, and because he did not leave him his liter-ary executor,
hut chose Varius and Tucca rather than Horace. But Virgil lest his AEneid not to be
puhlished but destroyed, and there is no reason why he should have chosen Horace for
such a purpose. A man may have more friends than executors, and does not always give
that office to those he loves best. As for the other argument, if the nature of Virgil’s
poema be considered, it is not worth notieing.

compare with this ode Statius? ‘Propempticon ' to Metius Celer, ‘ a most noble and
ple-sant youth‚’ whom as he could not aecompany he sent upon his way with a beautiful
address, suggested partly it would seem by this of Horace (Silv. iii. 2).

ARGUMENT.

We commit to thee V‘ugil, Ο thou ship ς deliver him safe on the shores of Attica,
and preserve him whom 1 love as my life; and may the skies and winds proeper
thee. Hard and rash was the man who first tempted the sea and defied the winda.
In what shape should he sear the approach of death who unmoved could look on the
monster! of the deep and the swelling waves and dangerous- rocks? In vain
did God separate lands if man is to leap over the forbidden waters- So doth he ever
