Humno capiti cervicem pictor equinam

Jungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas

Undique collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum

Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne,

Spectatum admissi risum teneatis, amici? 5
Credite, Pisones, isti tabulae fore librum

Persimilem cujus, velut aegri somnia, vanae

Fingentur specim, ut nec pes nec caput uni

Pictoribus atque poetis

Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas. 10
Scimus· et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim 3

Sed non ut placidis coe'ant immitia, non ut

Serpentes avibus geminentur, *tigribus agni.

Inceptis gravibus plerumque et magna professis

Purpureus, late qui splendeat, unus et alter 15
Adsuitur pannus, cum lucus et ara. Dianae

Et properantis aquae per amoenos ambitus agros,

Aut flumen Rhenum aut pluvius describitur arcus 3

Sed nunc non erat his locus.

1. Humano capiti] The picture supposed
is monstrous enough; a woman's head and
8 fish's 1811, with ahorse’s neck, limbs
from all manner of beust& and feathers
from all sorts of birds. This portentous
medley (invented of course by himself, for
we are not bound to suppose he had ever
seen a pictorial monster of this kind),
Horace considered 8 good illustration of
some of the poetry of his day, in which

,figures and imag-es were thrown together

without order or purpose.

[9. Reddatur] ‘Referred to.’ ‘Gemi-
nentur' means the same ss ‘ coeant: ‘pain’
⁶ Plerumque: S. ii. 5. 55.]

- fictoribus atque poe'tis] This is a
supposed reply, that painters and poets
have always been privileged people‚ which
Horace admits, but within certain limite.

Et fortasse cupressum

should they patch their verses with images
which, however pretty, have nothing to do
with the matter in hand.

18. flumen Rhenum] This is the same
form 88 “Metaurum flumen” (C. iv. 4. 38).

[19. Sed nunc] He means, ‘these de·
scriptions are out of place ;' but he says
‘there was 110 place for them now‚’ meaning
probably at the time when they were used.

— fortasse cupressum scis simulare}
The Scholiasts all agree in saying this
refers to 8 Greek proverb, μή τι καὶ κυπα-
ρίσσου vehem the origin of which was an
answer given by a bad painter to 8 ship-
wrecked sailor, who asked him for 8 picture
of his wreck (see C. i. 5. 12 n.). The man
considered himself elever at drawing 8
