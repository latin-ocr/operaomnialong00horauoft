the jurisconsultus, who did not pursue his
laborious vocation for pay. He therefore
shifts or limits his ground a little, and
dwells upon that which he supposes to be
the most prevalent cause of discontent 3
and with his ground he changes his ex-
amples. There is no reason, therefore, to
suspect the reading ‘perfidus hic caupo‚’
which has caused the critics a vast deal of
- trouble ever since Markland first suggested
that it was wrong. Orelli has quoted nine
different conjectural readings, >not one of
which seems to me to have any merit. Fea

for ‘caupo‚' but that is not surprising.

‘N auta' aud ‘mercator' here are the same
person, the trader navigating his own ship.

appears again in ‘cauponibus atque malig- -

qui currunt' is repeated from C. i. 3. 9
sqq. [⁴0a11p0nes et stabularios eos acci-
pimus qui cauponam vel stabulum exercent
institoresve (their agents) eorum? The
‘ caupo' is 311 innkeeper; the ‘stabularius'
is a ‘stable-keeper’ ‘qui permittit jumenta
apud eum stabulari? Their liabilities to
those who lodged with them or eutrusted
their beasts to them were defined by rules
of law, which are the origin of our rules.
Dig. 4. tit. 9.]

32. cibaria] This word, which is gene-
rally used for the rations of soldiers or
slaves, is used here ironically for the hum-
blest provisiou that 0311 110 made for the
latter years of life, 33 11“ that was 311 that
these men set before their minds.

and instinct teaches her to provide against

and provides accordingly. This is what

Horace means; but the ant is torpid in
the winter, and lays up no store in her
house for that sea'son‚ though 00 error is
more common than to suppose that slie
does. These 30101313 work hard during the
warmer months of the year, but the food
they gather is consumed before the

enters Aquarius in the middle of J anuary.
Virgil uses the word ‘contristat’ (Georg.
iii. 279): “unde nigerrimus Auster Nas-
citur, et pluvio contristat frigore caelum.”
The MSS. are divided between ‘sapiens’
and ‘patiens' Τ110 Scholiasts too are di·
vided. Acron had ‘patiens,’ and inter-
preted it ‘contenta' while Porphyriou's
reading, 3011 that of Cruquius’ Commen-
tator, was ‘ sapiens? 'l'he editions before
Lambinus 1 believe, with scarcely any ex-
ceptions, 113νο ’03110033 He restored
‘ sapiens‚' which Cruquius found in all his
MSS„ 31111 1 have no doubt it is the right
word. It suits the context, and corre-
sponds to what Horace says elsewhere (C.
iv. 9. 45) :—

“ deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti.”

The question at issue is not one of patience,
but of prudenee in the pursuit and the use
of wealth, both of which, according to the
vulgar error, the ant is famous for. She is
one of the “four things which are little
upon the earth, but they are exoeeding
wise”—the ants, the eonies,¹ the locusts,
and the spiders. (Prov. xxx. 24 sqq.)
