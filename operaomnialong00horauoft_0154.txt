118 HORATII FLACCI

Non, si trecenis, quotquot eunt dies,
Amice, places illacrumabilem

Compescit -unda, scilicet omnibus
Quicunque terrae munere vescimur,
Enaviganda sive reges
Sive inopes erimus coloni.
Frustra cruento Marte carebimus
Fractisque rauci fluctibus Hadriae,
Frustra per auctumnos nocentem
Corporibus metuemus Austrum :

6. illacrumabilem] Here, this word is
used in an active sense. ‘It istused pas-
sively in C. iv. 9. 26: “ Omnes illacruma-
biles urgentur.'' See note on C. i. 3. 22.
It corresponds with Homer's Ἀΐδης ἀμείῖ
λιχος ἠδ’ ἀδάμαστος (11. ix. 158), where
ἀδάμαστος is expressed by ‘indomitae' (4).
Compare Aristophanes (Ran. 1392), μόνος
θεῶν γὰρ θάνατος οὺ δώρων ἐρᾷ, and Ho-
race’s “Orcus—non exorabilis auro’' (Epp.
ii. 2. 178). [In order to avoid the ridi-
culous hyperbol& as Ritter calls it, ex-
pressed by ‘trecenis tauris‚' he mistrans-
lates the passage thus, ‘⁴ three hundred
bulls yearly, or as many as there are days
in the year ;'' and he makes it still worse
by his explanation. Three hundred bulls
a day is no more ridiculous hyperbola thfln.
three hundred bulls, or three hundred. and
sixty—five bulls a ycan] ''

7. ter amplum] ‘ Ter' expresses the
triple form of the giant. “ Quidve tripec-
tora tergemini vis Geryonai· '' (Lucret. v.
28). [‘ Ter amplum' represents the τρι-
σώματος of EHPPidQ Herc. furens, 423.
Ritter. ⁴

8. igi-sti compescit unda] This is Vir-
gil’s description (Aen. ‘'i-⁷438) :—
tristique palus inamabilis unda
Alligat et novies Styx interfusa coercet,”

which is repeated from Georg. iv. 479.
Sophocles (Electra, 137) calls it πάγκοινον
λίμναν.

10. Quicunque terrae ¹munere vescimur]
This expresses the words of Homer, ὃς
θνητός τ’ εἴη καὶ ἔδοι Δημήτερος ἀκτήν
(ΙΙ. xiii. 322), οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν ἔδουσι

(ΙΙ. vi. 142), which last Simonides has
closely imitated in the fragment preserved
in Plato'sProtagoras (8 Bergk).

11. reyes] Horace's usual word for the
rich (C. i. 4. 14). ‘ Colonus’ was the lessee
of a farm, the owner of which was called
‘ dominus ' in respect to that· property.
‘Reges’ therefore. here are ‘domin1.' A
‘ colonus ’ might be rich and the tenant of
a large farm ς but ,Horace refers to the
poorer soi-,t here and in C. i. 35. 6. See
Cic. in· Verr.¹ ii. 3, 5, 22 3 Long’s notes.
Horace uses ‘inops ’ sometimes in an ex-
treme, sometimes in a¹ qualifled sense of
want, but more generally the latter, as he
does ‘pauper’ C. i. ¹1. 18 n. 'I'he opposi-
tion¹ is between high, and low, and the dif-
ferencenis one of position, as in the third
odebofl-this book (v. ΖΞ sqq.). “ The small
and great are there, and the servant is free
from his master '’ (J ob iii. 19). This seems
to express the meaning.

15. Frustra per auctummoe nocentem]
There is a like passageiin S. ii. 6. 18 ε

“N ec mala me ambitio perdit nec plum·
bens Auster
Auctumnusquegravis Libitinae quaestus
acerbae.''
Dillenbr. says ‘corporibus’ may be go·
verned by ‘nocentem ' or ‘metue-mus? It
can only be governed by ‘ nocentem!
Horace would not put that participle ab·
solutely for ‘noxium,' especially with a
dative immediately following and depend-
ing on another word.
19. damnatusque lonyi] This follows
the Greek construction, καταγνωσθεὶς πό·
