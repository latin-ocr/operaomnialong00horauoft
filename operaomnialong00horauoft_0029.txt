coast of Italy. When this happened nobody knows. After the publica-
tion of the three books of Odes, Horace seems to have ceased from that
style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other compositions we know
of his having produced in the next few years are metrical Epistles to
different friends, of which he published a volume probably in aare. 734
or 735. He seems to have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-
phical writers, and to have got a good deal interested in them, and also
to have become a little tired of the world and disgusted with the
jealousies his reputation created. His health did not improve as he got
older, and he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em-
peror’s new physician ⁸. By his advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary to be a good deal away
from Rome, especially in the autumn and winter⁴.

In A.U.c. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Saeculares, and Horace
was required to write an Ode for the occasion, which he did, and it has
been preserved. This circumstance, and the credit it brought him, may
have given his mind another leaning to Ode-writing, and have helped
him to produce the fourth book, a few pieces in which may have been
written at any tim& It is said that Augustus particularly desired
Horace to publish another book of Odes, in order that those he wrote
upon the victories of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in
it. The latter of these Odes was not written, 1 believe, till A.U.c. 741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The Odes of the
fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the first three books that surpass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of Drusus, and few superior to that which is addressed to
Lollius. ΤΙιθ success of the first three books, and the honour of being
chosen to compose the Ode at the Ludi Saeculares, seem to have given
him encouragement. There are no incidents in his life during the above
period recorded or alluded to in his poems. He lived five years after
the publication of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
and during that time I think it probable he wrote the Epistles to Au-
gustus and Florus which form the second book; and having conceived
the intention of writing a poem on the art and progress of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which has
been preserved among his works. The fiagments of which that poem
appears to be composcd, and which some have vainly tried to reduce to
a consistent whole, may have been written earlier than 1 have supposed3
but there is so much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epistle
to Augustus that Ι believe they were written at no great interval of
