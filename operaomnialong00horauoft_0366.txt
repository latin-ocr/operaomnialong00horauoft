HORATII FLACCI

Naturae fines viventi jugera. centum an 50
Mille aret? “ At suave est ex magno tollere acervo.'’

Dum ex parvo nobis tantundem haurire relinquas,

Cur tua plus laudes cumeris granaria nostris?

Ut tibi si sit opus liquidi non amplius urna,

Vel cyatho, et dicas, “ Magno de flumine malim 55
Quam ex hoc fonticulo tantundem sumere. '’ Eo fit

Plenior ut si quos delectet copia justo

Cum ripa simul avulsos ferat Aufidus acer.

At qui tantuli eget quanto est opus is neque limo

Turbatam haurit aquam neque vitam amittit in undis. 60
At bona pars hominum decepta cupidine falso,

nature become confused with the wants of
fashion‚ he would find it hard to do so ς 13

31111 the fault lies in a great degree, though
not entirely, with the social laws or habits
which create that difficulty. The ease
supposed is that of 3 111311 who professes to
wish to live reasonably, and has greater
wealth than a reasonable mode of life re-

· quires, What velue, Horace asks, has the
surplus for the owner? The answer (in-
troduced as usual by ‘at ’) sounds irra-
tional, and even εχει-3113831111, but it is the
only solution of avarice in its simple
form.

[50. centum an mille] This isone of the
forms of expressing an alternative, which
is expressed at length by ‘ utrum an‚' and

ng'z’ilncvjclmeris] Acron explains ‘cumerae’
as large baskets of wicker-work or earthen-
ware vessels like a ‘dolium‚' inwhich fax-mers
kept their wheat. He says that ‘ cumerae’
were also vessels of smaller capacity con-
taining five or six ‘modii‚’ called in the
Sabine language ‘ trimodiae. ’

54. l zquidi] This word' 13 used for‘ aqua’
by Ovid (Met. v. 454). “Cum liquido
mixta perfundit diva polenta.” Tbe‘ urna,’
one of the Roman liquid mea-sures, con-
tained half an ‘amphorass or twenty· f-our

‘sextat-ii? The ‘cy athus’ contained one-
twelfth of a ‘sextaryius (C. iii. 19. 14 n..)
[‘ Non amplius? ‘a pitcher of water, not
more. ' This form occurs in Caesar: B. Gr.
i. 41, ‘milium amplius quinquaginta cir-
cuitu? ‘Amplius' in such cases is inde·
pendent of the grammatical construction. ]

55. malian] All the editions before
Bentley had‘ mallem‚’ which he changed

‘malimss not without MS. authority.
Fea, Cunningham, Sanadon, Meineke, and
others have the present. ‘Malim' simply
means ‘I would rather ,·’ ‘mallem,' Ἰ

would have done it if I could, but the time
past? Heindorf defends ‘ malim? The
‘ violens Aufidus ’ (C. iii. 30. 10) repre-
sents the copious stream, because it is
Horace's purpose to represent a river rapid
as well as broad. Swinburne (⁸ Travels in
the two Sicilie& vol. i. p. 165) says of this
river, which he visited in the summer of
1778, “ there was but little water in it, and
that whitish and muddy 3 but from the
wideness of its bed, the sandbanks and but-
tresses erected to break the force of the
stream, it is plain that it still answers to
Horace's epithets of fieree, mering, and
violent.” See C. iv. 14. 25 n. [Orelli and
Ritter have ‘ mallem? Ritter has the fol-
lowing note: ‘mallem’ si fieri : at fieri
nunc non potest, quippe ad fonticulum est,
ut ostendunt verba ‘ ex hoc fonticulo‚’
non in fluminis ripa. Recte igitur se habet
“mallem ” non “ malim.” He seems to
{flgffiss'iai {ffigssivsssfflssat 33331ᾶέ
a. river which is ‘ um’ or full. This
is ingenious, but perhaps not the true
explanation.]

59. tantuli eget quanto est opus] From
some unknown MSS. which Lambinus says
have ‘ quantum,’ Bentley adopts that read-
ing. All the editions before him and all
other MSS. have ‘.quanto ' The nominative

‘'quantum 13 admissibla as Bentley has
shown (see also Key' s L. Gr. ξ 999 note),
and if the weight and existence of Lambi-
11113’3 MSS. were more certain, there would
be something' m Bentley' s argument (the
common one) that the copyists were more
likely to change ‘ quantum ’ into ‘quanto’
than, viee versa, the ablative into the no-
minative.

61. bona φωνῇ’ ‘Bona pars. major ’'
(Acron). ‘B‘ona nunc pro dictum,
ut saepe Ennius et alii veteres” (Pol-ph..)
