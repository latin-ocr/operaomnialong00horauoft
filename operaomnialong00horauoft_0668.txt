HORATII FLACCI

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia solis,

Nec vixit male qui natus moriensque fefellit.
Si prodesse tuis pauloque benignius ipsum

Te tractare voles, accedes siccus ad unctum.
“ Si pranderet olus patienter regibus uti
Nollet Aristippus.” “ Si sciret regibus uti

Fastidiret olus qui me notat.”

recommends his friend to go there, if the
object of his wishes is a quiet life, which he
says is not without its recommendations.
[Ritter says, the small Etrurian town was
the place which Horace alludes to.]

10. moriensque fefellit] Horace uses
‘ fallere' as the Greeks used λανθάνειν (C.
iii. 16. 32 n.). But it is only used abso-
lutely here and in the next Epistle (v. 103),
‘ secretum iter ct fallentis semita vitae!
- Livy uses it without a substantive after
it (xxii. 33) t “ speculator Carthaginiensis
qui per biennium fefellerat Romae depre-
hensus? Horace takes his expression from
the Greek proverb λάθε βιώσας, which ap-
pears to have been used by the Epicureans
and Cyrenaics. Plutarch opposes the rule
in a treatise of which the title is εἷ καλῶς
εἴρηται τὺ λάθε βιώσας. Erasmus quotes
Ovid (Trist. iii. 4. 25) :—

“ Crede mihi bene qui latuit, bene vixit, et
intra
Fortunam debet quisquemanere suam.'’

12. siccus ad unctum] Comm. Cruq. ex-
plains thus: “ pauper et tenuis ad opulen-
tum et locupletem.'' So Forcellini explains
‘siccus‚' but he does not give any other
examples of this sense. There is an ex-
pression in Theocritus which is obscure,
but bears some likeness to this (Id. 1. 51),
where a fox is represented as having a (le-
sign upon a boy's breakfast :—

ἆ δ’ ἐπὶ πήραν
πάντα δόλον τεύχοισα τὸ παιδίον οὐ πρὶν
ἆνὴσειν
(pari, πρὶν ἢ ’νάριστον ἐπὶ ξηροΐσι καθ-
ίξῃ 2

which means that the fox is resolved not to
go away till he has left the boy without his
breakfast; and ἐπὶ ξηροῖσι, ‘ on dry meat,'
means no meat at all. So ‘ siccus ' means
one who cannot command a ‹linuer, or can

only command a dry one. The Cynics were
called ξηρόφαγοι srom their abstinence, and
ξηροφαγία among the early Christianis was
a. fast.

13. Si pranderet ola-s· patienter] Dio-
genes Laert. (ii. 68) relates that Aristippus
one day was passing Diogenes, the Cyme,
while he was washing some vegetables for
his dinner‚ and he was accosted thus: εἰ
ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἂν τυράν-
νων αὐλὰς ἐθεράπευες, alluding· to his hav-
ing becn the guest of the younger Diony-
sius of Syracuse. The answer of Aristip-
pus was: καὶ σύ, εἴπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθρώποις
ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν λάχανα ἔπλυνες.

15. qui me notat] ‘ Notare' is used in a
bad sense (S, i. 6. 20 n.).

18. Μονάασε-ννι Cynicum] The character
of Diogenes is proverbial, and the stoi-ies
that are told of him are too well known to
require repetition. He was like his master
Antisthenes in character, and adopted his
views with a zeal that knew no discre-
tion z so that the popular notion ofa Cynic
is derived, as in other cases, rather from
the disciple than the founder of the school,
whose contempt for sensual pleasures, and
stern opposi tion to the sels-indulgent spirit
of his age, and especially of the Cyrenaic
school (whatever defects of judgment he
may have shown), place him very high in
the history of Greek philosophy. · The
Cynics received their name from the place
where Antisthenes taught, the Cynosarges,
a gymnasium at Athens.

19. Seurror eqo ipse milti] This verb
does not occur elsewhere. The parti-
ciple is used in the next Epistle (v. 2).
Aristippus is· supposed to parry the blow
(‘ eludere‚’ a metaphor taken from the
gladiators) of Diogenes thus, by ad-
mitting, for the sake of argument, that
he acted parasite to a king3 yet it was
for his own advantage ς whereas the Cynic
