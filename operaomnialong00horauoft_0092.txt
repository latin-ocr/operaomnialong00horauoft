» HORATII FLACCI

Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor 5
Urget! cui Pudor et J ustitiae soror
Incorrupta Fides nudaque Veritas
Quando ullum inveniet parem ⁴?
Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,

Nulli flebilior quam tibi, Virgili.

10

Tu frustra pius heu non ita creditum
Poscis Quintilium deos.

Quodsi Threicio blandius Orpheo
Auditam moderere arboribus fidem,

Non vanae redeat sanguis imagini,

15

Quam virga semel horrida
Non lenis precibus fata recludere
Nigro compulerit Mercurius gregi.
Durum : sed levius fit patientia

Quidquid corrigere est nefas.

“ 3. Melpomene] See C. i. 12. 2n.

6. Pudor et Justitiae soror—Fides]
F xgures of these personages occur on coins
with various descriptive accompaniments.
They are associated C. S. 57. Cicero
(de Off. i. 7) : “ Fundamentum autem jus-
titiae est fide& id est dictorum convento-
rumque constantia et veritas.''

8. inveniet] Most of the older editions
have ‘invenient 3' but nearly all the MSS.
appear to have ‘ inveniet,’ and Bentley has
shown, by a large number of inmunes, that
it is Horace’s practice to have the verb in
the singular number aster several substan-
tives as here. He says that it is never
otherwise except in corrupt passages,
which' is his way of begging the question.
In C. iii. 16. '7 all the MSS. have‘ risis-
ient?

11. Du frustra pius heu non ita cre-
ditum] ‘ It is vain, alas! that with picus
prayers thou dost ask the gods to restore
Quintilius, whom thou didst entrust to
their keeping, but not 011 these terms' (i.e.
that they should take him away). Such is
Porphyrion’s explanation. Lambinus and
Graevius understood ‘ non ita creditum’ to
mean that he was not entrusted to Virgil
on such terms that he was never to part
with him. 1 prefer the first.

13. Quodsi] All the Berne MSS„ and
Cruquiusss and some others, have‘ quid si,'
which some editors adopt, with the usual
note of interrogation after ‘ quid? But
‘ quodsi’ is supported by good authority,

20

and most of the editors have adopted it. Ι
have no doubt it is right. Horace never
uses ‘sin‚ ’which Virgil uses as osten and m
the same way as Horace uses ‘quodsi’
[Keller and Ritter have‘ ‘Quid si--fidem‚
Num vanae, &c.' ’]

15. imagini] ‘ 'was that unsub-
stantial body' 111 which the soul was sup
posed to dwell aster death, called by the
Greeks εἴδωλον. Such were the forms that
Aeneas saw and thought them substan-

“Et ni docta comes tenues sine corpore

vitas

Admoneat volitare cava sub imagine

formae,

Irruat et frustra ferro diverberet umbras?

Aen. vi. 292 sqq.

17. Non lenis precibus fata recludere]
See 1.18 note. ‘Fata recludere’ seems to
mean ‘to open the door of hell when Fato
has closed it?

18. Νιξᾳνο comulerit—yreyt] ‘ 1111838-
thered to the dark crowd? The dative is
only admissible in poetry. S. ii. 5. 49:
‘⁴ Si quis casus puerum egerit Orco,’ for
‘ ad Orcum?

19. Durum .· ced levius] Donatus says
that Vix-gil was much in the habit of com-
mending this virtue of patience, saying that
the hardest fortnnes might be overcome by
a wise endurance of them. Therefore, says
Fabricius, Horace consoles virgil with 1118
own philosophy.
