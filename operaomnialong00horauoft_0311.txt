explains ‘altirivi’ *obe ’θαμὰ brooks
which therefore make little or no noise. ']
Bentley contradicts his own theory hy
advooeting‘ripis’ (C. iii. 25.13 ιι.).
‘Altis ripis’ are rocky overhanging banks,
not, as Bentley and Gesner say ,banks ren-
dered high by the subsiding of the stream
iu summer, ιιι which there is no poetry.

‘Obstrepunt ' is used absolutely, as C. iii.
30. 10. Some (thinking a dative case re·
quired after ‘obstrepunt ’) understand ‘illi,’
some ‘avibus‚’ aud Markland prefers to
ehange‘ fontes’ into ‘frondes' and make
‘l ymphis’ the dative case, as in Propert-
(iv. 4. 4): “Multaque nativis obstrepit
arbor aquis. ” ‘Lymphis ' is what is called
the ablative absolute. [It was suggested
tomeby T. F. Ellisthat Horacehas' imi-
tated a fragment of Sappho:—

-ἆμφὶ δ’ ὕδωρ
ψῧχρον κελαδεῖ δι’ ὔσδων
μαλίνων, αἶθυσσομένυν δὲ φύλλων
κῶμα καταρῥεΐτ
ιιιιᾱ if this is so, it is further supposed
that it confirms Markland' s ‘.fi·ondes ⁹]

26. Queruntur] Virg- (Ecl. i. 56):

“Saepe levi somnum suadebit inire su-

in Virgil (Ecl. iii. 57), “formosissimus
annuS.'’

31. Aut trudit acres] There is a de-
scription in a simile of Statius (Achill. i.
459 sqq.) of this way of hunting wild
beasts.'1'he hunters encom some
large space (generally the foot of a woozled
hill) with strong nem, which they gra-
dually drew into a more and more narrow
circle, while dogs and beaters with torehes
