effect. Τὴθ melting of the incense was
apparently shown to the party, who saw
the fact, but they would not believe the
miracle, and made no further inquiry.]
100. Judaeus Apella] The majority of
the Jews at Rome were freedmen, which
probably affords the best explanation of
the synagogue of the Libertines at J emsa-
lem mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles
(vi. 9). Apella was a common name for
‘ libertini: Their creed was a superstition
of the most contemptible kind in the eyes
of a Roman ; and a J ew was only another ,
name for a credulous fool. The Jews re-
turned the contempt with hatred‚ which
vshowed itself in a turbulent spirit that
made them very troublesome. Horace
intimates that he had learnt from the
school of Epicurus that the gods were too
happy to look aster the small affairs of
this world, which he expresses in the
words of Lucretius (vi 58): “Nam bene
qui didicere deos securum agere aevum'’
(C. i. 34. 2 n..) [‘ Tristes,' in ‘their
anger’ perhaps is the meaning; unless
Kriiger is right when he explains it to
mean the serious concern of the gods about

human affairs. ]

104. Brundusium] From this abrupt
conclusion we may judge that Horace was
tired of his journal as well as his journey.
Brundusium (Brindisi) was for centuries
the most important town on the eastern
coast of Italy, chiefly through the con-
venience of the position for communi·
cating with Greece, and the excellence of
the harbour. The port is double. The
outer port is formed by two promontories

that stretch off gradually from each other
as they advance into the sea, leaving a
very narrow channel at the base of the
angle, which leads into the inner port.
This stretches to the right and lest, and
between the two arms or branehes lay the
city. In the old Messapian tongue Brun·
dusium is said to have meant a deer, the
name being derived from the appearance
of a stag’s head formed by this inner port.

“The whole kingdom of Naples cannot
show a more complete situation for trade
than Brindisi. Here goodness of soil, safety
of anchorage, and a central position are
au united'’ (Swinb. i. 386). [The port
is now used again. The railvmy of North
Italy is extended fn Brundusium, and
steamers sail from the port to Alexandria]
Little remains of ancient Brundusium ex-
cept broken pinara, ente of common
Mosaic, with a few inscriptions and coins.
The distance from Egnatia was thirty-
five miles according to the Jerusalem
Itinerary and the Tabula Theodosiana,
and thirty-eight according to the Itinerary
of Antoninus. There was a station Ad
Turres between Barium and Egnatia, and
a station Speluncae (Grotta Rossa), about
midway between Egnatia and Brundusium,
at one or both of which Horace may have
halted a night, but which, having nothing
he cared to tell us about them, he has
passed over in silence. [If Horace stayed
all night only at the places which he has
mentioned, he arrived at Brundusium on
the fifteenth day aster leaving Rome.
