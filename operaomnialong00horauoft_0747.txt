“ Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.''
Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu ¹?
Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte:

“ Dic mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Trojae
Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et ur .”

Non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem
Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin.

Nec reditum Diomedis ab interitu Meleagri,

different subjects, among others the story
of Philoctetes told in Sophocles' play. See
Aristotle (Post. 23), where also reference
is made to another Cyclic poem called
Κύπρια, from the birth-place of the author
Stasinm, which was intended 88 an intro-
duction to the Iliad of Homer, and em-
braced the birth of Helen the daughter of
Zeu· aad Nemesis (not Leda), the judg-
nient of Paris, the abduction of Helen, the
nmisios of Iphigenia, and the events of the
first nine years of the war. Of the other
poem one was the Νόστοι by Agias of
Troezen, on the return of the Grec-ian com-
mandere from Troy, the wanderiugs of

Henetus, the murder of Agamemnon, and>

the revenge of Orestes. Another was the
Τηλεγονία of Eugammon of Cyrene, which
continued the history of Ulysses tili his
death by the hand of his son Telegonus.

γ Τ118 Τ11811818 and Epigoni, relating the con-

testu between Argos and Thebes, are. also
included in the Cyclic poenis, but their
‚authors are unknown. (See for more par·
timim-s Mffller’s Hist. of Gr. Lit. c. 6.)
There was 8 later Dpicpoem called Thebais,
the nuthm· of which was Antimachus of
clama, a contemporary of Plato. Porphy-
rion (on v. 146) mlls him a

Cyclic poet,
from the subject of his

poem, the extent of
which was such, he says, that he had filled
twenty-four volumes (that is, twenty-four
books) before the armament arrived at
Thebes (see note on the above verse). The
poem notwithstanding seems to have been
much admired.

139. Parim-iant montes] The reading
of the old editions and many MSS„ ‘-par
tur-ient? is undoubtedly wrong. Verbs
ending· m‘ urio ’siguify purpose or desire,
and‘ 'o’ has the same relation ω

‘pario '‘that esurio’ has to ‘'ed0, mean-
mgthe effert or desire to bring forth, the
being in labour. Porphyrion gquotes the
proverb on which this and the fable that
Phaedrushas imitated (iv. 22) of the moun-

tain in labour, are founded: ὤδινεν οὖρος
εἷτα μῦν &remens-r, which in Athenaeus
(xiv. 6) is quotedalittle differently: ὤδινεν
ὄρος, Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο, τὸ δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν.

143. Non fimum ez· fulgore] Horace
ffiszfffissffzffi? 2133? 3353:ssssssss
out of smoke comes a bright light; that is,
out of a modest beginning the reader is lcd
on to beauties and objects of inteream and
he is carried rapidly forward instead of
being detained over matters preliminary
and irrelevant. It is obvious that ‘ fumo ’
in the second clause is out of place, and is
only used to maintain a vex-bal antithesis ;
and the boeuties selected (‘ speciosa mira-
eula,' ‘ striking marvels ’) are not the most
striking. Horace seems always to fall short
of his subject when he speaks of Homer.

145. Antiphaten Scyllamque] These
stories are from the Odyssey. Antiphates
was king of the Laestrygones„ a gigantic
race in Sicily, who devoured three of Ulys-
ses’ companions and destroyed his ships (x.
80 sqq). The adventure with Polyphemus
the Cyclops forms the leading event of the

and Ch3rybdis' is in the twelsth book (vv.

146. Nec reditum Diomedis] This was
related in the Cyclic poem mlled Νόστοι
above mentioned. Mel r, who was one
of the Argonauts, and was still more famous
sor the destruction of the boar sent by
Diana to vex the inhabitants of Calydon m
Aetolia, was uncle to Diomedes, being bro-
