650 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE XX.

With this composition addressed to his book (which can hardly be any other than this
collection of Epistles) Horace sends it forth to take its chance in the world. He 811-
dresses it as a young and wauton maiden eager to escape from the retirement of her
home and to rush into dangers she knows nothing of. He tells her it will be too late to
repair her error when she discovers it 3 that she will be caressed for 8 time and then
thrown away, and, when her youth, and the freshness of her beauty are gone, she will
end her days in miserable drudgery and obscurity. He concludes with a description of
himself, his person, his character, and his age. It is assumed with much confidence by
Franke, that the Epistle was written 011 Horace’s birth-day, 8th December, ΔΑΜ). ¹734,
the year after that referred to at the end. 1 cannot discover on what grounds he rests
that opinion, or why Horace writing on his forty-fifth birth-day should 1811 the world
he was forty-four the year before. (See note on v. 28.) Η8 was more likely to do so
on any other day than that. [Ritter concludes that this Epistle was not written before
A.U.c. 736, because it is intended to accompany the first book of epistles‚ which he was
publishing, and because Epistles 13 and 19 were also written, as he says, in ΛΑΜ). 736.
He attempts to explain why Horace says that 110 was four and forty in the consulship
of Lollius, but his explanation is not satisfactory. It seems certain that there was only
one Μ. Lollius, to whom Horace has addressed two of these epistles, and if the poet
wished to tell his age, he could not do itin 8 more complimentary way to Lollius, than by
saying what his age was in the consulship of Lollius. No conclusion as to the time
when this epistle was written can be derived from that date, except that it was written

after A.u.e. 733] ARGUMENT

My foolish book, thou art casting glauces at the stalls 3 thou hatest the safeguards that
should keep thee chaste, 81111 wouldst flaunt in the public eye. Well, go whither thou
wilt ; but return there is none. ‘ Ah! what have I done θ’ thou wilt cry when th'ey
shall hart thee, and thy lovers shall be weary and cast thee aside- If Ι 8111 a true
prophet thou shalt be loved while youth is thine, but when thou art old and worn
they shall leave thee to decay, or send thee into exile far away. Then shall 1 laugh
at thee as the man who thrust his obstinate beast upon the rocks 3 for who can sava
him that is resolved to perish P And thy toothless age shall come to teach the ele-
ments to babes. Or if ever the neon-day heat shall have brought thee listeners, thou
wilt tell how I stretched my wings for a bolder ssight, and won the applause of the
great in the city and in the field 3 I, the humbly born, of mean aspect, grey before

my time, fit only for sunny elimes, of hasty spirit, but ever ready to forgive. And if

perchance they ask the number of my days, thou wilt say that forty winters and four
1 did accomplish in that year when Lollius got to himself Lepidus for his eolleaguo.
