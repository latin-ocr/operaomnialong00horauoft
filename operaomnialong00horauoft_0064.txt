28 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN IX.

This is a drinking—song for the winter,'imitated from an ode of Alcaeus, of which the
following fragment has been preserved in Athenaeus (34 Bergk) :
ῧει μὲν ὁ Ζεὺς, ἐκ δ’ ὀρανῶ μέγας

χείμων, πεπάγασιν δ’ ὑδάτων ῥόαι
t a: ι ῡ

κάββαλλε τὸν χείμωιΐ ἐπὶ μὲν τιθεὶς
πῦρ, ἐν δὲ κίρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως
μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ
μάλθακον ἆμφιτίθη γνόφαλλον.

Though the obvious fact that this ode is a close imitation of a Greek writer might
well lead us to believe that it is a mere work of art, some of the chronologists have found
it a date, each according to his own views. Dillenburger thinks it was written soon aster
the battle of Philippi, when Horace's friends were apt to dwell on unpleasant topica, and
required to have their spirits kept up. ,Iani supposes it was written at the country-
house of one Thaharchus, not far from Mount Soracte. Buttmann, too, thinks this is a.
proper name (though of course fictitious), in which 1 see uo reason to agree with him.

ARGUMENT.

See Soracte stands out with snow, the woods are bending with their burthen, and the
sharp frost hath frozen the streams. Heap logs on the fire, and draw your best
Sabine wine, feast-master, and leave the rest to the goda at whose bidding the fierce
winds are still and the woods have rest. Ask not what is to come: enjoy the present
ἀει-,ῃ let the (lance be ours while we are young, the Campus Martius, the promenade,
the nightly assignation, and the ooy girl that loves to be caught.

Argument. ‘ Stant lumina flamma’ (Aen.
vi. 300) might perhaps be rendered in the
same way, and “ Stant et juniperi et cas-
taneae hirsutae” (Virg. Eel. vii. 53), “J am
pulvere caelum stare vident '' (Aen. xii.
407), have something of the same meaning.
Soracte was one of the Faliscan range of
hius. about 2200 feet high, and 24 miles
from Rome. It is now called Monte San
Oreste. There is a miserable village of that
name at the s.r:. end of the range (West-

“Ut sumus in Ponto ter frigore constitit

trabile frigus' ofVirgil. But Horace also
applies it to heat (Epp. i. 10. 17): “ Cum
