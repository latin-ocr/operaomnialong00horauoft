236 HORATII FLACCI

command. 1 do not know why one should go into this and such-like minute points
except as it helps us to trace the progress of Horace’s mind and style, which it is
plain went through a great change aster the publication of the three first books of the
odes. Ι very much doubt whether he could have copied himself so exactly as he has
done in these two odes if any great interval had elapsed between them. 1 therefore am
inclined to set down this among Horace's earlier odes which he brought out of his desk
for the purpose above mentioned. But others will have their own opinion, and I am
not wedded to mine. It will at any rate be observed that the introduction of Tor-
quatus' name or the omission of it would be equally immaterial to the character and
scope of the ode, and that what has been said of other odes, and among them that
above referred to, is equally applicable to this, namely, that the name of a friend is
only introduced to give life and individuality to the poem.

ARGUMENT.

The winter is gone and the spring is returning with its green leaves, its gentler
streams, and its Graces. The seasons change and remind us of our end: but the
revolving year repairs its losses, while we go to the dust for ever, and we know not
when it will be. What thou dost enjoy thyself is so much taken from thy greedy
heir. When thou art dead, Torquatus, thy family, thine eloquence, and thy piety
will not restore thee to life any more than the love of DIana could bring back
Hippolytus or the friendship of Theseus Peirithous.

DIFFUGERE nives, redeunt jam gramina campis
Arboribusque comae3

Mutat terra vices et decrescentia ripas
Flumina praetereunt ;

Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet 5
Ducere nuda choros.

Immortalia ne speres monet annus et almum
Quae rapit hora diem.

Frigora mitescunt Zephyris, ver proterit aestas
Interitura simul

Pomifer Auctumnus fruges effuderit, et mox
Bruma recurrit mers.

Damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae· ε
Νο8 ubi decidimus

Quo pius Aeneas quo dives Tullus et Ancus
Pulvis et umbra sumus.

3. Mutat—vices] This is no more
than ‘subit vices.’ ‘Vices’ is what is
termed a cognate accusative. I do not
know why Forcell. should have supposed
‘decrescentia’ meant ‘valde crescentia·'
1 find the same interpretation in a note
in Bond’s variorum edition, but whose
it is does not appear. The meaning is
perfectly clean—that the streams lately
swollen by the winter rains or by the

first melting of the snow, had subsided
and no longer overflowed their banks but
flowed quietly between them. See C. iv.
