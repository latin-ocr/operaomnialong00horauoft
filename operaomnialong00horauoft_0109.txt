CARMEN XXXIV.

If Horace had any serious meaning in this ode, as 1 think he had, it is to be supposed
ha wrote it under some impulse of conscience, which told him that he had been too care-
less of that sovereign power which governs all things. ΤΙιε language, though impulsive,
appears genuine; and whether it was through the phenomenon here mentioned or any
other cause that his mind was impressed, he seems to express more than merely poetical
feeling ; and the power acknowledged is not that conventional Fortune of the next ode,
but the Supreme Being who declares his existence by the voice of conscience, through
sudden impressions and startling signs, such as under some form or other we may believe
Horace was struck with.

Ι believe Baxter was the first from the word ⁶ apieem ' (v. 14) to suppose an allusion
to the Parthians and the transfer of the power from Phraates to Tiridates, or back from
Tiridates to Phraates. This opinion is generally adopted now, and Buttmann hasgiven
it his sanction. He says “ apex is the peculiar name for the head-dress of tha Persian
kings ς and, just about the time when by the most probable calculation the odesof this
book must havebeen written, a revolution took place in the Parthian empire, the most
powerful state in the world next to Rome, whereby Tiridates was dethroned and driven
out of the country, and Phraates was re-established in his steadss’ More weight 1 think
is given to these words than they deserve. Chronologieally considered they must be
