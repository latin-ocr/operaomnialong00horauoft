Et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum

Et juvenum curas et libera vina referre.

Discriptas servare vices operumque colores
Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque pocta salutor ⁴?
Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo?

Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult3

Indignatur item privatis ac prope socco

Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum tenea-nt sortita decenter.
Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit,
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore;

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri

forming the heptachord. Though the flute
(⁴tibia') came very early into nse as an
accompaniment to lyric poetry, it has
always retained the name it originally de·
rived from the lyre. Τ1ιε description of
Horace includes the choi-al lyric of the
Dorie school, and the poetry of the Aeolio
whool. The former was adapted to a choir,
the latter only to a single voice. The

‚former was so called because it was culti·

vated by the Dorians of the Peloponnesus -

and Sicily z the latter flourished among
the Aeoli-ns of Asia Minor, aud particu-
larly in the island of Lesbos. The one
celebrated gods and heroes or renowned
citizam. md was used at public festivals
⁷ ,οι- at marriages and fanen-als: the other
exproesed individual thoughts and feelings
Almam and Sappho are the chief repre-
2aentatives of the latter school; of the
former Alcman and Stesichorus, Ibycus,
Simonideffi‘Bacchylides, and Pindar. Stesi-
dmm and lby eus were most celebrated
for their poema on mythologn 'cal subj ects
v,(‘ divos puerosque deorum ¹), while Siiizon-
idas and Pindar were the greatest in
,en-ulma, hy mus in honour of the victors
at public gamen (‘ et pugilem victorem et
certamine primum ’), while the
poem of wine and passion (‘ juvenum curas
‚et libera vina') were Alcaeus, Sappho, Si-
munides, and Bacchylides Horace does
not mention the threnes or dirges for the
dead, of which Simonides was the greatest
master.
As to ‘libera vina‚'see S. i. 4. 87 n.
86. Diseriptas servare vices] I do not
Δ find that any MSS. have‘ discrip tas: but
4Ι am inclined to think that is pthe true
¹reading3 and conamen-ing, as 1 have said
before, that‘ discribo’ is a genuine form,

and that the MSS. are unufe guides in
regard to this word, 1 have adopted‘ dis-
criptas' in preferenceto‘ desei-ip tas? [See
Kruger’s note] (C. ii. 13. 23 ιι., and
Epp. i. 10. 20 n.) ‘Vices' are the parts
(S i. 10. 12‚· defendente vicem ), and with
‘ discriptas ’ it means the parts assigned to
each class of poetry. ‘operum colores,’
‘ the colouring of poems‚' is easily under-
stood.

88. pudens prave] ‘Through a false
shame,’ ‘ pudor malus ’ (Epp. i. 16. 24).
drgo. {ficati-⁸] ‘ The language of common

i y li e.’

91. coena Thyestae] See C. i. 6. 8 ιι.

92. decenter] Bentley, ιιροιι some au-
thority and on bad reasoning, substitutos

‘decentem’ for‘ decenterl the reading of
all the editions before him. Γ Bitter has
‘deoentem. ’]

94. Irata-sque Chremes] schremes' is
any father in a comedy. There is nothing
tragic or tumid in the language of Cliti-
pho’s father in Terence's play (fleant.
v. 4), which is referred to by the com-
mentators. [Ritter refers to the Andria
v. 3 and 4.] The intensive compound of

‘litigo' does not occur elsewhere. As to
‘plerumque‚’ in the sense of ‘interdum'
see S. ii. 5. 55 n.‚ and on ‘pedestri’ see
C. ii. 12. 9 ιι.

96. Telephus et Peleus] These persons
were the subjeets of many tragedias. Each
of the three tragedians wrote upon them,
