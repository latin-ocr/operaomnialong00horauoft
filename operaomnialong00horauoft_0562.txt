526 HORATII FLACCI
to renew your terrors and your punishment. Do you call yourself my master,
you whom no emancipation could free from bondage? I am your vicarius if you
please, or your fellow-slave. You are but a puppet, and your passions the strings
that work it.

Who then is free P He who has command over himself, who can bid defiance to
his lusts, and look down upon honours, who is complete in himself and proof against
the rubs of the world and of fortune. Do you recognize yourself here? Why your
mistress cheats you, dismisses, recalls you, and you cannot get your neck out of the
yoke 3 and yet you cry, I am free Ξ Then you let your senses be run away with by
a fine picture; and while poor Davus is abused if he stops for a moment to look at a
daub in the streetS, you are a connoisseur forsooth. 1 am good for nothing if I am
tempted with a cake piping hot. Are you more master of your appetite Ρ Why am
I worse than you P Your food will soon turn sour on your stomach, and. your legs
refuse to carry you. Which is worst, the slave who steals a seraper and gives it for
a bunch of grapes, or the master who sells his lands to feed his belly Ρ And then
you can’t live in yourself, but are always running away from care like a slave from
his lord3 but he follows you, go where you will.

Give me a stone.

What for P are you mad P

Be off with you, or 1’11 send you to work in the fields forthwith.

not think him too good to live’ ( S. 6. 82).
As to the Saturnalia, see S. 3. 5 n. The
mouth of December was dedicated to Sa-
turnus. Horace speaks of the licence of
that festival being a custom handed down
from their ancestors.

1. Jamdudum ausculto] We may sup-
pose Horace has been talking to a friend
upon subjects that have attracted his
slave’s attention, and give rise to the
points he ar.gues Or he may have been

giving Davus some good advice, and he

offers him a homily m return, recommend-
ing him, as Acron says, to practise what
he preaches.

3. Mancipium] This word, which pro-
perly signifies the act of taking possession,
‘manu eapiend0,’ is applied here to the
‘ res mancipi‚' the object of ‘ mancipium?
which in this instance is a slave. It is so
used in Epp. i. 6. 39, “ Mancipiis locuples
eget aeris Cappadocum rex.’' Respecting
the act of mancipation and the ‘ res man-
cipi,' see Smith's Dict. Ant„ arts. “ Man-
cipium and Dominium.'’

‘ honest enough.’]
4. Ut vitale putes] ‘That you need

As to ‘frugi, '
see S. 5. '7'7 n. [‘Frugi quod sit satis: ·'

6. Pars hominum] Davus avails him-
self without preface of his master-'s per-
mission, and begins to moralize on the
instability of some men, who never know
their own minds. This character he ap-
plies to his master 1n v. 23 sqq.

9. Oum tribus annellis] This is men-
tioned as a large number. In later times
the Romans wore a great profusiori of
rings on both hands. At this time they
were only worn on the left. Gellius (x.
10), quoting as his authority Apion’ s work
on Egyptian Antiquities, is the earliest
writer who propagated the vulgar error
that there was a nerve communicating
between the fourth finger of the left hand
