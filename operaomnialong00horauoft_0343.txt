contradiction by Orelli and Dillenbr„ con-
veys no meaning. ‘Car-men? for a volume
of‘ carmina‚' is an expression which raises
ι very natural doubt as to Horace’ s mean-

ι derived sense, “ad finem adducere? as
reasonably as th’e latter· ιιι a collective sense.
See Introduction. Whether‘ olim' belongs
to ‘inceptos' or‘ ’is open to
doubt. Bentley does not strengthen his
opinion that it belongs'to ‘promissum ’by
referring to A. P. 46: “Hoc spernat pro-
missi carminis auctorss’ The objection to

it with ‘in ’if ‘'cai-men
means the book of Epodea‘ is, that it would
imply that the different odoe were written
to form part- of a volume, whereas they
must have been written at intel-vals and
without reference to their collective pub-
lication.
