HORATII FLACCI

Quid refert uri, virgis ferroque necari
Auctoratus eas, an turpi clausus in arca,

Quo te demisit peccati conscia herilis,

59. Auctoratus eas] Though gladiators
were for the most part slaves or criminals,
freemen sometimes sold their services in
this capacity, and they were called ‘ aucto-
rati‚' and the price they received ‘ auctora-
mentum? So Suetonius says that Tiberius
exhibited gladiatoria] shows to the memory
of Augustus, and Drusus his grandfather,
and to increase the number he hired
several who had received their discharge,
“rudiariis quoque quibusdam revocatis
auctoramento centenum millium '’ (Tib. 8.
vii.). Such persons bound themselves by
a very stringent bond to the ‘ lanista'
who hired them. The words of this bond
“ are given in a passage of Petronius (c.
117): “In verba Eumolpi sacramentum
juravimus uri, vinciri, verberari, fen-oque
necari, et quicquid aliud Eumolpus jussis-
set; tanquam legitimi gladiatores domino
corpora animasque religiosissime addici-
mus.” The same words Seneca quotes
(Ep. 37): “ Promisisti virum bonum ; sa-
cramento obligatus es—Eadem honestis-
simi hujus et illius turpissimi auctoramenti
verba sunt uri, vinciri, ferroque necari ;'’
and this explains Juvenal's “ Scripturas
leges et regia verba lanistae '' (S. xi. 8).
The word is said to be derived from ‘ auc-
tor‚’ in the sense of ‘venditor,’ from the
person selling his services, that being a
particular sense of ‘ auctor’ as opposed to
‘emtor.' There is evidently a connexion
between the two words, but it is not easy
to see what it is3 for ‘ auctor’ is only ap-
plied to the seller as warranting the title.
—From the above passages it is clear that
‘uri’ is absolute3 it does not go with
‘virgis’ as some take it. [Some editors
prefer ‘uri virgis ferroque necari.’ The
infinitives depend on ‘auctor-atus? It is
‘ Quid refert utrum eas auctoratus uri 818.
an.'

6(]). conseia] See S. i. 2. 130, and J uve-
nal (iii. 49): “Quis nunc diligitur nisi
conscius ?” ‘ Conscius’ means au accom-
plice. The man asks what difference it
makes whether a freeman goes and lets
himself to a ⁸ lanista' to be beaten and
tortured at his will, or runs the risk, in

furtherance of his amours, of being shut
up head and heels together in a dirty old
chest by his mistress's slave-girl, to keep
out of the way of her husband. [Comp.
Juvenal, vi. 44.]

[61. Estne] This must be translated
‘ has not ?’

visions of the laws respecting adultery re-·
pealed by the J ulia lex, passed ΛΑΜ). 736
or thereabouts (C. iv. 5. 21), is not
known. That they affected the wife's
‘ dos’ we have seen in S. i. 2. 131. Gel-
lius (x. 23) quotes a speech of the elder
Cato, “De Dote,’' by which it appears
that the husband had then power to put
his wife to death if he caught 1181· 111 the
act of adultery3 and if so he must have
had that power at the time Horace wrote,
for the law had not been altered. The
words of Cato, who died 3.(1. 149, are
these: “ Vir quum divortium fecit mulieri

judex pro censore est. Imperium quod

videtur habet. Si quid perverse tetreque
factum est a muliere, multatur: Si vinum
bibit, si cum alieno viro probri quid fecit,
condemnatur.—In adulterio uxorem tuam
si deprehendisses¹ sine judicio impune ne-
cares. Illa te si adulterares digito nou
auderet contingere 3 neque jus est.” This
Davus would eall hard measure against
women: “ Ecastor lege dura vivunt mu-
lieres '³ (Plautus, Mercat. iv. 6. 1). The
partiality which Davus' words imply was
corrected by the above law of Augustus,
which gave the husband power to kill the
adulterer 111 certain cases, but not to kill
his wife. It is clear from this Satira and
the second of the first book that the in-
jured husband might do pretty much as
he pleased‚ or was able, to revenge him-
self on the adulterer, without fear of the
