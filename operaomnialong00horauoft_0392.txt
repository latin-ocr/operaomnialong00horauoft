HORATII FLACCI

Cum ventum ad verum est; sensus moresque repugnant,
Atque ipsa utilitas, justi prope mater et aequi.
Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,

Mutum et turpe pchS, glandem atque cubilia propter

100

Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
Pugnabant armis quae post fabricaverat usus,
Donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
Nominaque invenere ς dehinc absistere bello,

Oppida coeperunt munire et ponere leges,

105

Ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis adulter.
Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus teterrima belli
Causa, sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,
Quos venerem incertam rapientes more ferarum

Viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus,

J ura inventa metu injusti fateare necesse est,
Tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.
Nec natura potest justo secernere iniquum,
Dividit ut bona diversis, fugienda petendis;

it with ‘laborantl If it qualifies ⁴ paria‚’
then it limits the doctrine of au faults
being equal. But ‘ fere ’ may qualify
‘ placuit‚' and thentoo the general doctrine

81, aequi,' the valne of his assertion depends
on the sense which we give to ‘utility.’
If we take it to mean the advantage
of every member of a community, hc
is certainly right, for utility is the mea-
sure by which we judge of the value of
rules of law and the usages of society ; and
this is true whatever notions we may have
of what is sometimes called a moral sense.
Praetically we form our estimate of ‘jus-
tum ’ and ‘ aequum ' by applying the mea-
sure of utility.]

[99. primis terris] ‘The new-made
earth ' (S. ii. 2. 93). Η8 assignsa beginning
of some kind to the earth ς but we need not
suppose that he could have told us what
he meant. Ritter says that ‘animalia '
are ‘living beings ε’ “ intelligit enim ea
animalia tantum uude homines evaserint :''
but he does not explain his meaning. Ho-
race supposes that man at first could not
speak, and this opinion has been revived in
our time. Compare Lucretius v. 1026.]

102. usus] Here this signifies ‘need.’ It
generally occurs (in this sense) in combina-
tion with ‘ est ’ or ‘ venit! ⁶ Verba nomina-
que ’ conventionally embraces all the parts
of speech, like the Greek ὀνόματα καὶ

ῥήματα. ‘Notae ’ are symbols, as in short-
hand writing for instance3 and this 11118
may perhaps be most accurately rendered,
‘ till they invented language whereby they
could give a symbolica] form to the sounds
of their voice and 1ο their seelings?

[111. Jura inventa metu injmti] ‘ J um ’
in the Roman sense comprehends all law:
‘ Constant autem jura ex legibus, plebi-
scitis, senatusconsultis, constitutionibus
Principum, edictis eorum qui jus edicendi
habent, responsis prudentium ’ (Gaius, i.
ξ 2). It may be translated ‘rules of law‚'
and must be distinguished from ‘jus’ in
the sense of ‘just,' or τὸ δίκαιον]

112. evolvere] This word, which significa
‘to read‚’ is taken from the unrolling of a
parchment ‘ usque ad umbilicum? See
Epod. xiv. 8 n.

114. bona diversis] ‘ Boua ’ means
things which it is good to have and to get,
not virtues, but the gista of fortune and
such like. [Here Horace has the much
used and much abused word ‘natur-133⁹ and
§.²5:22³ 331022313'2531313105315522timisti-‘3
meaning. Perhaps ‘ natura ¹ means man
in his natural state ς but then we must ex-
plain what man's natural state is. Accord-
ing to Horace it would be man's condition
before experience had taught him the mles
necessary for the conservation and progress
of society.]
