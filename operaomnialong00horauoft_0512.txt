Non est cardiacus (Craterum dixisse putato)
Hic aeger: recte est igitur surgetque? Negabit,
Quod latus aut renes morbo tentantur acuto.
Non est perjurus neque sordidus3 immolet aequis

Hic porcum Laribus : verum ambitiosus et audax3

Naviget Anticyram. Quid enim differt, barathrone
Dones quidquid habes an nunquam utare paratis ⁴?

161. Craterum dixisse putato] Cicero
speaks of Craterus as attending the daugh-
ter of Atticus during her illness, A.U.c.
'709; ‘⁸ de Attica doleo: credo autem
Cratero ” (ad Att. xii. 13, Sc v. 14). He is
mentioned by Pei-'sius (S. iii. 65) :

“——· Venienti occurrite morbo.
Et quid opus Cratero magnos promittere
montes '’

As tn ‘ cardiacum’ Heindorf quotes Celsus’
definition (iii. 19) ε “ Nihil aliud est quam
nimia imbecillitas corporis quod stomacho
languente immodico sudore digeritur.'’

163. morbo tentantur αιίιίο] This verse
is repeated Epp. i. 6. 28. ‘ Morbus acutus‚’
‘ an acute disease,' is opposed to ‘ longus:
‘a chronic disease!

— [tentantur] Τ118 better reading
is perhaps ‘ temptentur’ or ‘tenten-
tur.’ The disease of the ‘latus’ is
πλευρῖτις. The disease of the ‘renes' is
νεφρῖτις. Celsus, iv. 6, and 10 quoted by
Ritter, describes the morbus πλευριτικός
and the Renum morbus.]

165. porcum Laribus] C. iii. 23. 4.
‘Let him offer a thanksgiving to his
Lares, who have protected him from those

Vlcfdii. barabba-one] The Scholiasts, MSS„

and editions vary in respect to this word.
Acron reads ‘ Balatroni‚' and explains it as
the name of a ‘ scurra ineptuS‚’ the usual
description of indifferent characters not
otherwise known. Porphyrion notices
‘ barathro' as a various reading. All
Orelli's MSS. have ‘barathrone‚’ and he
adopts that word, which he explains as

¹70

sense in which it is used before (S. i. 2. 2
n). He mentions two MSS. in its favour,
and Fea mentions others. Fea himself
adopts ‘ balatrone ’ (‘ balatrone ’ being the
nominative, ⁴ utrum ut balatro '), which
Bentley seems to prefer. 'l'he great pre-
ponderance of authority is in favour of
‘barathrone’ But any pit will do. We
need not go to Athens or Sparta.

168. Servius Oppidius] This person
lived at Canusium. (See i. 5. 91 n.). ‘His
property was reducedto two fax-ms, though
his ancestors were rich. This is Orelli's
explanation. The more obvious one is that
he was rich, even with two farms, accord-
ing to the standard of incomes in the old
times. This is Acron’s interpretation,
which Heindorf approveS. As to the form
‘divisse,’ see S. 1. 5. 79.

171. talos-nucesque] The ‘talus ' was
the knuckle-bone of some animal, generally
a sheep, the Greek ἀστράγαλος. The man-
ner of playing with it was the same among
the Greeks and the Romans, and the same
bones are still used by boys in England.
The ancients used them in games of skill
and of chance; for the latter purpose they
were marked as dice, and thrown usually
from a box called ‘fritillus‚’ ‘ phimus‚’ &c.
(S. ii. 7. 17 n., and Becker-’s Gallus, on the
‘ Social Games: and Dict. Ant). Boys
had also games of various kinds with nuts,
as they have now. Suetonius relates that
Augustus “animi laxandi causa modo
piscabatur hamo, modo talis aut ocellatis
nucibusque ludebat cnm pueris minutis ''
(Octav. 83), where, according to Forcel-
lini, ‘ ocellatis’ means small round stones

some deep pit, such as malefactor-s were like eyes. Oppidius observed that his son

thrown into at Athens and Lacedaemon.
All the editions till Bentley have ‘bara-
throne.' He edits ‘balatrone,’ not as a
proper name, like the 88110118818, but in the

Aulus carried about his bones and his nuts
in a careless way in a loose fold of his toga,
ready to give them away to any of his
companions or to lose them at play 5 while ἶ
