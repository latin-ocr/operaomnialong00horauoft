HORATII FLACCI

Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis
Auspiciis veterumque norma.

1. Jam pauca aratro] Tiberius com-
plained to the senate that Rome was de-
pendent ou the provinces for her corn, and
was at the mercy of the winds and waves,

³ which might at any time cut off the supply

and reduce the citizens to live on their
ornamental woods and country houses.
(Comp. Sall. Cat. 13.)

2. undique latius] The Scholiasts have
misunderstood these w ords, joining ‘ latius'
with ‘visentur,' as if Horace meant ‘the
expanded waters of the Lucrine lake will
be overlooked more widely, i. e. from lofty
houses built on its banks. Cicero (ad Att-
i. 18, 19, 20) complains that some of his
contemporaries (‘piscina1·ii ’ he calls them)
were so devoted to their fish-ponds, that
they cared more for them than for all the
interests of the state, as if this might fall
and they still keep their playthings : “ Ita
sunt stulti ut amissa re publica piscinas
suas fore salvas sperare videantur '' (18) ;
and again, “Nunc vero cum—nostri prin-
cipes digito se caelum putent attingere, si
mulli barbati in piscinis sint qui ad manum
accedant, alia autem negligant, nonne tibi
satis prodesse videor,” διο. (ἰί. 1). He calls
them ‘piscinarum Tritones ’ (ii. 9).

5. tum violaria] This is opposed to
‘tum laurea' (v. 9).

6. Myrtus] This word is of two declen-
sions. So likewise are ‘quercuS,’ ‘laurus,’
‘pinu8,’ ‘cornus‚’ ‘ficus,’ and, as Bentley
’11ἒέ ³?{{}¹}{s{f12¹33 ιῖἷίῗ ἴιῗέ 1ἓὶᾛῖἰέ 1313
generally received all assign the last word
to the second dcclension. In a very ele-
gant illustration of the ornaments of speech
Quintilian has the following passage: “An
ego fundum cultiorem putem in quo mihi
quis ostenderet lilia et violas et anemonas,
fontes surgentes, quani ubi plena messis

aut graves fructu vites erunt? Sterilem
platanum tonsasque myrtos quam maritam
ulmum et uberes oleas praeoptaverim Ρ
Habeant illa divites licet 3 quid essent si
nihil aliud haberent ?’' (Inst. viii. 3. 8),
in which ‘myrtus’ occurs of the second
declension, and ‘maritam ulmum ' explains
‘platanus caelebs. ’ [The plane was only
for ornament. the elm was married to the
vine. SeeEpp .i. 7. 84, and 16. 3, a‘micta
vitibus ulmo? ‘Omnis copia narium'
being placed with ‘violaria' and‘ myrtus’
must mean something of a like kind, but

this junction of ‘copia’ and ‘narium’ is Δ

singular. It seems to mean ‘all that fills
the nostrils.']

10. ictus] Some MSS. have ‘aestua’
‘ Haud dubie ex interpretatione,' says Jani.
Lucretius uses ‘ictus :’ “Qui quoniam
quodam gignuntur luminis ictu '’ (ii. 808),
“ aestiferum ut tantum radiorum exaugeat
ictum'’ (v. 612). Ovid also (Met. v. 389),
“ Phoebeos submovet ictus '' (not ‘ignes ’).
Bentley remarks that Horace is holder in
putting‘ ictus’ by itself, without ‘solis‚'
‘radiorumss διο. But ‘fervidos' is nearly
equivalent to any of those genitivos.

— Non ita Romuli] Aul. Gellius (ii.
24) introduces his account of certain an-
cient sumptuary laws with these words,
“ Parsimonia apud veteres Romanos et
victus atque coenarum tenuitas non do-
mestica solum observatione ac disciplina
sed publica quoque animadversione legum-
que complurium sanctionibus custodita
est.''

11. intonsi] The commentators inform
us from Pliny (N. H. vii. 59) that the age
of shaving at Rome began A.U.c. 454, when
barbers were first imported from Sicily.
But the conventional sense of ‘ intonsi,' in
which alone it could apply to the Censor
