HORATII FLACCI

Pupillis quos dura premit custodia matrum ς
Sic mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora, quae spem
Consiliumque morantur agendi naviter id quod

Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque,

25

Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit.

Restat ut his ego me ipsc regam solerque elementis.
Non possis oculo quantum contendere Lynceus,
Non tamen idcirco contemnas lippus inungi ς

Nec quia desperes invicti membra Glyconis,

allowed to change was limited by the will.
In the former case 1181· guardianship might
be ‘dura‚' oppressive and mischievous, as
of course it might be in many other ways
if she were an unnatural mother; but
Horace means that it was irksome to boys,
because they wished to be their own mas-
ters. ‘ Tutores’ were only choscn by the
mother if she was expressly authorized by
the will: they were often named by the
testator himself, or he authorized some
one else to appoiut. If a man died in-
testate, the nearest ‘ agnatus‚’ male rela-
tive, or several if there were several in the
same degree, became ‘ tutores ’ to his chil-
dren 3 and if he had none, or if they were
disqualified, the Praetor urbanus found
‘tutores' (see Dict. Ant. art. ‘'Putor').
Thus ‘ tutela’ and ‘ custodia' were dif-
ferent things.

25. locupletibus aeque] ‘Aeque’ is re-
peated though not wanted, just as ‘ inter’
is repeated in S. i. 7. 11 11. and elsewhere.
Ven. 1483 has ‘ locupletibus: atque aeque
neglectum ;' and some other editions have
the same. But it does not get rid of the
repetition, and is a vile reading. Tacitus
(Agric. c. 15) has “ acque discordiam
praepositorum aeque concordiam subjectis
exitiosam‚'' where some have proposed to
read ‘ atque’ 111 the second clause. Ovid
has-

“ Et pariter Phoebes, pariter maris ira re-
cessit '' (Met. xii. 36) ς

and again 2——

“Cantantis pariter, pariter data pensa
trahentis

Fallitur ancillae decipiturque labor.’'
(Trist. iv. 1. 13.)

Τ118 Greek writers used ὁμοίως 111 the
same way, as Xenophon (Hieron. x. 5),
τοῖς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ἐργάταις καὶ κτήνεσιν
οὗτοι ἂν εἰκότως καὶ θάρσος καὶ ἀσφάλειαν
δύναιντο μάλιστα παρέχειν, ὁμοίως μὲν τοῖς
σοῖς ἰδίοις, ὁμοίως δὲ τοῖς ἀνὰ τὴν χώραν.

See also Plato (Symp. p. 386), ὅθεν δὴ
ξυμβαίνει αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι τοῦτο
πράττειν ὁμοίως μὲν ἀγαθὸν, ὁμοίως δὲ
τουναιςτίον.

27. Restat ut his] Horace says 118 18
impatient till he shall have reached the
perfection of active virtue and wisdom.
But meanwhile all he can do is to regu-
late and comfort his mind with such
elementary knowledge of truth as he pos-
sesses; for if he cannot reach perfection,
he may make some steps towards it.
‘His’ means what he has at his com-
mand. The keen sight of Lynceus, who,
as the silly story goes, could from Lily-
baeum count the number of vessels in a
fleet coming out of the harbour of Carthago
(Val. Max. i. 4. 8), is proverbial. The
reading of nearly every MS. is ‘oculo
quantum contendere.’ Lambinus, on the
authority of one, edited ‘ oculos.’ Bentley,
acknowledging that ‘oculo' will do very
well as to construction, follows Lambinus
for an odd reas0n2—“Plux-alis hic nu·
merus arridet magis quia noster utrumque

ocghgg collyrio inungere solebat ut Serm.

‘ {hic oculis ego nigra meis collyria lippus
mere.

Nollet ergo singulari ambigue uti.” [¹ Non
possis ε’ ‘if you cannot ς’ 0118 of the hypo-
thetical forms.]

30. invicti membra Glyconis] Acron
says this person was “ athleta quidam for-
tissimus ;'’ and in the Anthologia. (Brunck.
Anal. vol. ii. p. 1263 Ep. 68) there is an
Epigram of Antipater of Thessalonica on
one Glyco, an athlete of Pergamum, whom
he calls ὁ παμμάχων κεραυνός, ὁ πλατὺς
πόδας, ὁ πάντα νικῶν, κ.τ.λ. Lessing· (Op.
vol. viii. p. 526) has made this Glyco to
be 3 contemporary of Horace, and the
person here alluded t0. The Famese Her-
cules is the work of Glycon, the sculptor
of Athens, and some have supposed Horace
to refer to this statue, which they imagine
