8. excubat in genis] This is a close imi-
tation of Sophocles (Antig. 728),—

Ἔρως ὃς ἐν κτήμασι πίπτεις
ὃς ἐν μαλακαῖς παρειαῖς
νεάνιδος ἐννυχεύεις.

9. aridas quercus] This corresponds to
C. i. 25. 19, ‘aridas frondes ;’ as to ‘lux-idi:
see C. iii. 4. 74 n. ‘Te' is dependent on
‘refugit’ and ‘turpant ' in both instances.
‘ Capitis nives’ Quintilian (viii. 6. 1'7)
quotes as an instance of far-fetched meta-
phor (translatio) 3 which has found its

13. Coae] The transparency of the Coan
vestments is noticed S. i. 2. 101 n.

14. olari] This, not ‘ cari,' is the read-
ing of the greater number of MSS. and of
the Scholiasts. Bentley, Ι think with bad
tastc, prefers ‘cari’ [Ritter and Keller
have ‘cari.'] The precious stones of the
costlier sort most in use by Roman women
were pearls (margaritae) and emeralds

libertinae distinguished for their beauty
could make a great display of jewels re-
ceived as presents from their admirere.

15. Notis condita fastis] The days she
has seen are all buried, as lt were, in
the grave of the public annals (as Acron
says), and there any onc may find them,

but she cannot get them back. It is a
graphio way of identifying the years and
their departure, to point to the record in
which each is distinguished by the consuls
and the leading· events. ‘Notis' expresses

the publicity and notoriety of the record ¹

by which the lapse of time is marked.

18. illius, illius] This word is very em-
phatic, as in “quantum mutatus ab illo
Hectore '³ (Aen. ii. 274). On ‘surpuerat'
compare “unum me surpite morti '’ (Sat.
ii. 3. 283) C. i. 36. 8 n.; S. i. 5. 79 n. Re-
garding Cinara, see C. iv. 1. 3 n. 3 and for
the form ‘ nota artium gratarum' compare
‘¹ notus in fratres animi paterni ” (C. ii. 2.
6). [But the sense is ‘facies et nota et
artium gratarumss ‘a face of pleasing
charms? CompareC. iv. 1. 15.] ‘Parem
temporibus is not well explained by
Orelli,‘ ‘donec effecta sit par. '’ It means
rather that Lyce and the crow go on
together getting old and never dy ying. ⁷
‘Vetulae’ is a contemptuons form of
‘annosa' used elsewhere (C. iii. 17. 13).
Martial speaks of an old woman who had
survived all the crows (x. 67). She was the
daughter (he says) of Pyrrha, and N estor's
stepmother, an old woman when Niobe was
a girl, grandmother of Laertem, nurse of
Priam, and mother· in· law of Th y.estes

28. ’Dila psam] ‘'Delapsam is in many
MSS. but few editors have adopted it, and
‘dilapsam’ is plainly the word which ex-
