sor ‘ 'vetet' ought not absolutely to decide in this passage. There
318 1πο objections 10 ‘vetat :’ 0118 18 1118 form ‘ Teque‚’ by which
this line is connected with the preceding, which contains ‘ vivas ς’
and the other is the difficulty of being certain about the meaning of
‘ laevus: which, as some critics suppose, signifies ‘ infaustus: a
meaning which is consistent either with ‘ vetet' or ‘ vetat? If
‘ laevus’ signifies ‘ auspicious,’ theu we have with ‘ vetat’ this
meaning, ‘ And thee neither the auspicious woodpecker nor the
wandering crow ἴοι-11111810 g0,’ which is plainly not sense. I am not
sure about the meaning of ‘vaga,' but I think it has aninauspicious
meaning. The passage‘is curious, and it might be discussed before

Mt. Macleane observes that he has not aoeepted a single con-
jecture made by Bentley. These conjectures, it is said, amount to
several hundreds. As far 38 Ι know, very few of Bentley's 8011-
