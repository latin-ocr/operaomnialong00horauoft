GARMEN II. ‘

Horace, meaning to write an ode onthe moderatedesire and use orn-enlm dedicated
it to C. Sallustius Crispus, grand-nephew of the historiari and inheritor of his property.
Helndpmviously alludedto himin no termsof praise in Sat. i. 2. 48; but that Satire
m writtm many years before this ode, and at this time Sallustius was in high favour
'with Augustus and possessed of great richae, of which Horace implioe that he made a
guod uae. From the reference to Phraates’ retum to his throne (v. 17), which took
place Ast-c. ¹124·(see C. i'. 26, Introduc-timi), the ode must have been written aster that
evmt. Proculeius mentioned' ιιι v. 5 was brother or cousin (it ιε not certain which) to
Licinius Murena, who am. c. 732 was detected m a conspiracy with one Fannius caepio
ω take away the life of Augustus (see C. ii. 10, Introduction). 1 cannot infer so posi-
tively as Franke and others do that Horace would have abstained from mentioning the
guerosity of Proculeius, if his relation’ s crime had been committed when he wrote; but
that chmnologist takes this allusion as an argument that the ode was written between
aar-c. '729 and 732, and from the tone of the allusion to Phraates he supposes his resto·
ration to have been recent, and assigus the ode to the year 730, in which Orelli aud
Dillenhr. agree with him.

⁴ ARGUMENT.

Silver hath no beauty while hid in the earth, Sallustius who despisest the ore till it is
polished by moderate use. Proculeius for his generosity to his brethren will live for
eve, and the man who mles the spirit. of avarice is a greater king than if from (hr-
thage to Gades were all his own. ΤΙιε dropsy grows and grows filtits cause is ex—
pelled. Phraates restored to his throne is not imppp-3 he only is a king'and conqueror
who looks on money with indifferenoe.
