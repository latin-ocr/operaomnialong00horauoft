HORATII FLACCI

Maluit esse deum. Deus inde ego furum aviumque

Maxima formido 3 nam fures dextra coercet , ⁷
Obscoenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus ; 5
Ast importunas volucres in vertice arundo

Terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis.

Huc prius angustis ejecta cadavera cellis

conservus vili portanda locabat in arca.

In this rough way all the' images of this
god were made, and the ancients had little
respect for him, unless it were those of the
lowest sort3 though ιιι the same epigram
that contains the above absurd description
of the god he is prayed to for deliverance
from the power of love, and Horace, who
treats him so contemptuously here, speaks
of him elsewhere (Epod. ιι. ), in eonjunction
with Silvanus, as receiving the sacrifice
due to him. No one could better have ap-
preciated than a Roman of Horace' s way of
thinking, whether in respect to this deity
or any other, the ironical description of the
prophet Isaiah (xliv. 9—20), which corre-
sponds so closely with this passage that I
· recommend the reader to referto it. There
is no stroke in the whole of that description
more severe than Horace’s “incertus seam-
num faceretne Priapum maluit esse deum.''
Not much less in the same strain is that

address of Martial (viii. 40) ε

“ Non horti neque palmitis beati
ἓῗζέἲῃῖῖῗὲῗεῖἓῗῖξέ ἓέἒὲἓέῐ,
Furaces moneo manus repellas,

Et silvam domini focis reserves.
Si defecerit haec et ipse lignum es.’'

The figures of Priapus were generally busts
like the Hermae, but sometimes they were
full length of the kind Horace describes.
Usually they held a sickle or a club in
the right hand by way of frighteuing
thieves [‘ cnm falce salignQ’Virg.Ge01-g.
iv. 110], and a wisp of straw, or something
of that sort, to frighten the birds. Priapus
also symbolized the fertility of nature in
the later mythology of the Greeks as well
” as the Romans. In Agostini's collection of
gems (part‘ 1i. pl. 13) there' isone rep1 esent-

The offerings are a goat’ s head and fruits,

which a woman is laying on a rude altar,

while a man is bringing up a. basket on his
head containing more fruit and ‘phalliss

which formed a feature in the worship of
Bacchus as well as of Priapus. These two
were honoured alike as presiding, the one

over vineyards, the other over gardens-
this accounts for the thyrsus ιιι the figure,
which' is a combination of the two divini-
ties.

6. importunas volucres] virgil applies
the same epithet to‘ destructive birds.

“Obscoenaeque canes importunaeque volu·
cres’ '(Georg. i. 470). Cruquius explains
the word thus. “Quod sine ulla Dei reve·
rentia quovis tempore essent molestae.”

7. Huc prius anqustis] Ontside of the
walls in front of Mons Esquilinus lay the
Campus Esquilinus, in which were buried
the poorest of the people iu ill-<lug graves,
which had the name ‘ puticuli, whether
as the diminutive of ‘putei,’ or from the
putrefaction of the co and the stench
thereby occasioned, Varro hesitates to de·

stated with painful satire. The poorwretaeh

expense of hiring (‘ locabat ') ‘ vespillones ’
(common empse-hearers, νεκροφόρους) to
carry him out on a bier to the public
burial-gronnd, where his corpsewas tossed
naked into a pit into which other corpses
had been tossed before. [It is said indeed
(Dig. 11. 7. 31) that if a man buried an-
other man's slave, male or female, he could
recover the expenses by action. But this
rule of law may be late, as it is mentioned
by Ulpian; and besides this, it does not
mean that a slave could bring such an

dapila,' whose narrow dimensions are re-
ferred to in an epigram of Martini (ii. 81),
where he says of the stout Zoilus :—

“ Laxior hexaphoris tna sit lectica licebit,
Dum tamen haec tua sit, Zoile, sanda-
pila est-’³
And again, speaking of a mistress whose
extravagant demands were reducing her
lover to poverty (ix. 3),—
“Octo Syris suffulta datur lectica puellae:
