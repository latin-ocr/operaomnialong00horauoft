Duci ventre levem, nasum nidore supinet,
Imbecillus, inem, si quid vis, adde popino.

Tu, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior, ultro

40

Insectere velut melior verbisque decoris

Obvolvas vitium?

Quid, si me stultior ipso
Quingentis empto drachmis deprenderis?

Aufer

Me vultu ‘terrere5 manum stomachumque teneto,

Dum quae Crispini docuit me janitor edo.

45

Te conjux aliena capit, meretricula Davum.

Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius ⁴? Acris ubi me
Natura intendit, sub clara nuda lucerna
Quaecunque excepit turgentis verbera caudae,

Clunibus aut agitavit equum lasciva supinum,

50

Dimittit neque famosum neque sollicitum ne
Ditior aut formae melioris meiat eodem.

'ru cum projectis insignibus, annulo equestri
Romanoque habitu, prodis ex judice Dama

Turpis, odoratum caput obscurante lacerna,

55

Non es quod simulas ⁴? Metuens induceris atque

ner. ‘ Nasum nidore supinor,’ ‘ 1 snuff up
my nose at the smell of a dinner.¹
⁶ N'idor’ means ‘nidor culinae? as in J uv.
v. 1622 “Captum te nidore suae putat
ille culinae? and Martial, i. 93. 9:
&Paeonis et nigrae solo nidore eulinae.”
‘ Popino’ is an idle dissolute fessow, a fre-
quenter of ‘ popinae: wok-shops. (S. 4.
62 n.) Suetonius (de Illust. Gram. c. 15)
says that Lenaeus, a teacher at Rome and
ι freedman of Pompeius Magnus, used to
revile Sallust the historian, and called him
“ lautam-mn et lurconem et nebulonem
popinonemque.”‘ ⁴ 'ru—ultro insectere‚'
:w 535. ῗὲῗὶῗέῗιῗΐ εἶῗὲὤᾱέῗῗ
See S. 6. 30, ‘tu pulses? and C. iv. 4. 51 n.

42. Quid, εἰ me] Davus on in
his own person. Five hundred drachmae,
reckonIng the dmchma and the denarius
as nearly the same value (about ΒΜ),
which was the case about this time,
amounts to 1¹71. 152. of our money, and
this was a small price, only given for
inferior slaves. The price varied very
widely according to the beauty of the
slaves (of either sex), which enhanced
their valae more than any thing else,
or according to their education, or skill
in handicmflzs, ἃς. ‘Aufer me terrere?
literally ‘ away with that frighoening me.'
[See S. ii. 3. 236] Davus sees his master

frowning and listing his hand u> strike
him. [Ritter elmerus, that the best MSS.
have ‘ dragmis' in this passage.]

45. Cri-«pini docuit me janitor] See
S. i. 1. 120 n. Davus professes to have
got at second hand from the slave of Cris-
pinus the arguments he is going to pro·
pound. They are put generally, and he
uses his own name ς but the pronoun ‘ te '
means any one. The ‘janitor-‚⁹ who was
also called ‘ostiariusf kept the door of
the house. He had a room on each side
of the ‘ostium,’ which was a space be-
tween the outer and inner door.

47. cruce dignius] See S. i. 3. 82.

53. annulo equestri] See above, v. 9 n.
The person is supposed to be an ‘ eques,’
and one of the ‘judices selecti' (S. i. 4.
123 n.)‚ and to have put off his toga and
thrown over him by way of disguise a
loose cloak, ‘ lacerna‚’ which gai-ment had
sometimes a hood, ‘ cucullus: to go over
the head, and that is supposed to be the
case here. Martial (xiv. 132): “Si pos-
sem, totas cuperem misisse lacernas‚” by
which he means a ‘ lacerna' with the hood
complete. The ‘ lacerna' was usually
worn over the ‘ toga‚’ but here that gar-
ment (‘ Romanus habitus’) is laid aside.
perfumed
oil, like Varus’ in Epod. v. 59. See Epp-
i. 14. 32 n. -
