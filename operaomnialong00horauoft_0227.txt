ΑΒΘῸΉΕΝΤ.

Anweumb thalitmoesofher whelpa Pyrrhus. That girl willrush totherescueofher
lover, and like a coward and thief thou shalt quit the field aster a hard-fought battle
in which he shall stand like Nireus or Ganymede, the umpire of the fight.

Non vides quanto moveas periclo,
Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos leaenae ’Β
Dura post paullo fugies inaudax
Proelia raptor
Cum per obstantes juvenum catervas 5
Ibit insignem repetens Nearchum,
Grande certamen tibi praeda cedat
« Major an illi.
Interim, dum tu eeleroe sagittas
Promis, haec dentes acuit timendos,
Arbiter pugnae posuisse nudo
Sub pede palmam
Fertur, et leni recreare vento
Sparsum odoratis humerum capillis,
Qualis aut Nireus fuit aut aquosa
Raptus ab Ida.

fiand ehewhere, is the Greek ἄτολμος.

οι· like Ganymede. The differenee between
the perfect and the present, the one as re-
presenting a complete, and the other a con-
tinuing action, is here clearly marked. (See
C. i. 1. 4 n.) ‘ Fertur' a little disturbs
the character of the description as a paint-
ing, whether we interpret with Dillenbr„
who sup a real story to be the subject
of the ode, and has no faith in a Greek ori-
ginal, or with Orelli, who understands it
to mean the remarks of the spectators look-
ing on at this scene as it might be repre-
sented on a stage or in a picture. The latter
does not satisfy me, and the word is oue of
which it is difficult to fix the exact mean-
ing. 1 cannot help thinking that this too
savours of a pretty literal copy, and indi-
cates a composition not flowing from the
mind of the writer, and therefore liable to
some confusion, though to him it was plain
enough. [⁸ Aquosa ς’ Bomer's πολνπὶδαξ.]
