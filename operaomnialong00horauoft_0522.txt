HORATII FLACCI

Gaudes si cameram percusti forte, penes te es ⁶?
Quid, cum balba feris annoso verba palato,

Aedificante casas qui sanior?

Stultitiae atque ignem gladio scrutare.

Absolves hominem et sceleris damnabis eundem,

was sometimes divided. See C. ii. 18. 2:
‘⁶ Non ebur neque aureum mea renidet in
domo 1acunar.” Pliny (xxxiii. 3) says,
“Laquearia quae nunc et in privatis do-
mibus auro teguntur, post Carthaginem
eversam primo inaurata sunt in Capito·
lio.” ‘Laquear' is another form of ‘la-
cunm-‚⁵ Horace also uses the expression
‘laqueata tecta’ (C. ii. 16. 11), which is
found in other writers. Ovid alone uses
the word ‘ lacunare‚’ to form such ceilings
(Met. viii. 563.) [‘ Percusti :³ Comp.

‘ erepsemuS‚' S. i. 9. 79].
’ 273. penes te es] This seems to cor-
respond to the Greek ἐν ἑαυτῷ εἶναι for a
man in his right mind.

274. cum balbaferis] Persius has imi-

tated this in a different connexion (i. 33):—1

“Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare lo·
Phycllliiliiss, H ypsipylas, vatum et plorabile
Εϋξιιιέὺῖἒο tenero supplantat verba pa·

a o.

Persius says ‘he trips his words on his
mincing palate 3' Horace says ‘ you strike
your lisping words against your old
alate?
p 275. Adde cruorem Stultitiae] But
childish nonsense is not the worst of this
madness. Add bloodshcd to solly, and run
into the most violent excesses of passion,
and you will not do more than such lusts
commonly lead to· Such is the Stoic's
meaning. ⁵ Ignem gladio serutare’ is a.
translation of a Greek saying, πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ
σκαλεύειν, ‘ to stir the fire with the sword,’
which Diogenes Laert. (viii. 17) attributes
to Pythagoras. Heindorf says it is capa-
ble of various interpretations. The ap-
plieation here seems plain. Το stir the fire
of lust with the sword, is to stir up strife and
bloodshed in the indulgence of your lusts.
276. Modo, inqucvm, Hellade percussa]
‘ To take a late instance,’ seems to be the
meaning of ‘ modo.' [Ritter has ‘gladio

scrutare mod0‚ inquam? All this passage
‘adde cruorem . . . inquam' is difficult.
'rba explanation given on v. 275 is as good
as any that I can find in the commenta-
tors, and much better than some.] The
story here referred to, as Estre says, was
probably well known at the time. ‘Cer-
ritus: Festus says, is another form of
‘ cereritus,’ which signifies amitten by
Ceres ς but striking men mad was not, as
far as Ι am aware, one of the functions of q
that goddess· [wei-ritus, cerebro non
sanus, quasi cerebritus, vocabulum a Plau-
to ascitum,’ Ritter.] ‘Commotus’ is used
for different degrees of mental excitement.
See v. 209, where the meaning is the same
as here, ‘mad’ Agrippina, the wife of
Germanicus, who was of a hasty temper,
is called ‘paullo commotior’ by Tacitus
(Ann. i. 33). ‘Cognata vocabula' means
words which may differ in sound, but are
one in sense. “Diversa quidem, non ta-
men multum inter se distantia ’² (Acron.)-

281. Liber-tinus erat] The next folly
noticed is superstition. Stertinius tells a
story of an old ‘ libertinus‚' who went from
shrine to shrine erected in the ‘ oompita‚’
spots where two or more streets met, pray-
ing to the Lares Compitales (for whom
altars where built in such places3 see
above, v. 26 n.) that they would grant
him immortality. This he did early in the
morning, quite sober, and with hands
washed as became a serious worshipper.
Now this man was sound in hearing and
sight, but, says Stertinius, if his former
master had ever put him up for sale, he
would have cautioned purchasers that he
was not in his right mind, unless he
wanted to bring on himselfan action to
rescind the bargain on the ground of
fraud. It was necessary fora person selling
a slave to inform the buyer of any bodily or
mental defect. Seecicero de Off. iii.17 3 “In
mancipiorum venditione fraus venditoris

sanitate, de fuga, de furtis praestat edicto
