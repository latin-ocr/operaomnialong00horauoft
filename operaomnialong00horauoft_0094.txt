OARMEN XXVI.

At the time this ode was written it would appear that the affairs of the Parthians were
occupying a good deal of attention at Rome, since Horace speaks of himself as the only
one who gave 110 110οᾱ to them. The circumstances that may be supposed to be referred
to are to be gathered from the following account. In the yea1·A.U.c. 724, Phraates (see
Dict. Biog. Arsaces XV.) being on the Parthian throne, and having by his cruelties made
himself obnoxious to his subjects, Tiridates, likewise one of the family of Arsacidae, was
set up as a rival to Phraates, but was defeated in his attempt to dethrone him, and ssed
for protection that same year to Augustus, who was then in Syria, aster the death ot
M. Antonius. (Dion Cass. li. 18.) Shortly afterwards, however, the Parthians succeeded
in getting rid of their king, and Tiridates was called to the throne. In mmo. 729,
Phraates, having obtained assistance from the Scythiam, returned and recovered his
kingdom ς and Tiridates fled to Augustus once more for protection. He was then in Spain.
The following is J ustin’s account (though professing to give a particular history of Par-
thian affairs, he does not referto Tiridates’ former ill success) : Phraates, 110 says, elated
with his success against M. Antonius, grew more cruel than ever, and in consequence
“ in exilium a populo suo pellitur. Itaque cum magno tempore finitimas civitates, ad

Scytharum cum magna amicorum manu ad Caesarem in Hispaniam bellum tunc tem-
poris gerentem profugit obsidem Caesari minimum filium Phraatis ferens quem negli-
gentius custoditum rapuerat. Quo cognito Phraates legatos statim ad Caesarem mittit,
servum suum Tiridatem et filium remitti sibi postulat. Caesar et legatione Phraatis
audita et Tiridatis postulatis cognitis -neque Tiridatem dediturum se Parthis dixit
neque adversus Parthos Tiridati auxilia daturum. Ne tamen per omnia nihil a Caesare
obtentum videretur Phraati fllium sine pretio remisit, et Tiridati quoad manere apud
