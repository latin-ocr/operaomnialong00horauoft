Scilicet ut prostes Sosiorum pumice mundus.
Odisti claves et grata sigilla pudicoJ
Paucis ostendi gemis et communia laudas,

Non ita‘nutrituS.
Non erit emisso reditus tibi.

Fuge quo descendere gestis. 5
“ Quid miser egi?

Quid volui '?” dices ubi quis te laeserit, et scis·
In breve te cogi cum plenus languet amator.
Quodsi non odio peccantis desipit augur,

Carus eris Romae donec te deserat aetas;

Contrectatus ubi manibus sordescere vulgi
Coeperis, aut tineas pasces taciturnus inertes,

Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.

professes to rep roach his book for being
tiredpro ofsta ying at phome, and being shown
only to hisy friends, and wanting to go out
to the public, to which purpose he had not
' trained it. There can be no doubt that
what is here distinctly said of the Epistles
iu trun of the other works of Horace, that
were shown to his friends, aud circu-
lated privately before they were collected
and published.

7. pubi quis te laeserit] The MSS. vary
between* quis' and‘ quid? Bentley pre-
fers‘ quid! Comm. Cruq q. write& “post-
quam te aliquis reprehenderit.” He there-
fore probably had‘ quis is .’ ‘In breve te
eogi’ means that the book will be rolled
up and put into a case, and not taken out
again. The metaphorical language is kept
up in the following words, in ‘peccantis,’
and in the notion of being thrown aside
when the freshness of youth shall have
lest it.

9. Quodsi non odio peccantis] ‘But if
the prophet is not blinded by his aversion
to the offender,' that is, if l am not led
by my aversion to your wantonness to
prophesy too harshly of your fate. ‘Ae-
tas ' is used for any time os life according
to the context; but more frequently for

fild age than youth, which is the meaning
ere.

near the edge of the precipice, and he
drove him over in a passion. It is not
known where this fable comes from.
CompareA. P. (467),‘ ‘Invitum qui servat,
idem facit occidenti.’'

18. balba semotus] This keeps up the
image iu v. 10. Horace says his book win
be reduced in its old age to the poor
people' s schools in the back streets (S. i.
10. 75 ιι.). His writings soon took their
place with Homer and Virgil in all the
schools. Juvenal (vii 226) :—

[Ritter accepts Porphyrion' s explanation
that ‘balba senectus’ means ‘senes ma·
gistri: aud Ritter adds this reason, ‘ et
pronomine (te) et casu liber discretus est
a balba senectute ;' which is no reason]
