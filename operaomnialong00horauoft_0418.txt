Hinc nos Cocceii recipit plenissima villa
Quae super est Caudi cauponas.

45. Proxima Campano ponti] After
Sinuessa the Appia Via continued to take
a southerly directiou and crossed the Savo
(Savone) about three miles from that town,
and just within the box-ders of Campania.
That river was crossed by a bridge bearing
the name Pons Campanus, near which was
a small house erected for the accommoda-
tion of persons travelling on public busi-
ness, where there were officers appointed
to supply them with ordinary necessaries.

piariis praestantur haec iis qui rei publicae

passed the night.

47. Hinc muli Capuae] When it
reached the right bank of the Vulturnus,
four miles below the Savo, the Appia Via
turned, striking inland along that bank of
the river, which it crossed at the town of
Casilinum, where Hannibal met with stout
resistance from the Romans who garrisoned
it aster the battle of Cannae (Liv. xxiii. 17).
This is the site of the modern Capua.
About two miles farther on the road, which
now took a south-easterly direction, lay
Capua, on the site of which is the modern
village Santa Maria di Capoua. There
the party arrived ‘ betimes‚’—in time pro-
bably for dinner, after which meal Mae-
cenas and others of the party went to play
at bau, while Horace whose sight and
virgil whose digestion interfered with that
amusement. went early to bed. On the
mode of playing with the ‘ pila‚’ the stu-
dent will find all the information he re-
quires in Becker’s Gallus, ‘ Exc. on the
Gymnastic Exercises‚' and in Smith's Dict-
Ant„ art. ‘Pila.’ Virgil is said by Do·
natus (Vit. Virg. c. vi. § 19) to have had

uncertain health, aud to have suffered fre-
quently either from toothache‚ ⁴headache,
or complaints of the stomach.

50. Hine nos Coeoeii] The road, con-
tinuing in a south-east direction,
through two small Campanian towns, Ca-
latia (le Galazze) and Ad Novas (la Nova) ;
but the usual halting-place aster Capua
was the town of Caudium, which was the
first Samnite town on the Appia Via, and
was situated at the head of the pass called
the Furcae or Fauces Caudinae, celebrated
for the surprise and capture of the Roman
army by C. Pontius in the second Samnite
war, A.U.c. 433. The site of Caudium is
discussed in Dict. Geog. Cramer fixes it
at Paolisi or Cervinara, and mentions
(from Pratilli’s treatise on the Via Appia)
that near Montesarchio, in the neighbour-
hood, various inscriptions have been found,
in which the names of persons belonging
to the family of Cocceius occur. At Cau-
dium, Cocceius had a handsome house, and
Horace marks the situation by saying it
lay beyond the public tavern. For ‘Caudi’
all Cruquius' MSS. (and he had some of
the best) read ‘Claudi,’ and his Scholiast
has this note: “ quae est supra Claudii
cujusdam cauponas. Claudii cauponae
sive tabernae oppidum est Samnii non
procul a Benevento.'' But ‘Caudi' is, Ι
have no doubt, the right reading. The
town was twenty-one miles from Capua. -

51. Nunc mihi paneis] The scene that
follows represents a scurrilous contest be-
tween two parasites. The description be·
gius with an invocation of the Muse, aster
the fasbion of the epic poetis—an amusing
paicdy, with which Acron says some per·
sons of his day found fault ; and from
Orelli I find there are some who have done
so in our own. “Nimis profecto fasti-
diose,'' he says: “stulte” says the Scho-
liast, and most persons will agree with
him. The Scholiast on Juvenal, S. v. 3,
