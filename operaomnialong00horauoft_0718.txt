those advisers? If wealth could make a wise man and good, γοα would be ashamed if
any were richer than yonrself. If what a man pays for is his own, and there are some
things which become ours by possession, then your neighbonr’s farm which supplies you
with all γοα want is yours. What does it matter whether γοα paid for it yesterday or
long ago? If a man buys land, all he gets from it is bought, though he calls it allhis
own, and puts up bonndaries to mark it off, as if that could be one’s own which may
change hands in a moment. What is the nse of villas and barns if heir succeeds
heir as wave succeeds wave i> What are broad pastures to ns if death lays all low
alike? As for jewels and all fine things, there are some who have them not, but the
wise man cares not to have them. Why one man prefers his ease to the riches of
Herod, while his brother is slaving all day, their genius alone cantell, the eompanion
of their birth, their life, and their death, never the same, now fair, now ‹lm-k. 1
shall use my small means as I please, without fear of what my heir may say ς yet I
am not disposed to forget the difference between a eheerful liver and a profligate,
a frngal man and a miser. Itis one thing to squauder, another to spend it liberally,
to seek no more than you want, and to enjoy like the school-boys the short holiday
that is left you.

(v. 199.) “ Let me be free from the squalor of poverty‚ and Ι care not whether Ι 110

the foul wind of adversity does not accompany my course. I may be last of those

FLORE, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,
Si quis forte velit puerum tibi vendere natum

Tibure vel Gabiis, et tecum sic agat : “ Hic et
Candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos
Fiet eritque tuus nummorum millibus octo, 5

1. Flore, bono claroque] See Introduc-
tion, and as to the character of Tiberius,
Epp. i. 9. 4 n. Tiberius after his adop-
tion by Augustus, AJ). 4, became Tib.
Claudius Nero Caesar.

2. natum Tibure vel Gabiis] That is,
‘ any where you plesse? “ Poetis certa ima-
gine opns est ;'' the poets like to give reality
to their illustrations by being specific. This
is Dillenburger’s remark, and Ι agree with
him. Orelli thinks Italian towns are men-
tioned with reference to the fact of the
slave being a ‘ verna’ (Epod. ii. 65 11.).

As to Gabii, see Epp. i. 11. 7 11.

5. nemmem-um millibus· octo] About 65l.
sterling. Much lai-ger sums were given
for handsome slaves ; and this boy’s accom-
plishments, if they were real, would make
him worth a good price. There would bc
reason therefore to suspect in such a ease

that the owner was anxious to get rid of
him. (S. ii. ’1. 42 11.) The ‘ literati '
were a separate class in the slave family,
and were subdivided into ‘anagnostae ³ or
‘lectores’ (who read to their masterachiefly
at their meals, or if their masters were
authors they read their productioris aloud
for the benefit of the gaesa), and ⁸ librarii’
01 ‘seribae‚’ used for writing from dictation,
taking care of the librat-y, keeping accounts,
&c., and hence called ‘pueri' or ‘servi a stu—
diis: ‘ab epistolis‚' ‘a bibliotheca,’ ‘notai-ii?
&c. There were also architects, sculptor&
painters, engravers, and other artists‚ who
all came under the same general head of
‘ literati? The boy in this place might also
be put among the ‘ cantores’ or ‘ sympho-
niaci‚’ the choir or band who sang and
played to their master at menls. In short,
hc was fit for any of the above employments
