HORATII FLACCI

Contra sonantem Palladis aegida
Possent ruentes ⁶? Hinc avidus stetit
Volcanus, hinc matrona J uno et

Nunquam humeris positurus arcum,

60

Qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
Crines solutos, qui Lyciae tenet
Dumeta natalemque silvam,

Delius et Patareus Apollo.

Vis consili expers mole ruit sua:

65

Vim temperatam di quoque provehunt
In majus 5 idem odere vires
Omne nefas animo moventes
Testis mearum centimanus Gyas

Sententiarum, notus et integrae

Tentator Orion Dianae
Virginea domitus sagitta.

* legend assigns to the Aloidae. These vari·
ations are only worth noticing as they help
to show that the Romans set little value
by these stories, and only used them as
orna-ments of poetry 5 and to prevent stu-
dents from wasting their time with some
commentators in attempting to reconcile
statements which are not reconcileable.—
Typhoeus (Τυφωεύς) warred with Zeus on
his own account. Mimas and Rhoetus
were giants. Mimas was also the name of
a Centaur ; and the name of Rhoecus, who
was also a Centaur, has by some editors
been substituted for Rhoetus here and in
C. ii. 19. 23 n. Porphyrion and Ence-
ladus were of the same family.

ι 58. avidus] Blomfield (Gloss. Aesch.
P. V. 376) makes ‘avidus’ a mere orna-
mental epithet‚ so that ‘ avidus Vulcanus '
is like ⁶ ignis edax.' I think that ‘avidus'
means ‘ avidus pugnae,' as in Virg. (Aen.
xii. 430), “ Ille avidus pugnae suras iuclu-
serat auro.'' Tacitus puts the word abso-
lutely (Ann. i. 51), “ Caesar avidas legiones
quatuor in cuneos dispertit.’' In enume-
rating the principal gods who assisted Zeus
in the battle, Horace means that, although
they were present, it was Pallas to whom
the victory was mainly owing; otherwise
the force of his argument is lost. The
description of Apollo combines his various
places of abode, as Pindar does in Pyth. i.
39 sq„ which lines Hermann thinks a blot
on t‘he poem, Ι ‹lo not know why.

Λύκιε καὶ Δάλου ἀνάσσων Φοῖβε Παρνασοῦ
τε κράναν Κασταλίαν φιλέων

ἐθελήσαις ταῦτα νόῳ τιθέμεν.

‘ Lyciae dumeta ¹ are the woods about Pa-
tara, a town in Lycia, where Apollo passed
six months of the year as he passed the
other six at Delos (according to Servius on
Aen. iv. 144), which place Horace means
by ‘natalem silvam? i. e. the woods on
Mount Cynthus. Herodotus, speaking of
the similarit y in one particular of the wor-
ship of Belus at Babylon and Apollo 'at
Patara, alludes to this division of the god’s
presence (i. 182) ε Karia-’ep ἐν Πατάροισι
τῆς Λυκίης ἡ πρόμαντις τοῦ θεοῦ, ἐπεὰν
γένηται- οὐ γὰρ ὧν αἰεί ἐστι χρηστήριον·
αὐτόθι· ἐπεὰν δὲ ’γένηται κ.τ.λ.

’ [61. lavit] The form ‘ lavere ³ occurs
only in the Odes and Epodcs. In *the
Satires and Epistles Horace uses both
‘lavere ' and ‘ lavare? Ritten]

67. idem odere vires] This seems to
be taken from Euripides (Hel. 903), μισεῖ
’γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τὴν βῖαν. [‘ Vires’ means ‘ vio-
lent persons‚’ as Ritter well observes.
‘Vis' and ‘ vim ³ are abstracta] Respecting
the name ‘ Gyas‚’ see C. ii. 17. 14 n. ‘In-
teger ' is equivalent to ‘intactus,’ and in-
volves the same root (C. iii. 2. 18 n.). ‘Ten-
tator ³ is not elsewhere used for a seducor.
It is taken from the Greek πειρᾶν, which
'Timaeus (Lex. Platon.) explains thus: πει-
ρῶντα· πειράζοντα διὰ λόγων παῖδα ‘Pp-‘yv-
ναΐκα, where see Ruhnken’s note. Tibullus
uses the verb (i. 3. 73) :—

“ Illic J unonem tentare Ixionis ausi
Versantur celeri noxia membra rota.''

See Muretus onthis passage.
