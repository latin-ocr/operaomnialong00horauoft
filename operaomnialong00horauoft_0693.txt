Romulus et Liber pater et cum Castore Pollux, 5
Post ingentia facta deorum in templa recepti,

Dum terras hominumque colunt geum, aspera bella
Conponunt, agros assignant, oppida condunt,

Ploravere suis non respondere favorem

Speratum meritis.

Diram qui contudit hydram

lo

Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,
Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari.
Urit enim fulgore suo qui praegravat artes
Infra se positas3 exstinctus amabitur idem.

Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores,

‘Liber’ see lspp. i. 19. 4 ιι. Suetonius,
in his lifeofAugustus (c. ⁷), says, that
¹whm the question of his name was debated
smne would have had him called Romulus
aa the second founder of the city, but that
the judgment of Munatius Plancus pre-
vailed and he was called Augustus. Dion
candus (53.16) says he wished very much
to ha called Romulus, but was afraid peo-
&geum think he was aiming at being
and therefore took the name of Au-
Dion' s stories ofthis sort are not
always to be trusted, and this is no doubt
untrue. A had too much sense to
desire such aname as Romulus. The four
here named were the favourite heroes of
the Greeks, who attributed chiefly to their
’ hbonrs the civilization of the world. of

‚“ Virtutem ineolumem odimus,
Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi?

In Q. Curtius’ history of Alexander (viii.
5. 8), the author, speaking of bis flatterers,
says: “ Hi tum caelum illi aperiebant ς
Herculem et Patrem Liberum et cum Pol-
111oe Castorem novo numiui cessuros esse
jactabant? 'and one of them named cleo, a
Siciliau. “merita percensuit, quibus uno
modo referri gratia posset, si quem intelli-
gerent Deum esseconfiterentur. —Nec Her-

tium invidiam? Either Curtius copied
Horace or there was some book which both
imitated.

13. Urit enim fulgore suo] ‘For that
man scorches with his brightnoes who over·
powers capacities inferior to his own. 'that
is, inferior minds are galled by the cou-
sciousness of their inferiority, aud extin-
guished by his greatness. ‘’Artes here
means attainments or powers of any kind.

15. Praesenti tibi maturos] See note
ouC.iv..,529andC.iii..51.-

-“ Caelo tonantem credidimus J ovem
Regnare: praesens divus habebitur
Augustus.’'

Suetonius says of Augustus: “ Templa
quamvis sciret etiam proconsulibus decerni
solere, in nulla tamen provintia nisi com-
muni suo Romanoque nominc recepit. Nam
in urbe quidem pertinacissime abstinuit
hoc honore, atque etiam argenteas statuas
olim sibi positas conflavit omnes ’' (c. 52).
Among the coins represented in Patini’ s
notes on Suetonius (Burmann sed. Tab. xi)
is oue of silver, which he oalls“ rarissimus
maximi moduli ’nummusf ’and on the re-
verse of which is a temple with the inscrip-
tion “ Bou. m· Ave? The date is A.U.c.
735. (Compare the inscription with Clin-
ton' s F. H. for that year.) From the words

‘conL ASL' ’(Commune Asiae) it may have
been the tem ple of Pergamum alluded to
by Tiberius iu his speech to the senate
when he declined a similar honour offered ν
to him in Spain. (Tac. Anu. iv. 37.)
is also mentioned by Dion Cass. (51. 20),
together with one in Nicomedia (Bithynia).
See also Aun- iv. 55. But a temple m the
provinces was an honour which, as Sueto-
nius says, aud as appears from Cicero’ s let-
tem, from coins, and other sources, the
governors osten enjoyed. Josephus meu-
