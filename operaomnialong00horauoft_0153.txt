CARMEN XIV.

If Postumus be‘ ιιι this instance a real name, Horace’ s friend may have been the per-

'· 'ſs m to whom Pmpertius wrote a beautiful elegy (iii. 12) on the occasion of his going, as
.= Inbue! supposes, with the unfortunate expedition of Aelius Gallus against the Arabians,
J though tham· ιι no resemblance between the ode and the elegy‚ unless it may be traced
‘in nume· ‘placens uxor' (v. 21). Propertius reproaches Postumus for leaving his

· ·1 mate wife Galla, whose fidelity he compares with that of Penelope. Estre sup·

>21 pm it likely that this Postumus is he who A. 1). 5 was consul suffectus, and A. Ι). 10

s triunphat! for his victories over the Dalmatians. This was Postumus Vibius. But it is
› dlvoeyuncerhin. The odeis clearly one of those towhich any other name might have

“, hm pdxed, since it only deals with Horace’ s ordinary commonphce, the certainty of

⁷ ι anth-fln- all men. The tone is rather more melancholy than usual. Jani chooses to

3'n1112oee that Postumus was rich, but covetous and wlf—indulgent, afraid of death, and
Ἰ· vint) nrfful of his health. Dacier supposes Postumus to be no other than Julius Florus,
fithom the third epistle of the first book and second of the second book are ad-

* ” Μ. The Julian family, he says, frequently bore this sumame, and the qualities

 

ι saw...

'which Emace assigns to the one he assigns also to the other, those qualities being am-

.- Ι 1101-oe does not in reality charge these vices upon either of his friends, as will be

tudily seen by an attentive reader, they cannot be identified by this compar-ison. The
duta d this odeis as uncertain as the person, though Jani, from its sombre tone, sup-
poses it must have been written late.

ARGUMEN T.

'fitne’ is slipping away, Postumus, and piety will not retard the approach of age or
· dmth. No sacrifices will propitiam Pluto, who keeps even the giants Geryon and

'fityoe beyond that stream which all must croSS, even though we expose not ourselves
’ nothe dangers of war, the sea, and climate. Thou must leave home, wife, and all
* ΗΜ haut behind, and thine heir will squander what thou hast boarded.
