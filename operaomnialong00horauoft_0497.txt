SATIRARUM 11. 3. 461

andi-dar tothe vdoeof wax-ning- You, Damasippus, have a madness for buying
oldatatues. But iathemanwhotrustayouless mad? 1f1 were to begyou
to accept a mant from me, would you 110 mad if you accepted it, or not rather mad
it you refused yourgood luck Ρ ‘ This raseal, get what security you will from him,
tia 111111 fist 111 a thousand knots, like Proteus 110 will still get out of them ;' but,

(v. ⁹1⁷.) “ come listen to me, ye ambitious, ye avaricious, ye luxurious, ye superstitious,
andlwillproveyouallwbemad.

(v. 82.) “The avaricious are the worst‚ almost past cure. Staberius would have the
amount of 1113 fortune engraved upon his tomb. Why ἰ’ Because 110 believed poverty
to 110 the greatest possible disgraoe; and if he had been dying an as poorer, he would
have considered himself a worse man in that proportion: he thought that virtue,
sume, every thing gave way to wealth, and that its possessor was noble, brave, and
just. What, wisetoo? Ay, anda kingtoboot or any thing else. ‘But which 13
most mad (say you), Staberius or Aristippus, who to lighten his slave's sack bade
him thmw away some of the money that was in it? ² It does not help one moot
point to raiae mother. A man that should buy a quantity of musical instrumenta
who knew nothing of music, awls and lasts who was no shoemaker, sails who was no
baden-all would say he was mad. Is he less mad who gets money together which
he known not how or fears to use ἲ Δ man who watches over his heap of corn bnt
eats only bitter herbs, who has his cellar full of the beet wine and drinks only sour,
hand-ome bed-clothes in his chest and sleeps upon straw, he is not ealled mad, only
because it 13 the madness of so many. Are you keepingall this for your heir to
aquander, old fool ἓ or for sear you should come to want Ρ How much would it take
from you to put a drop of better oil to your 0111111380, or to clean your dirty head Ρ
What do you lie, steal, rob for, if so ufflE is enough for you i’ What, are γοα sane ἰ’
Ifyou began to throw stones, every one would call γοα mad; but γοα may strangle
your wife, or poison your mother, and γοα are all right, because γοα are 110 Orestes
of Argos but a gentleman of Rome. But was not Orestes mad before he betrayed
it by murdering his mother ἲ And aster that he did nothing worse than yourself.
Opimius the miser was sick. and nigh unto death. His heir was exulting in the
pospect of succession. His physician however had his money—baga brought ont and
emptied before him, and set people to count the contenta. This roused his patient.
'l'heu says the doctor, ⁴ If you don’t take care, your heir will earry off all your
money? ‘ What, before Ι 11111 dead Ρ ' ‘ Well, then, get up: take some ηοω-1311111001,
or you’ll die. Come, take some broth.' ‘ How much did it eost? ’ ‘ Oh not much?
‘ But how much Ρ ’ ‘ Eight asses? ιΔ1113, alas! what difference does it make
whether Ι die of disease or robbery ?' Who then 13 sane Ρ He who is not a sool.
But the eovetous? He is a fool, and insane. But if a man is not covetous is he
sane i> No. A man may be siek though he has not the beart-burn. A man may
not 110 a Μαι-01· or a miser, for which he may be thankfu1; but if he is ambitious
and headstrong, let him go to Anticyra.

(v. 166.) “ It makes no differenee whether you throw away your money or forbear to
nse it. -One Servius Oppidius had two famis, which he gave one to each of his two
sons, and 011 his death-bed he ealled them to him and said: ‘ 1 have watched you,
my sons, one thr-owing or giving away his toy& the other hiding them in holoe. Take
heed loet'you fall under opposite follies : do you beware of diminishing, and you of
inmensing, the fortune 1 leave you. 1 cantion γοα both against the temptations of
ambition. My curse be upon you if you ever aim at public offices. Yon may 110
mpted to ruin yourselves for popularity‚ aping the munificenoe of Agrippa as the
fox might ape the lion-³
