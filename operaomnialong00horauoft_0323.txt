Interminato cum semel fixae cibo
Intabuissent papulae. 40
Νοιι defuisse masculae libidinis
Ariminensem Foliam
Et otiosa credidit Neapolis
Et omne vicinum oppidum,
Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala <13
Lunamque caelo deripit.
Hic irresectum saeva dente livido

Canidia rodens pollicem
Quid dixit aut quid tacuit ¹? O rebus meis
Non infideles arbitrae, 50
Nox et Diana quae silentium reg-is

Arcana cum fiunt saera,

Nunc, nunc adeste, nunc in hostiles domos
Iram atque numen vertite!

Formidolosis dum latent silvis ferae 55
Dulci sopore languidae,

Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum
Latrent Suburanae canes
