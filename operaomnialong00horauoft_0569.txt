93. Pausiaca torpes, Inane, tabella] --
Pausias was a native of Sicyon, oue of the
most celebrated schools of art, where there
was a collection of his pietures.
Hany were sold by the Sicyonian govern-

ἵ .. ment ω pay their debts, and most of them

found their way to Rome. A very large

to Rome by Scaurus when he was
aedile, and at the time Horace wrote was
kept in the portic-usos Cn. Pompeius. 'Ibe
lietures- of Pausias however were chiefly
mn, ‘ tabellae‚' and among the most cele-
brated was the porti-ait of his mistress
Glycera as a flower girl, Στεφανήτλοκος
(Plin. N. Η. lib. xxxv. c. 11, sect. 40),
“ parvas pingebat tabellas maximeque pue-
ros ;’ but Pausias was also celebrated for his

96. Fulvi Rutubaeque aut Pacideiani]
These are all names of gladiators, as we
may guther from the context. Pliny tells
ua it was the practice, when shows of gla-
anton wenc exhibssed, for the exhibitor to
not forth a picture of the games, to inform

the public, such as we see now of oonjumrs,
and the like; and these are the pictures
Davus allodes to. They were done no doubt
roughly, as he describes. “ Pingi autem
gladiatoria munera atque in publico exponi
coepta a C. Terentio Lucano ” (Plin. xxxv.
c. 7, ξ 43). Cicero mentions a gladiator
named Pacideianus, and he quotes the fol·
lowing lines of Lucilius :—

“ Non spurcus homo sed doctus et acer
Cum Pacideiano hic componitur, optimus
Posiaonlazmjpae natos [gladiator qui fuit

unus .

(De opt. Gen-Orat. c. vi. See also Tusc-
Disp. iv. 21, aud Ep. ad. Qu. Fr. iii. 4.)
Horace may have taken the name sor any
gladiator in consequence of the celebrity of
this man. [Ritter says: ‘⁸ ‘ pacidiani’ unus
Blandiuius.” ’κ Placideiani ' or ‘ Placi-
diani’ isthe true reading] Some of the
old editions have ‘placide Janiff Fea re·
fers to an inscription in Gruter‘s collec-
tion (p. 301), in which the name Placidia-
nus occurs, and he adopts that orthogra-
phy. ‘ Contento poplite ' represents the
attitude of the gladiators. The Scholiasta
raise a doubt upon the point, thinking t-he
words may apply to the spectator stretch-
ing himself on tip—toeto get a neas-er view.
[But there is nothing of this tip-toe in the
words. ‘ Contento poplite ’ cau only apply
to the spectator, who stands staring at the
pictures long enough to tine his hams]
