in the followingwa wa‚y ‘⁶ eleganter, quasi

tores dietum? Authors had slaves, called
‘pueri a studiis: or generally ‘ librarii,' to
whom they dictated. See S. 4. 10. Epp-

7i. 10. 49. The notiou of this Scholiast is,

tliat Horace extemporized this anathema
against Demetrius and Tigellius and then
told his amanuensis to go before he forgot
it and add it to the Satire as his ‘subscrip-
tio ;’ which in letters was the word ‘ vale‚’
or something civil of that sort. This in-
terpretation may be admitted without dis-
turbing the notion that ‘libellus ' signifies
the whole book including these teu Satires,
though it might equally suit the present
one. See Pers. i. 120. 1 think ‘ sub-
scribe ' has the meaning above given, and
am inclined to take ‘libello' for the Satire,
not the book, which Orelli and Dillenbr.
take it to mean, following Bentley, who
takes that meaning for granted. The
editors are divided; Heindorf, Gesner,
