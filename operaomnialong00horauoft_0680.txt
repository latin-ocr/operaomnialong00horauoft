EPISTLE XIX.

It would appear that Horace had imitators among those who abused him ; and if
we are to understand him to mean what he says, there were those who took his eon-
vivial odes literally, and, roupling them with the example of the old Greek poete, con-
ceived that the way to write verses was to propitiate Bacchus and drink a great deal
of wine. But perhaps he only means that they took to writing in the same strain all
about wine and driving dull care away, and so for:h‚ which at second hand would be
very poor stuff. Such servile imitators he speaks of with great disgust ; and, while 118
exposes their shallowness‚ he accounts for their malevolence towards himself by the
fact of his not having sought their company or hired their applause. He at the same
time claims to have been the first to dress the ly ric measures in the Latin language
while he defends himself for having adopted the metres of another by pointing to the
examples 01 Sappho and Alcaeus, and takes credit for having avoided the virulence of

Archilochus while he imitated his verse. This is introduced by the way, the chief ·

purpose of the Epistle being to show the folly of his calumniators and the cause of
their abuse.

There is no allusion to any of his poems but the Epodes and Odes ς the publication
os the latter probably brought out the imitations and the abuse referred to, and 1
think it probable that this Epistle was written at no great distance of time aster that
publication. Franke gives A.U.c. 734 for the date. I should be inclined for the above
reason to put it a year or two earlier.
