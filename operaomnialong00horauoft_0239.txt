tiful. Bentley, with a want of taste for
which he appears to me pre-eminent
among critica, objects to ‘exsomnis‚' for
why should Bacchants be sleepless 1> Do
they not sometimes sleep Ρ See what
Euripides says (Bacch. 682), εὗδον δὲ
πᾶσαι σάμασιν παρειμέναι : therefore
‘Edonis’ not ‘exsomnis‚’ is what Horace
wrote. But if they sometimes sleep they
probably sometimes are kept awake, and
so Horace represents one of them here.
And ‘exsomnis’ is not the mere orna-

has some little MS. authority.
has ‘aeque ut’ (C. i. 16. 7-9), and other
writers have ‘ pariter ut‚’ ‘ non minus ut'
(Prop. i. 15. 7), ‘perinde ut: which are
not the same certainly as ‘non secus ut.’

stance, but I believe ‘ ut' to be the read-
ing here and to be used in preference to
⁸ ae‚’ because that word occurs in the line
before. Some would put a full stop before
‘nt,’ and make it a particle of exclama-
tion [and this is certainly the more in-
telligible punctuation . . . ‘ Ut—libet ’ will
then ba like ‘ut melius' ἀφ, C. i. 11. 3].
But the Scholiasts did not understand it
so.

celebrating the orgies of Bacchus. For
‘ ripas,' which has the best authority, and
that of all his own MSS. (a few others
have ⁸ rupes‚' which Lambinus adopts,
but it seems to have come from C. ii.
19. 1: ‘¹ Bacchum in remotis earmina
rupibus '’) Bentley reads ‘rivos‚' which
has no authority at all, both here and at
iv. 2. 31, saying that ‘ ripas' cannot stand
alone without the name of a river, which
assertion is not correct. See, for instance,
C. iii. 1. 23: “Fastidit umbrosamque

Pil? Naiadum potens Baccharumque]
These are the Nympha mentioned C. ii.
19. 3. Horace, in his description of the
strength of the Nymphs (Dryads), had
perhaps in his mind Euripidoe' description
(Bacch. 1109) :—

αἴ δὲ μυρίαν χέρα
προσέθεσαν ἐλάτῃ κάξανέσπασαν χθονός.

For ‘ Ο Lenaee5 sequi deum‚’ Bentley
proposes ‘Te‚ Lenaee, sequi ducem,’ say-
ing there is ambiguity in the sentence
as it stands, as to whether ‘cingentem’
applies to the follower or the god. But
the ambiguity is not removed by his
emendation, and Horace sufficiently ex-
plains his own meaning in C. iv. 8. 33 ε

“ Ornatus viridi tempora pampino Liber.”

GARMEN XXVI.

This ode represents a mecamffil gallant's first refusal, and his mortification and
'rath at his defeat. To apply it to Horace, or to assume from the opening, as Franke
does (following the Scholiasts) that he was getting into ysare, and about to ahandon
lyrie poetry, or that Chloe is “ illa haud dubie de qua i. 23 ; iii. 9. 9,'’ or any other
Chloe whatever, is to mistake the character and scope of the ode, in my opinion. Π
any of Horaee’s compositions are purely fanciful, this may be pronoun'oed to be so.
