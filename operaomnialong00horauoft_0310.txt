HORA'PII FLACCI

ARGUMENT.

Happy is the man who lives on his farm remote from the troubles of the city and the
dangers of war and of the sea. He trains his vines, or watches his flocks, or 'grafts
his trees, or stores his honey, or shears his sheep, or brings offex-inge of fruit to
Priapus and Silvanus, or lies in the shade or on the soft grass where birds are singing
and streams are murmuring; or hunts the boat, or lays nets for the birds and hares,
and herein forgets the pangs of love. Give me a chaste wife who shall care for my
home and children, milk my goats, prepare my unbought meal, and no dainties shall
please me like my country fare, as I sit and watch the kine and oxen and labourers

coming home to their rest at even. So said Alphius the usurer, and determining to
live in the country 116 got in all his money, but soon repented, and put it out to

usury again.

BEATUS ille qui procul negotiis,
Ut prisca gens mortalium,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,

Solutus omni fenore,

Neque excitatur classico miles truci, 5
Neque horret iratum mare,
Forumque vitat et superba civium

Potentiorum limina.

Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
Altas maritat popuIOS, -

ΙΟ

Α111 111 reducta valle mugientium
Prospectat errantes gregeS‚
Inutilesque falce ramos amputans

Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,

15

Aut tondet infirmas oves ς
Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit, ·

[1. negotiis] Hence ‘negotiator,' a
banker or money-lenden]

4. Solutus omni fenore] Torrentius,
whom Orelli follows, explains this ‘qui
neque dat neque accipit fenori,' and this
would be the meaning 111 1116 mouth of a
city usurer. But the words would equally
suit any other person, and would mean
that in the country he would not 116 subject
to the calls of creditors‚ and need not get
into debt. Some parts of the lang-uage
suit and some do not suit the character of
Al hius.

g. Ergo] This is an adverb of empha-
sis, like δή, 1116 use of which it is not easy
to detine. Here it expresses a feeling of
plcasure in the contemplation of the soenes
described. In the occupations and amuse-
ments that follow no particular order of

seasons is observed‚ but one recreation aster
another is mentioned as it occurs, which is
a more poetical way of proceeding than some
editors would adopt, who have altered the
arrangement of the verses to suit the sea-
sons.

[10. maritat] ‘Makes the poplars hus-
bands.' ‘ Ulmi vitibus recte maritantur?
where ‘ vitibus ' is the ablative 3 Colum. xi.
2. 79. ‘ Si teneram ulmum maritaveris,’
Colum. v. 6. 18. See C. iv. 5. 30.]

[15. mella] The plural as usual in
Horace, C. iii. 16. 33 dcc. See C. iii. 19. 8n.]

16. infirmas] An ornament-al epithet,
not ‘ sickly,’ as Baxter thinks.

17. Vel cum] The commentatore quote
Aen. xi. 406: “Vel cum se pavidum con-
tra mea jurgia fingit‚” &c.‚ and Wagner's
note, “ Vel sic usurpatum eam habet poten·
