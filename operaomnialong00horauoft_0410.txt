him, and properly joins ‘an ' with ‘addu-
bites' ‘Avidos' signifies intemperate, as
in C. i. 18. 11. [‘ F actu :³ Ritter has ‘ fac-

129]. Ex hoe eyo sanus] Horace says
that owing to his father’ s training (ex hoc)
he had been kept m a sound and healthy
state, and preserved from those vices which
in their worst form bring destruction, but
which in a moderate degree may be over-
looked. He implies that in this venial form
he is liable to these faults ; but even from
that smaller measure time, the candour of
friends, and reflection, will deduct a good
deal. The sentence is a little irregular,
but sufficiently intelligible. ‘ Consilium

bent upon correctiug the errors of, it. This
sort of reflection a man may pursue‚ if he
be in earnest, either as he lies on his bed
(S. 6. 122 n.), oras he walks abroad, alone
among crowds. By ‘ porticus ’ Horace
means any one of the public porticoes,
covered walks, of which there was a great
number at Rome, and which were usually
crowded by those who resorted thither for
exercise‚ conversation, or business.

139. Illudo chartis] Forcell. interprets
this as if it meant, ‘I amuse myself with

writing,’ and quotes S. ii. 8. 62 ε “ Ut
semper gaudes illudere rebus Humanis !’'
It means, ‘I put it down in my notes by
way of amusement? As to ‘chax-tae? see
S. ii. 3. 2 11.

141. Multa poetarum veniat manus]
Against a large number of MSS. and the
common usage of the language Orelli 111-
sists upon reading ‘ veniet? Though Ho-
race in his odes uses the construction with
the subjunctive. in the first clause, and
future in the second (C. iii. 3. 7), he is
not likely to have done it here. Bentley
edits ‘noles' and ‘veniet. ’‚—Horace in
winding up his discourse, stops the lips of
his opponents with a sally of good humour,
which they would find it hard ·to resist.
He says if they will not make allowance for
this little sin of his (that of taking notes of
his neighbours' vices), he will brin a host
of sinners (poets) as bad as himse ‚ and,
like the proselytizing Jews, they will attack
them till they have made conver-ts and
poets of them all. ‘ Multo plures sumus’
means ‘ there are many besides me.' [On
the proselytism of the Jews Ritter quotes
Tacit. Hist. v. 5, and Cicero, Pro Flacco,
c. 28. The passage from Cicero shows
that the Jews were numerous at Rome in*
Cicero's time, and that some of them knew
how to make mouey.]
