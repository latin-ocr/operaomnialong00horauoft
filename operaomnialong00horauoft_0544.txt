According to Suetonius (Nero, c. 17) in the
time of Nero provision was made “ut in
testamentis primae duae 00100, testatorum
modo nomine inscripto, vacuae signaturis
offenderentur? the object being that the
witnesses who attested the signature of the
testator might not become acquainted with
the names of the ‘heredes’ which would

appear in the two first ‘cerae.’' ‘ Solus
'heres' would be called ‘heres ex asse ,·' if
there were several ‘ heredes ’ they would be
‘ heres ' ‘ ex dodrante: ‘ ex quadrante? &c.‚
according to 1110 proportion of the estate
given 10 00011, which was described by the
different divisions of the as.

55. Plerumque recoctus scriba ex quin-
queviro] ‘Plerumque' is used by Horace
in the tense of ‘ interdum' here and else-
where. (See A. P. v. 14 and 95.) For-
cellini only gives examples of this meaning
from later writers. Τ110 ‘ scribae: of whom
an example occurs above (S. i. 5. 35), were
clerks in public offices. These places were
often got by purchase, and the ‘scriba’
received public pay. Nevertheless the
‘ quinqueviri ’ appear from this passage to
have ranked lower than the ‘ scribae 3' and
Cicero speaks rather contemptuously of the
office 10 1115 Acad. Prior. ii. 44. They were
officers appointed to relieve the other ma-
gistrates at night of the charge of the city.
These were the permanent ‘ quinqueviri ;' but
extraordinary commissions of five were osten

variously given. T‘iie Scholiasta Acron and
Comm. Cruq. make it equivalent to ‘ astu·
tus‚’ ‘vafer :' “saepe refectus et per hoc
astutus? Porphyrion says it is “iterum
scriba factus,'’ as if the man had been a
‘ scriba‚' had become a ‘quinquevir‚’ and
had returned to 1115 former condition again.
Some editors take it as Acron does, though

his sense Ι think 15 only suggested by the
context. Others (as Lambinus) follow
Porph. What the exact force of Horace's
description is Ι do not 500, whether we take
‘ recoctus ' in the sense of the last Schol7
iast, or suppose it only to mean, as it may,
one who having been a ‘ quinquevir' has
been transformed into a ‘ scriba? Perhaps
Tiresias means to say that Coranus, who
had got into a situation in which 110 had
acquired a good deal of money and some
knowledge of business, saw through the at-
tentions of the fortune-hunter and laughed
01 him. The ‘corvus hians’ is perhaps
taken from Aesop’s fable of the fox and
crow, copied by Phaedrus (i. 13).

57. Captator] This word, as ‘captare
above (v. 23), is used by J uvenalmvenss
times for this character: another word
used in the same sense was ‘heredipetass
whether by any classical author besides
Petronius I do not know. We know no-
thing more of the actors in this sto ,
Nasica and Coranus, but it appears lik y
{hey were living persons and the ease well

nown.

58. Numsuaeis] Ulysses does not under·
stand him, and asks if he is frenzied, 05
prophets were when inspired.

59. aut erit aut non] This 15 taken by
some to be an ironical διλινγίας that is, it
may be taken as if Tiresias meant that
whatever he said was going 1ο happen
would happen, and vice versa 3 whereas he
may mean 10 say that there is no certainty
about the issue of the prophecies‚—they
will happen or will not, and he does not
know which. Ι 001 not sure about the
double meaning, and rather think Horace
only meant to put a pompous truism into
the mouth of the prophet.
