SATIRE VIII.

On the outside of the city walls, in front of Mons Esquilinus lay the Campus Esqui-
linus in which was a public burial-ground for the poorest of the people, and the place
of execution for slaves and others of the lower sort, whooe bodies were lefl: unburied for
the dog! and vultures to prey upon (Epod. v. 100). This place, which must always
have been a public nuisance and a source of malaria, was given (as some say) by a deci-ee

ottho moewnaoeenas, orelsepurchasedby him‚cleared‚ drained, and laid outin -

Μαι, ἱιι which lie asterwards built a handsomc house (C. iii. 29. Epod. ix„ xiv.
Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). His example was aflerwards followed by a member of
the house of Lamia, in whose gai-dens Caligula was buried (Suet. caliga. 59). The
mowingSatirewnssuggestedbynfigureofPriapussetupinMaeoeuas’garden. The
godis represented as contmsting the present state of the ground with what it once was,
by which a compliment is conveyed to Maecenas for his public spirit in ridding the
city of such a nuisance. Priapus also complains of the trouble he has in keeping the
ground clear of trespassers, but more particularly of the witchea who, having formerly
carried on their practices among the tombs and bones of the dead, continued to haunt
the scene of their iniquity.. This is introduced for the purpose of dragging in the
woman whom Horace satirized under the name of Canidia. The description is in some
⁷ parts very like that of the fifth Epode, aud the tw0 may have been written about the
same time. It is not very likely Horace would have maintained his warfare with this
woman, whoever she was or whatever her offence, for several years. Kirchner (Qu.
Hor.p. 16).me in S. ii. 3. 312 reference is made to Maecenas as engaged in build-
ing, places these two Satires in consecutive years, this being written A.U.c. '721 (Intro-
duction to Epod. v.). But there is not much in this argument. The dearing, drain-
ing, and enclosing of the ground must have taken some time, and it may have
been several years before it was fit for living on, and no reference is made to a house in
this Satire. Pranke places it in amne. 718. There is very little clue to the date.

Onm truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,
Cum faber incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum,

[l. ] The adjective, as Ritter mpiryer’ ἂμαλλόδεται τὰ δράγματα, μὴ
remar is not formed directly from παριών τις

do not know if it is found. Ritter also
observes that there is both ¹ ficulnus ' and
‘ficulneas ’ as ‘ilignus ’ and ‘iligneus.]
— inutile liquam] The uselessness of
the wood of the fig-tree was proverbial.

Hence σύκιυοι ἄνδρες meant men fit for
nothing. See Theoc. x. 44 :—
