EPISTOLARUM Ι. 18. 637

(v. 67.) 'Pake care what you say of others, and to whom you say it. The inquisitive is
a babblen avoid him: ho will repeat what you say, and once said it cannot be re-
cnlled. cast not a longiug eye ou your patron’s slaves. He may put you off with
ono υ a present iu satisfaction of your claims, or he may be churlish about it aud
annoy you. 'l'ake cai-e whom you introduce, for γοα may be brought to shame by the
finlt· of another. lf γοα have ever found a man deceive you, get rid of him, and
keep your influence for those who are falsely maligned, sor may not the same come
upon yourself Ρ Your house is in danger when your neighbour’s is on fire, and γοα
lud better get the flre under iu the beginning.

(v. 86.) These who have never tried it think attendance on the great a mighty
plaannt thing. He who has is afraid of it. But as you are embarked take these
hints for your guidance. The light-liearted like not the solemn, nor the active the
slothful, nor the slothful the active, nor the drinkers the sober. Put the cloud from
your brow: the modest is liable to be counted reserved, and the silent sour. And
witha-l study wise books and learn the secrets of a quiet life, and to examine your
own conditiou; leam the sources of virtue, the reliefs of sorrow, the means of seif-
contentment, aud innocent tranquillity.

(v. 104.) When Ι retire to refrcsh myself by my own cool stream, what, think you, are
my reflections and my desires Ρ That Ι may get no more than l have, that I may
live for myself, with a good stock of books and a well-stored barn, aud a mind calm
and steady. Nay, but this 1 will make for myself; for the rest 1 will pray to Jove,
for they are all that he cau give or take away.

SI bene ’ω novi metues, liberrime Lolli,
Scurrantis speciem praebere professus amicum.
Ut matrona meretrici dispar erit atque
Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.
Est huie diversum vitio vitium prope majuS, 5
Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,
Quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atris,
Dum vult libertas dici mera veraque virtus.
· ⁷ Virtus est medinmvitiorum et utrinque reductum.
Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi ’ 10
Derisor lecti sic nutum divitis horret,
Sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit,
