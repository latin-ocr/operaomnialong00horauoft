HORATII FLACCI

Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina ; verum
Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur, et ultro,
Si taceas, laudant quidquid scripsere beati.

At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema

Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti ;

110

Audebit quaecunque parum splendoris habebunt
Et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna ferentur
Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant
Et versentur adhuc intra penetralia Vestae.

Obscurata diu populo bonus eruet atque

115

Profer-et in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum, Α
Quae priscis memorata Catonibus atque Cethegis
Nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas3
Adsciscet nova quae genitor produxerit usus.

Vehemens et liquidus puroque simillimus amni

120

Fundet opes Latiumque beabit divite lingua ;
Luxuriantia compescet, nimis aspera sano

, should stop his ears, and they might recite

without sear of reprisals. Compare “Ano-
bilium scriptorum auditor et ultor,’' Epp.
i. 19. 39 11.

[107. et ultro] ‘And further; they praise
whatever they have written, lucky fellows3'
that is self-sat-isfied.] “

113. Verba movere loco] The notion of
the censor is kept up. S. i. 6. 20 n.

114. Et versentur adhuc] This is away
os saying that the verses, though they may
be expunged, still are kept in the author's
desk, because he has a. regard for them and
cannot make up his mind to destroy them.
Porphyrion explains ‘penetralia Vestae '
thus z “ Id est, domi3 per quam metapho-
ram ostendit, quae in animo nostro fixa
versentur, tamen excludenda esse.” The
sauctuary of Vesta could only be entered
by her own priestesses.

116. speciosa vocabula rerum] ‘Expres-
sive terms ;' words which make themselves
intelligible at once: “quae prima specie
probantur” (Forcell.). So in A. P. 319 a
play is said to be ‘speciosa locis,' that is
‘ plain in its points,' its common-places or
sentiments clearly put.

117. Catonibus atque cethegis] As to
the use of the plural see S. i. 7. 8 11. M.
Porcius Cato Censorius was born about
A.u.o. 520, and was therefore contemporary
with Ennius, with whom he is associated,
A. P. 56, as successfully importing new
words into the language. Fragments
remain of his treatise de Re Rustica,

embraciug a varIety of instructions on
husbandry and subjects connected with
domestic economy 3 and of his Origines,
an account of the early history of Italy.
There are also fragments of his numerous
orations, which Cicero appears to have
studied (Brutus, c. 17). He had the high-
est opinion of Cato, and complains that he
was not studied enough even in his day,
adding “ refertae sunt orationes et verbis
et rebus illustribus—omnes oratoriae vir-
tutes in eis reperientur. Jam vero Ori-
gines ejus quem florem aut quod lumen
eloquentiae non habent ?” Μ. Cornelius
Cethegus was older than Cato, since he was
curule aedile when Cato was no more than
twenty. His eloquence was such that
Ennius called Cethegus “ Suadae medulla,
orator suaviloquenti ore '’ (Cic. Brut. c. 155
Cat. Maj. c. 143 see Epp. i. 6. 38 n.). But
it does not appear that any of his orations
were extant in Cicero’s time, for he only
mentions them on the authority of Ennius
who had heard him speak. His reputation
was sufficient at the time Horace wrote for
him to name him twice as an authority on
the language (A. P. 50 n.).

119. quae genitor produxerit usas]
‘Usus ' is ‘ eustom: which has always been
the parent of novelties in language. Com-
pare A. P. 70.

120. Vehemens] The two first syllables
are pronounced as one. S. i. 5. 67 : ‘⁴ Ni-
hilo deterius dominae jus esse.'’ [Ritter
and Kriigcr write ‘ vemens.'] .
