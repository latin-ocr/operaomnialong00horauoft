12. Emoenmspatus] “ ‘ Mancipatio’ is
the form by which a person who was not
‘sui juris’ was transferred to the ‘ potes-
tas’ of another, as in the case of adoption.
‘Emancipare’ is the proper term to ex-
press the making a person ‘ sui juris' by
the act of‘ mancipatio ;' but ‘mancipo
and‘ emaucipo’ are often confounded in
Α the MSSJ’ (Long’s note on Cic. de Se-
nect. c. xi. “Si nemini mancipata est.'’)
See also, by the same author, art. ‘Man-
cipium,’ Smith' s Dict. Ant. 1f ‘emanci-
patus’ is the true reading, it can only
signify ‘sold into slavery.’ The instances
quoted by Orelli from Plautus (Bacchid.
i. 1. 59), “ tibi me emancipo‚’' and Cicero
(Phil. ii. 21), “venditum atque emanci-
patum tribunatum‚’' are suspicious: in
each case ‘emancipo’ follows a word whose
last letter is ‘e.' [One MS. of Cicero
(Phil. ii. 21) 1198 ‘mancipatum‚' and it is
the proper word.]

16. compium] A gauze musquito cur-
tain. Some MSS. have ‘ conopeum‚’ and
so Lambinus and Cruquius. The Greek is
κωνωπεῖον, and according to analogy it
would be written κωνώπων if the Romans
-wished to shorten the penult, as κηρύκειον,
κηρύκιον, dre„ on which grounds Bentley
says that it should be written ‘ conopium '
or ‘ conopenm‚’ according as the penult is
short or long. It is long in Juvenal (Sat.
vi. 80): “ Ut testudineo tibi, Lentule,
eonopeo.’' In Propert. (iii. 11. 45) it is
short. “Foedaque Tarpeio conopia ten-
dere saxo-³ [Ritter puts 9 comma aster

¹,arma 'by which mode of reading the line
‘miles’ is attached to‘ spadonibus, and
the passage is more effective. In a useful
note he shows that Horace often places
‘ et' in this manner, as ‘ blandum et ’ C. 1.
12. 11, &a In order to get rid of the ‘e'

in ‘emancipatus ' I propose ‘ et mancipatus

feminae fert arma‚’ ‘a Roman both en-
slaved to a woman carries arms, and as a
soldier obeys eunuehs?

1'7. At huc] The SS. vary so much
that the true reading is very difficult to
determine. The greater number of MSS„

' and all the older editions, have ‘ad hunc,’

which is the reading followed by the Scho-
liasts Acron and Porphyrion, though Bent-
ley, by not quoting the latter correctly,
makes him favour his reading, ‘ad hoc.’

‘Ad hunc' is rendered‘ against him,' that
is, Antonius, who has not been mentioned
but* is sufficiently implied' 111 the preceding
verses. [Rittery who has ‘ad hunc fre·
mentes' explains it ‘adversus militem
spadonibus servientem frementesss] Orelli
and Dillenbr„ deserting the MSS„ adopt
the conjecture of Fen, ‘at hoc,’ and join
‘ hoc' with ‘frementes.’ It appears to me
to give but a lame sentence, and I prefer
following good MSS. ‘At huc’ were the
words Cruquius’ commentator had before
him, and Oruquius found them in two of
his MSS„ and in others 98 9 various read-
ing. Orelli mentions others that have the
same. ‘ Huc,' 98 Cruquius and his Scho-
liast remark, means ‘ to our side,’ as Vel-
leius (ii. 84) says, “Hine ad Antonium
nemo, illinc ad Caesarem quotidie aliquid '
transfiigiebatss’ ‘ Frementes' will then go
with ‘ equos,’ to which it appears naturally
to belong. Horace means that part of the
enemy’s soree deserted to Caesar. For the
expression ‘canentes Caesarem' compare
Virg. (Aen. vii. 698)2 “ Ibant aequati
numero regemque canebant? The ‘Gauls’
were cavalry of Galatia (or Gallograecia)
under Deiotarus their king, and his general
(who afterwards succeeded him) Amyntas.
See Juv. (vii. 16) ε “Altera quos nudo
traducit Gallia talo.’' [Verterunw as
Ritter remarks.]
