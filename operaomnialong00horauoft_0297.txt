Q. HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN SAEOULARE.

——0—

Wmnt Angustus had completed the period of ten years for which the imperial power s
was at first placed in his hands (Am-c. 727—737), he determined to celebrate his suc—

cess at home and abmad by an extraordinary festival, and he took as his model the
Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which had in former times been observed as a means of pro·

Ῐςῖ- ” pitiating the infernal deities, Dis and Proserpina, on occasions of great public calami-
· ’ ties. lt does not appear that this festival ever was held at regular intervals. How

therefore the name Ludi Saeculares arose is not clear: but as it was now for the first time
given, it wa probably convenient to have it believed that the games were no more than
tho observ-noe of a periodical solemnity. The Qnindecimviri were ordered to consult
the Sibyllina books, and they reported, no doubt as they were desired, that the time was
come when this great national festival should be repeated, and the details of it were
laid down in a set of hexameter Greek verses, which have been preserved by the histo-
rian Zosimus, who gives a description of the festival (ii. 5). [Zosimus names the verses
ἢν Σιβύλλης χρησμόν = and he says that they have been reported by others before
him-J 'nne verses will be found at the end of the ode.

. sinos Dis and Proserpina were the divinities chiefly invoked in the ancient gamen,

*the question arises, Why were Apollo and Diana the leading deitioe on this occasion ἲ

’ If it be admitted that the festival was observed as a matter *of convenience and not

from any religions feeling, it is not difficult to understand that the older proeedents
wem only generally adopted, and the deities most in fashion were as a matter of course
substituta! for the obsolete Dis and Proserpina. Angustus considered himself especially
undem-the pmtcction of Apollo, and the attributes assigned in the olden time to the
infin-nal deifice, as the originators and averters of physical evils, had by this time been
transferred to Apollo and his sister as representing the snn and moon, as Mitscherlich
lus observed. Orelli on this point quot& with approval some remarks of Jahn on Virg.
1:01. iv. 10 to this effect : that a notion commonly existed among the Greeks, and also
among the Etruscans and Romans, that the universe was moving in a cycle the com-
pletion of which would measure one great ‘year of the world ; that this year was divided
into ten months or ages (saecula), the length of which was not defined but was declared
from time to. time, 88 they were completed, by prodigies sent from heaven. This
accounts for the irregular celebration of the Saecular games at Rome. The Sibylline
b⁰⁰k82 he goes on to say, declared which diviuity especially presided over each mouth 3
Satura presided over the first and Apollo the last, Diana over the last but one, as in the
civil year she claimed November as her own particular mouth. This is the reason why
these divinities were worshipped rather than others, because on the appearance of the
comet at the death of C. Julius Caesar it was announced by the soothsayer Volcatius
that the ninth (Diana’s) mouth was passing away and the tenth was then beginning.
This account evidently has reference to the great Platonic year, which, when complete,
is to bring all the heavenly bodiae back to their original relative places. 'rhat the
