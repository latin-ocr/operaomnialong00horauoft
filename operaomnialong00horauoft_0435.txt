They rely upon an epigram of

that sense 1 take it, not with Torrentius.
To assume from Juvenal (x. 117) that the
regular payment at oue of these cheap
schools was an ‘as‚’ and that ‘aera' is
equivalent to ‘‚asses ’ is uuwarranted.
The‘ as 'there referred to was the Miner-
val, a voluntary offex-mg presented by each
scholar to his master at the Quinquatria,
the festival of Minerva. The terms no
doubt varied, though they must have
been low at this Venusian school, and
at all, compared with those of modern
da s.

age Horace was sent to Rome he does not
inform us. But it is probable he went
when he was twelve years old.

77. Artes quas doceat] Iu the earlier
days of Roman history the education of a
boy was of the simplest kind, consisting
chiefly of reading, writing, and arith-
metic. ‘Calculator’ and ‘notarius’ con-
tinued until the time of Martial to bc
names for a schoolmaster3 and, as ob-
served before (v. '72 n.), the majority
of boys learnt little more than the above
even in Horace's time. When Cicero was
a boy the learning of the twelve tables
formed a necessary part of education (Leg.
ii. 23)= “ Discebamus enim pueri duodecim
ut carmen necessarium, quas jam nemo
discit? Intercourse with Greece and the
Grreek towns of Italy brought a more lihe-v
ral class of studies to Rome, where Horace
says he studied Homer (Epp. ii. 2. 41).
Rhetoric was a brauch of study pursued
by the young Romans; ry likewise,
and Greek philoso p.hy Their studies eom-
menced under the teaching of the‘ paeda·
gogL’ and afterwards (till they assumed
the ‘toga virilis‚’ and in some cases
longer) at the ‘ludi literar-ii? private
schools which they attended as day scho-
lars. The ‘paedagogus' whose office was
of late growth at Rome and bort-owed
from Greeee, had the same functions as
the παιδαγωγός among the Greeks, and
was a slave as there. He was continually
about the boy, and went with him to his
masters. This task Horace’s father, who
could have had but few slaves, and had
none whom he could trust with such im·
portant duties, performed himself. Be-
sides the‘ paedagogus' (v. ¹74 n.,) other
slaves went with the boy to carry his bag,
and togive him consequence.
