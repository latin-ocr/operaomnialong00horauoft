336 HORATII FLACCI

SATIRE II.

This Satire appears to have been written on the death of Tigellius, a musician of
great repute, who, as we learn from the opening verse of the next Satire, had been on
tex-ms of familiar intimacy with C. Julius Caesar. Τ118 Scholiasta who call him M.
Hermogenes Tigellius say that he afterwards became a favourite with Cleopatra, and
then again with Augustus. Acron says Horace quarrelled with him because he found
fault with the rhythm of his verses. It is probable that this Tigellius is miscalled M.
Hermogenes, and that this name belongs only to another Tigellius who was also a singer
mentioned in S. 3. ofthis book, 129; 4. 72; 9. 253 10. 18, 80, 90. These persons had
never been separated till Dacier distinguished them. Heindorf adheres to the old opinion,
which I think has been satisfactorily disposed of by Kirchner in his treatise “ De Utro-
que Tigellio ” (Quaest. Hor. p. 42 sqq.). The Tigellius of this Satire is called Sardus,
a Sardiniam in the next (v. 3). It appears from the Scholiasts that 118 was attacked
by Licinius, from whom they quote this verse: “ Sardi Tigelli putidum caput venit.'’
He was probably therefore a libertinus. Cicero had a quarrel with this person, whose
influence with Caesar was such that it made him rather anxious, though hc affects in
some of his letters to hold the man cheap. Compare Epp. ad Fam. vii. 24. Ad Att.
xiii. 49, 50, and 51. He too alludes to Licinius' verse, and calls Tigellius “ hominem
pestilentiorem patria sua (the climate of Sardinia was counted very bad), eumque addic-
’ tum jam dudum Calvi Licinii Hipponacteo praeconio ’' (Ad. Fam. l. c.). Τ118 cha-
racter of Tigellius is drawn cleverly in the opening verses of the next Satire.

Τ118 statement of the Scholiasts on v. 25 of this Satire, that some supposed (so Porph.
and Comm. Cruq. put it3 Acron says at once “ Maecenatem tangit '') that, under the
name Malchinus, Horace means to satirize Maecenm, seems to me unworthy of the least
credit. But it has had warm defenders, and upon this assumption the date of the Satira
is fixed, both Kirchner and Franke placing it in A.U.c. 714, in order to allow sufficiant
time between the composition of the libel and the introduction of Horace to his patron.
Ι will not trouble the reader by going into the argument, except to say that, if the libel
was keen enough to offend, it is as improbable Horace would have published as that he
would have written it after his introduction to Maecenas 5 and if (as appears to me) there
is nothing to offend in the verse. it was as probably written after as before their acquaint-
ance began. But I do not believe Maecenas had any thing to do with the verse at all.
An early date must be assigned to the Satire, because it certainly preceded the 4th, and
that again was composed before the lOth of this Book. Whether the coarseness of the
ideas and language, and the want of artistic arrangement and connexion, may not be
an argument for an early date, deserves consideration. (See Introduction to S. 4.) It
is without exception the coarsest of all Horace's Satires, and, with reference to the point
it professes to turn upon, the least to the purpose. 1 can trace no connexion between
the text which is contained in v. 24 (“fools trying to avoid one class of vices run into
their opposites ”) and the licentious language and advice contained in the latter half of
the Satire‚ which in brief amounts to this: ‘ do not let a false ambition lead you into
intriguing with married women, but make yourself happy with prostitutes.’ The
examples which appear to be to the purpose are not so in reality. Tigellius, we may be
sure, did nott give his money to harlots and impostors in* order to avoid the character
of a miser 3 nor did Fufidius drive hard usurious bai-gains, cheat young men with good
expectations, and deny and tor-ment himself, in order to avoid the charge of extrava-
gance. If one man wore his tunic down to his ancles, it was because he was sloveuly or
effeminate ; if another tucked his up so as to expose his person, it was because he was
