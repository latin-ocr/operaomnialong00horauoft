stultus3 aut ex consuetudine puerorum
sumptum: solent euim pueri deridentes
nescientibus a tergo caudam suspendere ut
velut pecus caudam trahant '' (Porph.).

have ariseu.

— Est genus unum] Compare with this
the language of Socrates 111 Xenophon
(Mem. i. 1. 14), τῶν τε ’γὰρ μαινομένων
τοὺς μὲν οὐδὲ τὰ δεινὰ δεδιέναι, τοὺς δὲ καὶ
τὰ μὴ φοβερὰ φοβεῖσθαι.

56. varum] Baxter gives from a Scho-
liast “ Pedes in diversum flexos habentes
varos dicimus,’' and he was the first to take
¹ varum ' into the text, the universal read-
ing before having been ‘varium,’ which
Bentley reads, not noticing ‘varum' (S. i.
3. 47 11.). There is MSS. authority for
‘varum ’ and ‘ varium.’

57. clamet amica mater] “ Haec com-
posite proferenda sunt: videntur autem
sumpta a Graeca tragoedia φίλη μήτηρ ”
(00111111. Cruq.). This Scholiast is no doubt
right: but some commentators take ‘amica'
for the man's mistress [and point thus:
‘Clamet amica, Mater honesta, soror,'
&c.]. The word ‘ cognatis ’ embraces all
blood relations who can truce back their
origin to a common pair of aneestors.
[‘ Clamet,' ‘ though she should cry out.']

59. serva] ‘Take carel' a word 00111-
mon in the comic writers. [Ter. Ad. ii.

60.]Fufius] Or Fusius. Nothing more
is known of this actor or of Catienus. The
story of Polydorus, the son of Priam,.is
that which Euripides relates iu the He·
cuba, that he was entrusted to the care of

Esto ! 65

Polymestor, king of Thrace, and murdered
by him for his gold. Another legend makes
him entrusted to the care of his sister
Ilione, who was wife of the above Poly-
mestor. She, for some reason, put him in
the place ofher own son Deiphilus, and the
latter was brought up as her brother.
When the Greeks took Troy they required
Polymestor to put Priam's son to death,
and he accordingly killed Deiphilus. On
this story Pacuvius founded a tragcdy called
Ilione, and in oue of the soenes the ghost
of Deiphilus is introduced in his mother’s
bed-chamber, calling upon her to give his
body burial in these words (Cic. Tunc.
Disp. i. 44) :—

“ Mater, te adpello quae curam somno sus-
pensam levas,
Nessffuffissnei miseret, surge et sepeli

Fufius acted Ilione, and Catienus was Dei-
philus. Fufius was so druuk that he fell
fast asleep, and Horace says if twelve hun-
dred Catieni had screamed in his ear he
would not have heard. His part was to
star-t up and cry to the vanished ghost, like
Hamlet,—“ Age, adsta, mane, audi, itera.-
dum eademniet ista mihi '' (Cic. Acad.
Prior. ii. 27). Cicero made n proverb of
these words. ‘Maten te appello‚’ using them
in various illustrations. See pro Sestio,
0. 59. [‘ Edormitz' ‘sleeps out his part’
instead of acting it. ‘Edormire crapu-
lam,' ‘to sleep off drunkenness.’]

63. Errorz’ similem] ‘Errorem' is un·
derstood, and it is governed by ‘ insanire ’.
as a cognate accusative, ‘error ' being equi-
valent to ‘insania' Comp. Epp. i. 1. 101 ε
“ Insanire putas sollemnia me neque rides.”
