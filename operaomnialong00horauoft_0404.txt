Excerpam numero: neque enim concludere versum

HORATII FLACCI

Dixeris esse satis ,- neque si qui scribat uti nos
Sermoni propiora, putes hunc esse potitam.
Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior atque os
Magna sonaturum, des nominis hujus honorem.

Idcirco quidam comoedia necne poEma

45

Esset quaesivere, quod acer spiritus ac vis
Nec verbis nec rebus inest, nisi quod pede certo

Differt sermoni, sermo meruS.

“ At pater ardens

Saevit, quod meretrice nepos insanus amica

Filius uxorem grandi cum dote recuset,

Ebrius et, magnum quod dedecus, ambulet ante

Noctem cum facibus.”

Numquid Pomponius istis

Audiret leviora pater si viveret? Ergo
Non satis est puris versum perscribere verbis,

Satires and Epistles. ‘ Si qui ’ is the read-
ing of some of the Vatican MSS„ one of
the Berne, and two of Bentley's. The edi-

* tions and most MSS. have ‘ quis? [Ritter
has ‘ siquis.']

43. os Mayna sanaturum] This form does
not appear elsewhere. Cicero uses ‘ prae-
staturus: and Sall. (J ug. 47). Priscian
quotes ‘sonaturus' from Hora-ce. Horace
has ‘intonata ’ in Epod. ii. 51. The attri-
butes of a poet which Horace considers es-
sential, are genius, inspiration, and digni-
fied sentimenta and language suited to high
subjects. See Virg. (G. iii. 294) t “ Nunc
veneranda Pales, magno nunc ore sonan-
dum.’' Lambinus quotes from Petronius
Arbiter, C. 118, the following sensible re·
marks on this subject 2-“ Multos, inquit
Eumolpus, Ο juvenes, carmen decepit z nam
ut quisque versum pedibus instruxit, sen·
sumque teneriorem verborum ambitu in·
texuit, putavit se continuo in Heliconem
venisse. Sic forensibus ministeriis exer-
citati frequenter ad carminis tranquillita-
tem tauquam ad portum faciliorem refuge-
runt credentes facilius poema exstrui posse
quam controversiam sententiolis vibranti-
bus pictam. Ceterum neque generosior spi-
ritus vanitatem amat, neque concipere aut
edere partum mens potest nisi ingenti flu-
mine literarum inundata.’' (Ed. Burmann.)

45. Idcirco quidam] In reference to
this, certain persons have raised the ques-
tion whether a comedy was or was not a
poem : “ utrum comoedia esset poema
necne esset '³ (Key’s L. G. 1423). This is
a grammarian's question, and depends upon
the definition assumed for a poem, in which

however imagination is generally supposed
to have a conspicuous place, and this would
exclude the comedies of Plautus and Ter-
ence, and their Greek originals of the new
comedy, from the title of poetry. But the
same rule would exclude much more that
has passed for poetry‚ with less pretension
to the name than Horace's Satires or the
Heautontimorumenos. ‘ Quidam ’ siguifies
the grammarians of Alexandria, who arc
also referred to by Cicero, “video visum
esse nonnullis'' (v. 39 note).

48. Differ-t sermoni] ‘Discrepare, ‘dis-
sidere,’ ‘distare,' ‘differre‚' Horace uses
with the dative (C. i. 27, 5 11), but the two
last also with the ablative and ‘ab.'

At pater ardens] Demea iu the Adel-
phi of Terence is an instance in point. ‘Aa’
which usually in such places introduces an
objectioni, here seems to be the remark of
one who supposed that the sury and rant-
ing of the enraged father in the comedy
might be supposed to partake of the fire of
poetry. But Horace disposes of the objec-
tion very easily. Any father who had such
a son as Pomponius for instance (of whom
we know nothing more), a dissolute youth,
would probably storin at him in much the
same terms that the man on the uses.
It was the aim of the New Comedy, which
the Roman writers followed, to put real
life upon the stage by means of a plot na-
tural and probable, and to represent men
and women as they were seen and heard
every day, in which it differed essentially
from the Old Comedy, a mere vehicle for
political satire. (See above, v. 1 n.)

54. puris—verbis] This is a common
