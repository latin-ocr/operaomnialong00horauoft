vary between Maltinus, Malthinus, and
Malchinus. of these the first is the only
historical name, having been the surname‚
accordingto Justin (xxxviii. 3), of Man-

lius, who went as ambassador to Mithri-

dates. This· is of no great importance, for
Horace did not confine himself to real
names, though Madvig Opusc. 74) says he
did. The oldest Berne S. has Maltinus,
and Orelli adopts it. The Scholiasta had
Malthinus, which is Heindorf’s [and Rit-
ter's] reading. Judging from Fea’ s list and
Bcntley’s assertion, the majority of MSS.

have Malchinus. That is the reading of
Ven. (1483) and nearly all the earliest
editions. Bentley adopts it against Mal³

thinus, which was the common reading at
that time. He derives it from Malchus,
which was an eastern name, or a corrup-
tion osone. 'l'he Scholiasts say that the
name is derived from μαλθακός, and that
Horace alludes to Maecenas because he
was said to wear bis tunic long, a sign of

That Maecenas was spoken of as effeminate
in his habits is wel] known, and the cir-
cumstance of his wearing long tunics is
mentioned by Seneca (Ep. civ. ξ 6) : ‘⁸ Hunc
esse qui solutis tunicis in urbe semper in-

cesserit? nam etiam quum absentis Cae-

saris partibus fungeretur signum a dis-

author of the elegy on his death: —

“Quod discinctus eras animo quoque, ear-
pitur unum,
Diluitur nimia simplicitate tna.
Sic illi vixere quibus fuit aurea virgo,
Quae bene praecinctos postmodo pulsa
