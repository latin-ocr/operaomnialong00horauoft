HORATII FLAC CI

Si cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim
Sisyphus 5 hunc varum distortis cruribus 5 illum
Balbutit scaurum pravis fultum male talis.

Parcius hic vivit, frugi dicatur.
Et jactantior hic paulo est, concinnus amicis

Postulat ut videatur.

Ineptus

Plus aequo liber, simplex fortisque habeatur 3

Caldior est, acres inter numeretur.

Haec res et jungit junctos et servat amicos.

At nos virtutes ipsas invertimus, atque
Sincerum cupimus vas incrustare.

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homo : illi

troduces such a one at a supper, dancing
grotesquely to the sound of the flute :—

“ Nanus et ipse suos breviter concretus in
J agtgblgt truncas ad cava bux(a mgiiusfli
ν. sq.

That ‘varus ’ is a soft term for those who
have bent legs, and ‘scaurus’ for one
“ whose ankles are rickety, we may gether
from this passage, not from the dictiona-
ries. No one would like to have a child
either ‘varus' or ‘scaurus' according to
Forcellini's definitions. Celsus (viii. 20) de-
fines ‘ varus ’ as one whose foot turns in 3
and Heindorf says it represents the shape
of the letter V. From this word is derived
‘praevaricari‚’ ‘ to shuffle.' Lucretius
describes the blindness of lovers much as
Horace does that of fathers (iv. 1156
Sqttlffl). Inepta-⁹] This word signifies want
of what the French know well by the name
of ‘tact.’ Cicero thus defines the word
(de Or. ii. 4) : “ qui aut tempus quid pos-
tulet non videt, aut plura loquitur aut se
ostentat—aut denique in aliquo genere
aut inconcinnus aut multus est, is ineptus
dicitur.” Such a man's failing is to be
softened down, Horace says, into a wish
to make himself agreeable (concinnus) to
his friends. ‘ Truculentior ’ means coarse
and approaching to brutality in his be-
haviour.

56. Sine-erum cupimus vas incrustata-e]

‘We are ready and even anxious to foul the
clean vessel? This is the original mean-
ing of‘ sincerus?

57. multum est demissus homo] ‘De-
missus' is used in a bad sense. Bentley
says this passage is a rock of bad name for
the shipwreck all interpreters have made
upon it. ‘¹ Scopulus interpretum omnium

 

50
At est truculentior atque ·
Opinor
55
Probus quis
naufragiis infamis.’' His reading is—
probus quis

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homo
ille :
Tardo ac cognomen pingui damus?

‘Ille' for ‘illi' has the authority of the
oldest Blandinian MS„ according to Cru-
quius. ⁸ Ac ' is Bentley’s own conjecture.
The translation will then be: ‘suppose we
have an honest man living among ue, a
ii? 12¹3?ssss 32¹2?ss m³i⁰f25⁰1⁷1230 55⁸3
which must agree with ‘tau-<lox and that
must be taken in a good sense as slow and
steady. That ‘demissus’ may be used in
a good sense, and is so used by Cicero in
connexion with ‘probus,' is ,quite true
(Orat. ii. 43): “ eaque omnia quae probo-
rum, demissorum, non acrium-nou acer-
borum sunt ;” but it is also used in a dis-
paraging way. Bentley says it may be
doubted whether ‘multum’ belong-s to
‘vivit’ or ‘demissus.’ Tbere cannot, Ι
think, be much doubt that it belongs to
‘ demissus‚’ and it strengthens the common
interpretation—³ a very abject man? Com-
pare S. ii. 3. 147, “multum celer atque
fidelis.'’ “Multum similis metuenti ” (S.
ii. 5. 92). Lambinus, with some autho-
rity, inserts ‘est’ before ‘demissum' It
does not appear in the best Mss„ but is
understood. Heindorf’ s interpolation of

‘’et after‘ pingui’ is unnuthorized and
awkward. The dative ‘pingui ’like“ cui
nunc cognomen Iulo Additur” (Aen. i.
267)‚· is the common construction. Cicero
(Verr. ii. 4. 53) has “ cui nomen Arethusa
est ;'’ but there Professor Key (L. G. 984
note) thinks “ we should probably read
Arethusaest, i. e. Arethusae est.” Some
MSS. have ‘ pinguis’ in the text. [Ritter
and Kriiger: ‘ multum demissus homo iuer]
