this use of ‘ sed ' see C. iv. 4. 2211. ‘Ultro’
means here wantonly, without provocation
or cause. (C. iv. 4. 51 n.) The MSS.
vary as usual between ‘destringere’ and
‘distringere’ See C. iii. 1. 17 n. Orelli
[and Ritter] prefer ‘destringere,’ Hein-
dorf ‘distringere' Having adopted ‘dis-
tringere' in the above passage, I do so
here, without feeling quite certain which

reat’ is an imitation of the Greek use of
ὣς, expressing a wish. From ‘ at ille ’ the
construction is a little irregular, but the
abruptness of the several clauses is well
suited to the occasion : ‘ but for that man
that provokes me, he had better not touch
me, I cry 3 he'll suffer if he does‚' &a It

47. Cervius iratus-urnam] Comm.
Cruq. is the only Scholiast who gives any
account of this man. He says: “ Cervius
Ascanii libertus calumniator accusavit Cn.
Calvinum lege de Sicariis.'' Estre, fol-
lowing Lambinus, thinks we should read
Servius, and that the person meant is
Servius Pola, whom Cicero mentions as a
low informer (ad Quintum Frat. ii. 13).
His friend Coelius, writing to Cicero (ad
Fam. viii. 12), mentions this Pola as one
whom his enemies were trying to enlist to
lay an information against him. The
person he is said by the Scholiast to have
informed against is Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
consul A.U.c. 701. Another Cervius is
mentioned below (S. ii. 6. 77). ‘ Urnath ’
means the urn into which the judices in
criminal trials put their tablets, or that
into which their names were put for draw-

ing the jury, as the Scholiasts say.
48. Canidia Albuci quibus] Acron

under-stands this to mean Canidia the
daughter of Albucius. Porphyrion says,
“ Amphibolice posuit :’' for it may be either
what Acron says or the poison of Albucius ε
“ hic enim Albucius veneno uxorem suam
dicitur peremisse.'’ Comm. Cruq. takes it
the first way, referring to Virgil’s “Dei’-
phobe Glauci'' (Aen. vi. 36). Duentzer
goes further, and supposes Canidia to have
been ‘ amica Albucii 3' that he is identical
with the Varus of Epod. v.‚ and had his
name, as she hers, from his white hair,
which is all mere invention. Porphyrion's
story may be assumed to be the true one,
or like the truth‚ Albucius being a person
notorious for having poisoned somebody.
We meet with another Albucius below (S.
2. 67), whom Porphyrion identifies with
this person, and says he poisoned his wife
because 110 wanted to marry another
woman. ,2

49. Grande malum struis of this
person we know nothing ς b'ut orphyrion
says, “ Hic praetor fuit apud quem accu-
satus est a Cicerone Verres Hortensio de·
fendente ;'’ but on that occasion Μ’ Aci-
lius Glabrio was praetor. Comm. Cruq.,
in a note of which the text is very cor-
rupt, calls him C. Marius Turius3 and
{ZysprlgiXegsatJnyzffegotrffiptffissngvetffig
tablets of different colours, that he might
know which of the judices voted according
to his wishes‚—whieh is clearly all taken
from a misunderstanding of the words
Cicero puts into the mouth of Hortensius
(Divin. c. 7). The words “magnus ille
defensor et amicus ejus ’³ (i. e. of Verres),
by which Cicero means Hortensius, the
Scholiast applies to Turius. The Pseudo-
Asconius (p. 109, ed. Orelli) on the above
