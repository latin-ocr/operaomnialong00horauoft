HORATII FLACCI

Unde datum sentis lupus hic Tiberinus an alto

Captus hiet, pontesne inter jactatus an amnis

Ostia sub Tusci? Laudas, insane, trilibrem

Mullum in singula quem minuas pulmenta necesse est.

Ducit te species video : quo pertinet ergo
Quia scilicet illis

Proceros odisse lupos?

Majorem natura modum dedit, his breve pondus.

mentioned, but to that which the speaker
prefers, or is defending; just as we have
‘ his ' and ‘illis ’ changing places below
(36, 37). [‘ nihil hac magis illa‚—patet:'
Orelli (3rd ed.) and Ritter, who adds that
‘pavo’ is the ‘subjectun1‚' that ‘hac’ re-
fers to a peacock boiled (cocto), which has
just been mentioned, and ‘illa ’ to the same
bird roasted ‘ et cauda ornatam de qua
paulo ante dictum est ' (v. 26). He says
' that the explanation given in this note is
shown to be false by the fact that there is a
difference between the flesh of a fowl and
a peacock. But there is also a difference
between boiled and roasted. Doederlein
explains this verse in a way of his own 3
which the curious may see]

31. Unde datum sentis] The sentence
goes on thus: ‘be it so: grant that you
may be taken in by the eye in the matter
of the bird with a fine tail ς but what sense
can tell you whether such and such a fish
was caught in a particular part of the river,
or at its mouth, or in the open sea P’ That
part of the river which is meant by ‘inter
pontes ’ lay between the Pons Fabricius,

which joined the Insula Tiberina with the ,

left bank, and the Pons Sublicius, and
between these bridges the Cloaca Maxima
emptied itself. It would not require a
very keen epicure to distinguish a fish
caught in those waters; and the fish taken
at sea, if it was the same flsh, would be out
of season and coarse. [Pliny (H. N. ix.
c. 54) quoted by Ritter, says, ‘lupi pisces
(meliores sunt) in Tiberi amne iuter duos
pontes ;’ that is, they were the best that
were caught in the Tiber.] The ‘lupus’
is said to have been of the pike kind.
[‘ Unde datum hoc sumis P’ Persius, S. v.

33. Ostia sub Tusci] ‘Sub’ with an
accusative of place generally has a verb of
motion, and means ‘ close up to ς’ and if it

be so understood here, the verb of motion
must be supplied, ‘as you approach close
up to.' The Tiber is called Tuscus amnis,
as (O. i. 20. 5) it is said to be Maecenas'
‘ paternum flumen,’ because it rises in
Etruria.

34. Mullum] Martial speaks of one of
two pounds as the least that should be put
upon a fine dish z
“ Grandia ne viola parvo chrysendeta

mu ος

Ut minimum libras debet habere duas.’'

(xiv. 9¹7.)
This Pliny (Η. N. ix. 30) says was a size
it rarely exceeded. The bearded mullet,
as it was called, was held in highest
esteem.

36. Quia scilieet illie] ‘Illis’ does not
refer to the more remote object here, but
to the nearer, as in v. 29 (see note). ‘His’
refers to the mullets. [Ritter makes
‘ illis’ the mullets and ‘his’ the pike 3 and
takes it ironically.] ”

[38. Jejunus raro] A s‘omach seldom
hungry despises common things, as Ritter
and others take it.]

[40. Vellem] Heindorf says that it
ought to be ‘ velim‚' and so he conjectures
‘ velle ait.' But ‘ vellem ' seems to mean
that the glutton is expressing his dissutis-
faction with the dish which is before him,
because it does not correspond to what he
would choosc‚ if he could choose.]

-—- At vos, praesentes Austri] ‘Now
may ye, O potent south winds.’ ‘At’ is
a particle of exclamation when a. sudden
emotion is expressed‚ as mentioned above
(Epod. v. 1). The wiuds are invoked as
deities. As to ‘praesens’ in this applica-
tion, see C. i. 35. 2.

41. Quamquam] ‘Though 1 need not
invoke your help3 for the boar and the
turbot lose their flavour when the stomach
is gorgcd aud seeks stimulante?
